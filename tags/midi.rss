              <p>I recently purchased a Linnstrument (what a great controller!) and made two sound engines for it. Here is a video showing it off.<br>The patches are now in the community library. Go to <code>File-&gt;Library-&gt;community-&gt;TSG-&gt;MPE</code> to try them out for yourself.</p>

<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="XNx5zb3PuAw" data-youtube-title="" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>

<p><strong>Important note:</strong> Due to an issue with axolotis voice allocation in mpe subpatches, I use a modified version of the <code>midi/ctrl/mpe</code> object. This version resets the pitch bend to zero on each new note to avoid erratic tuning and weird sticking pitch bend troubles. This works fine as long as you have Linnstrument in its quantized mode - meaning that a note is quantized on an initial button press (of course bending works just fine).  The bug is about to be fixed and will most likely be included in the next firmware update, according to <a class="mention" href="/users/thetechnobear">@thetechnobear</a>. I will then remove this message and revert to the factory <code>midi/ctrl/mpe</code> object.</p>

              <p>Hey I just got this TouchMe MIDI controller that measures resistance rather than capacitance to send MIDI notes.

<p>Here is a link for it: <a href="https://shop.playtronica.com/touchme" rel="nofollow noopener">https://shop.playtronica.com/touchme</a><br>It looks like it's sending power to the TouchMe, but it's not recognizing my touch on the main pads that send the notes.

              <p>Hello,</p>

<p>Is there anybody who can help me with following matter?</p>

<p>I want to control 2 of the knobs (e.g. volume and vibrato or reso, or other(s)) with the sensors (Volume and Pitch) on the left and right hand side of my Moog Theremini to control the by hand movements cq hand gestures.</p>

<p>According to Moog it is possible via CC2 (Volume) and CC20 (Pitch) to connect it to USB from Axocontrol.</p>

<p>I am using the patch Little Classic of (Thank you!) TIAR. </p>

<p>I do not know where i can do it. Does anybody know? </p>

<p>The Theremini is recognized  by Axoloti:</p>

<p>I know it is not possible to send note MIDI's to axocontrol, but maybe it is possible to use the Windows Axoloti software and use the keyboard within the program!</p>

<p>I tried to find a way, but me as a newbie I don't know where to start and to look a way to find the parameters and the way to match it with the CC Midi codes of the Theremini.</p>

<p>I sthere anyone who can and is willing to help me?</p>

<p>Greetings Peter</p>

              <p>I've rigged up a midi controller using a Teensy LC board today and it is capable of outputting cc signals via USB....unfortunately my USB input is currently occupied by my midi controller (Oxygen 49 MKIII) </p>

<p>I'm wondering if there are some pins on the board that I can solder an additional USB input to so I can connect my Teensy while my Oxygen controller is plugged into the main USB input....Also hoping this is possible so I can attach my Oxygen directly to the Axoloti and still have the usb accessible when I eventually throw them both into a custom enclosure.... </p>

<p>I'm also wondering if I could even just wire the Teensy directly to the board through rather than adding another USB....the Teensy can be powered using 3.3v off the Axoloti and I'm certain it can output its midi signals through a pin rather than through USB. </p>

<p>Here are some HD pictures of the Axoloti board...if anyone can point out where the USB/MIDI pins are ---- assuming the exist ---- I'd be very grateful and will have a really cool looking synth to show everyone soon!<br>          <a href="https://i.imgur.com/z2ZDj6j.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">

              <p>Hi there, after a year or so of tinkering, I'm about ready to put my Axoloti into an enclosure. I built a mod matrix with a Teensy and a 4x4 Neotrellis and will be hijacking the MIDI pins behind the DIN input for sending MIDI to the AXO, which should throw a switch in the patch that will route the modulation source to the desired location.</p>

<p>I want to have two layers to the matrix, so I'll need to be able to send messages to 32 separate toggles.  I'm not sure what the "proper" MIDI messages to handle this would be, and I'd like to not build something that shoots future me in the foot.</p>

<p>Should I try to find 32 different CC's and send 0 or 127 for off and on, or should I use a handful of CC's and use different CC values to indicate which toggle I'm trying to address? Or is there a preferred method that I don't know about?</p>

<p>Thanks a ton,<br>Brennan</p>

              <p>Hy guys,</p>

<p>it's about controlling more effects for my guitar using the same potentiometers. The idea is to control a parameter of one effect (f.e. a mix) with a potentiometer. When the rotary switch is on the second position the very same potentiometer should control a different parameter. In short: i wanna control more parameters with one single potentiometer.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Rotary on pos 1. &gt; Potentiometer is controlling Parameter 1 of effect 1<br>Rotary on pos 2. &gt; Potentiometer is controlling Parameter 1 of effect 2 ... and so on</p>

<p>I couldn't find any post which pushes me on the right way, so sorry if bothering: maybe on of you can give me an idea how to get the integer into changing the CC.</p>

<p>I've found very useful posts to get the rotary to an integer and to control the parameter with my poti. But how can i connect both concepts. Sorry, if this is maybe already solved an i'm to dumb to find it.</p>

<p>Thx for your help!</p>

              <h1>Overview</h1>

<p>This topic is intended to discuss USB midi controllers and their compatibility with Axoloti.</p>

<p>Please post here if you use a controller that works and is not listed here, and we will keep this post up to date.</p>

<p>if you find a controller that does NOT work, then please <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/troubleshooting-usb-midi-controllers-not-listed-as-compatible-yet/217">read this topic</a>, and then <strong>raise a separate topic</strong> in this hardware category, so we can discuss the issue, and look for a resolution. please do not start a conversation here.</p>

<h1>USB Midi Device vs USB Midi Host</h1>

<p>Most hardware are either a midi device or a midi host, but Axoloti can be both, so its important to be clear on the distinction.</p>

<p>When using midi over USB, a piece of hardware takes on the role of either a <strong>host</strong> or a <strong>device</strong> for a single wired connection. <br>i.e. </p>

<pre><code>   USB Midi Host &lt;------&gt; USB Midi Device</code></pre>

<p>Obviously a 'dumb' midi controller (e.g. keyboard) is a USB midi device, this means when you connect it it needs to connect to something that can 'host' it. This might be a computer, or it might be a synth.</p>

<p>A computer is (generally) a USB midi host, since you connect midi controllers to it i.e. it hosts theses controllers.</p>

<p>Often USB midi hosts can host many USB midi devices at the same time, but generally a USB midi device is connected to one host</p>

<p>Axoloti , like some synths, can be both, if you connect via the micro usb port (the one you use to connect to a computer), it acts as usb midi device. if you connect it to something (e.g. a midi keyboard) via the full size usb port, then it will host other usb midi devices.<br>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>   Computer (host) &lt; -----&gt; (device) Axoloti (host) &lt;-------&gt; (device) usb keyboard</code></pre>

<p>It should be noted, generally both hosts and devices can send and receive data.</p>

<h1>Axoloti acting as a USB Midi Device</h1>

<p>If you connect to the Axoloti micro usb port, Axoloti presents itself as a class compliant midi <strong>device</strong>, and should be accessible on all class compliant hosts.</p>

<p>Capabilities: class compliant usb device, send/receive note, pitchbend, pressure and cc data.<br>Current limitations: no sysex support</p>

<p>Current tested hosts:<br>- Windows<br>- Mac OSX<br>- Linux (PC/VmWare/Raspberry PI 2)<br>- Axoloti Core<br>- iOS  (v8.3 (4s), v5 (iPad1), iPad 2) can be powered from iOS device </p>

<h1>Axoloti providing USB Midi Hosting</h1>

<p>If you connect a USB midi device into the Axoloti's full size USB port, Axoloti will act as a USB Midi <strong>host</strong></p>

<p>Capabilities: host for class compliant midi devices, can send and receive note, pitchbend, pressure and cc data.</p>

<p>Current limitations: <strong>No support for connecting via hubs</strong>, no sysex input support, sysex output only via api call.</p>

<p>Bus power: <strong>must not exceed 500mA</strong><br>(if you have issues with a device when using bus power, if the device permits, try using external power) </p>

              <p>I'm trying to create a subpatch that allows me to turn a row of 8 buttons on a MIDI controller (specifically for the Novation Launch Control XL, but the same could be applied to any amount of similar controllers) into shift/function buttons for 8 faders, effectively multiplying my amount of faders by 9 (unshifted + 8x with shift buttons). </p>

<p>I have managed to get this to work, relying heavily on the "rbrt/control/gate_hold" object, but there are two major problems:</p>

<p>1) while any of the shift buttons are pressed, the CC from the unshifted group is also sent. Is there a way to multiply/sum bools in such a way that the unshifted group is filtered out while any of the shift buttons are pressed?</p>

<p>2) when any of the shift buttons are pressed, the CC values of all 8 faders in that shift group are updated. I would want that only a fader that is moved while pressing shift is updated, not all of them. I've tried chaining 2 "rbrt/control/gate_hold" objects in series (one gated by the shift button, one gated by the trig output of the "midi/in/cc" objects of the individual faders), but this has no effect. How could I go about that?</p>

<p>Attracted by the Orba Artiphon to use it as a midi controller for the Axoloti I bought one! I was especially interested in the simple design and the gestures possibilities  and midi options to use it as a mini keyboard e.g.</p>

<p>But i am not sure how to implement the MIDI connections. IN this case the Axoloti will be the host and the Orba the controller via USB. Axoloti recognizes the Orba, but it states "Mid class fail to init"</p>

          <title>Help advise a total and complete beginner on how to build my enclosure!</title>

              <p>Warning: this post is long and is written by an incredibly ambitious and clueless person. </p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I made a preliminary post asking about the enclosure I wanted to build, in order to make sure that it was realistic. Luckily, the good people of this community informed me that it was. Since the post, my Axoloti Core has arrived in the mail and I need to stop playing with it for 2 seconds so I can build an enclosure for the thing! There's no real rush, apart from my excitement to materialize this idea.</p>

<p>So, for the build<br><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/1fda1c65f10390095baed5dc7a0f7f2a90dd0886" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1fda1c65f10390095baed5dc7a0f7f2a90dd0886.png" class="lightbox" title="Rough front Labeled Border.png"><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/1/1fda1c65f10390095baed5dc7a0f7f2a90dd0886_1_687x500.png" width="687" height="500"><div class="meta">
<span class="filename">Rough front Labeled Border.png</span><span class="informations">2475x1800 289 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>
</div></a></div></p>

<p>This is a very rough sketch of the general idea. By rough, I mean I found the axo schematic somewhere on this site and pasted it into photoshop, eyeballing the size. Not a final product. The faceplate will be 8.25" x 6" (need to get more familiar with the metric system before I start using the Synth Panels Designer extension!) The enclosure will be inside of a prebuilt box, so the size of the faceplate is fixed. The Axoloti will be visible out the front, but only the in/outputs will be visible.</p>

<p>I tried to correctly place the dimensions of the OLED w/breakout board, as well as the 4x4 button grid correct to Adafruit's specs. As for the pots, I could't find the size of pots anywhere, so each one is inside a 1"x 1" square while the actual circle sizes are completely arbitrary. The knobs will probably be much thinner. </p>

<p><strong>Now for the parts I need help with.</strong></p>

<p>I'm a beginner to electronics. I've used a soldering iron before, but consider this the project I'm "beginning" electronics with. In my previous post, I was informed that I might want to get a multiplexer, while someone else suggested I get a Teensy 4.1 which would do the job a multiplexer would and transmit the signal from analog to midi. I've decided to go with the Teensy. Other than 'it sends midi signals and connects via usb', I haven't got a clue how a Teensy works.</p>

<p>The following questions will illustrate that I need help with basically everything, but I understand that answering answering all these questions might take you forever, so I'm willing to consume any material (video, books) that will answer these questions also. Please just point me where to go! </p>

<p>The questions (imagine that I don't even know if I'm asking the questions properly):</p>

<ul>
<li>How do I connect a Teensy to an Axoloti?</li>
<li>Do I need anything, aside from wires, between the Teensy and the Axoloti?</li>
<li>Will I be using resistors, capacitors, or additional electronic components for this project?</li>
<li>How does the Axoloti know that it's receiving midi signals instead of analog?</li>
<li>Is the teensy capable of handling all 16 knobs as well as the button grid, button grid LEDs, and the OLED, or should I be using the in/out pins (is that even the right terminology?) on the axoloti, or do I need an additional board to make all these connections?</li>
<li>Can I mount the pots straight to an aluminum faceplate with the nut/is there anything I need to know about that?</li>
<li>How to wire pots together.</li>
<li>Actually, how to wire everything together.</li>
<li>Something about 3.3 volts that sounded important (yes, it's very important, please tell me about this)</li>
<li>Can I use the OLED as an oscilloscope without any additional hardware?</li>
</ul>

<p>Bonus question:<br>- I found 2 Adafruit 12x16 bit PWM boards on the ground out of nowhere, can I use these somehow? I know that PWM is used on analog synths, and that the Axoloti is digital so it won't do me any good there, but I don't know any more than that!</p>

<p>My current shopping list (please add if I need anything)<br>- At least 2 breadboards for testing<br>- 16 pots (I have the knobs)<br>- A whole bunch of wire (are there different types of wire I should be using?)<br>- 128x64 OLED display<br>- 4x4 silicone button pad, LEDs for it, board with buttons that goes under the pad. <br>- Teensy board (how do I connect it to Axoloti?)</p>

<p>Please feel free to tell me anything I'm missing, and if I've left it out of the questions/list, assume that I don't know that it exists. I'm not worrying about programming the OLED for now, it appears that there are plenty of resources on this forum for that. </p>

<p>If you've made it this far, thanks so much for your time! Doubly so if you're answering any of the questions. I'm excited for this project, and I'm hoping to make a video afterwards to show everyone here, as well as my friends to blow their mind about the Axoloti.</p>

<p>If I've created a 4 voice synth and want to change parameters of each voice (lets say I want each voice's oscillators to be tuned differently for example) how would I go about doing this? orrr is it even possible?</p>

<p>In theory I guess I could assign a midi controller channel to each voice and fiddle with them that way but how would I edit each individual voice to listen for input from each one of those channels?</p>

<p>It seems like when I make a polyphonic patch by creating an object (./subpatchname) then im stuck with just one instance of the subpatch...editing the subpatch means editing every voice...</p>

<p>I use it mainly with the Axoloti, I feel it's a great match.</p>

<p>Only 24 hours to go to get a Striso board on Kickstarter!</p>

              <p>Hello there . Since a short time I got more and more into Axoloti.</p>

<p>Im Happy to share with you a solution made in python using a raspberry pi , and connecting several controllers to the pi and back to the axo , allowing multiple controllers to be used , and also extending on the same script I've managed to talk back to the LaunchControlXL from the axo patcher through the pi .</p>

<p><a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/raspberry-pi-as-hub-for-usb-midi-devices-advice/3110/8">All inspiration came from this post and the solution made by @lusol mentioned in this thread</a></p>

<p>Its a bit confusing but hopefully you get the idea</p>

<p>For anyone wanting to experiment here is the code in the github <a href="https://github.com/CarloCattano/MultiMidi_Axoloti" rel="nofollow noopener">GITHUB  CODE </a></p>

<p>1.<br>Now that Ive got what I need to run multiple controllers , I will try to experiment further into ableton link using puredata or a wrapper for python . Then small gates of 3.3v could be sent from the PI's GPIO's out to the axo and thats tempting to try for me , way easier and probably less messier than midi .</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There is a wonderfull library called Maximilian written in C++ for audio synthesis that performs really well in the pi , i might start to go deeper into the possibility of also using it as an extra audio source , now that is there.</p></li>
<li><p>Changed my mind and now I guess I will put the oled displays on the pi side of things . I will keep one on the axo for waveforms and meters but the rest could be easily transfered into the Pi and use some comunication from the patcher to talk to the callbacks</p></li>
</ol>

<p>**The code is still in proccess and its not meant to be ready to use for any case scenario , so you will have to add your controllers names on your own etc. Let me know here if you need some help with that .</p>

              <p>Hello everybody,</p>

<p>I have this 1999 Behringer class 2 mixer with midi out and I wanted to try to connect it to the Axoloti (note, I'm a complete noob) Maybe for that to work was quite optimistic in the first place, but I don't really know how all of this works (yet) and I thought well if it has a midi out I can connect it and it's going to work... Well...</p>

<p>I have all the latest versions installed and worked through the topics I could find on midi devices (it's not listed as compatible, neither as uncompatible)</p>

<p>In the patch I used a midi in monitor. I read in another post that it shows the incoming data on the console, which is the little window that opens first when you start the program I reckon. However no data shows up when I do stuff on the mixer. Now, I don't know if I have to put different settings on the mixer or maybe change something in the program or if it's just not going to work with this old mixer. I just find it very hard to give that idea up....</p>

<p>Maybe someone with more experience can tell me what is going on... Thanks for your effort!!</p>

              <p>Hi <span class="mention">@ll</span>,</p>

<p>I have my Axoloti now for some month but had no time to use it - until now! I want to manage a (perhaps) strange setup:</p>

<p>MIDI-USB -&gt; [USB-MIDI-Axoloti -&gt; [???] -&gt; MIDI-OUT-Axoloti]-&gt;external_MIDI_Arpeggiator-&gt;[MIDI-IN-Axoloti-&gt;Axoloti-Patch-&gt;...]</p>

<p>In words:<br>I want to use my small AKAI-MPK25-USB-MIDI keyboard connected to the Axoloti, but want to trigger Axoloti-patches via my external MIDI-Arpeggiator. How can this be arranged? I don't know what object to use for "[???]" in my simple circuit above and how to tell the patch to get the MIDI input from the DIN-MIDI in (instead of USB-MIDI).</p>

<p>I tried a little bit with some objects I found, but couldn't get it to work. Perhaps someone has a working patch or a hint where I can learn from?</p>

<p>Thanks, Holger</p>

              <p>Beginner questions.</p>

<p>My new midi keyboard doesn't have zones, so I looked into getting the Ax to do that for me.<br>I've done a lot of coding, but nothing on the Ax before.</p>

<p>Here's the script, modded from a simple thru found on the forum ( I've looked for a MidiThru object, seen mention of it but can't find the actual file)</p>

<p>if (dev == MIDI_DEVICE_USB_HOST) {<br>  uint8_t status_type = status &amp; 0xF0;<br>  uint8_t midi_ch     = status &amp; 0x0F;<br>  uint8_t split_note  = 0x3F;<br>  uint8_t left_zone_ch= 0x01;<br>  uint8_t right_zone_ch= 0x00;</p>

<p>  if ((status_type == MIDI_CONTROL_CHANGE) ||<br>      (status_type == MIDI_POLY_PRESSURE) ||<br>      (status_type == MIDI_PITCH_BEND)) {<br>    MidiSend3(MIDI_DEVICE_DIN,0,status,data1,data2);<br>  } else if ((status_type == MIDI_PROGRAM_CHANGE) ||<br>      (status_type == MIDI_CHANNEL_PRESSURE)) {<br>    MidiSend2(MIDI_DEVICE_DIN,0,status,data1);<br>  } else if ((status_type == MIDI_NOTE_OFF) ||<br>      (status_type == MIDI_NOTE_ON)){<br>    uint8_t status_ch = status;<br>    if ( data1&lt;split_note ) {<br>    	 status_ch = status_type | left_zone_ch;<br>    } else {<br>    	 status_ch = status_type | right_zone_ch;<br>    }<br>    MidiSend3(MIDI_DEVICE_DIN,0,status_ch,data1,data2);  	<br>  }<br>}</p>

<p>So it just sends the top half of the keyboard to Ch1, bottom half to Ch2. Any commands other than Notes keep their channel.</p>

<p>To some extent I can just work on the script do whatever want as regards octave shifts or whatever, but I'd like to make it configurable by midi Prog Ch for performance.</p>

<p>I read that the script obj is deprecated, and I want to be able to write to persistent variables.</p>

<p>So any pointers as to how to take the next step, which is presumably to move that code over to an object?</p>

<p>Where can I look at the functions and variables that will be in scope for the code in the objects?</p>

              <p>Hi!<br>(apologies, I could be missing a simple feature here?)</p>

<p>Is it possible to add a midi channel selector 1 to 16 (+omni?) in the right click &gt; Midi CC selection box?</p>

<p>It would be very useful!   </p>

<p>I use an Arturia Beatstep, 16 knob, 16 pad controller. The 16 knobs output midi CC's, which are assignable (but with a default <span class="hashtag">#cc</span> layout). Pressing Channel + Pad 1 to 16 changes the Midi Channel the notes &amp; <span class="hashtag">#CC</span>'s transmitted on. So its easy to work with 16x16#CC's, channel 1 to 16. giving more controls. It works like paged controls, allowing me to have all similar controls mapped per page.</p>

<p>I also use an akai MPC that transmits Midi CC, but it it best left on Channel 1, When making complex patches, it would be great to be able to specify the midi channel when assigning a CC to a knob so i can easily assign CC's on one channel to one control surface, or one "page"/channel on the beatstep.</p>

<p>I have tried many ways to acheive this, I built a sub-patch to receive 16 CC's and set the midi channel on the subpatch, then output into the main patch, per midi channel, but then you lose the visual feedback on the knobs (they move when directly mapped via the gui) - and, they respond differently (on endless rotary encoders, under usual, right click - CC mapping, they work in pickup - they move from the current position, the way i have it with the sub patch they jump to the current/last value)</p>

<p>or - is there a better way to do this?</p>

<p>thanks for any suggestions and help.</p>

<p>Daniel<br>(ps, i'm sorry if this isn't very clear, i'm finding it hard to explain)</p>

              <p>Can anyone point me to examples of patches that use the Release Velocity parameter well? </p>

<p>EDIT: Disregard what I had posted before. I have been experimenting all day and have a good grasp of how the Release Velocity values work now. I'm just struggling to implement it the way I imagine. I haven't found any example patches that actually use the parameter yet. I'm interested in looking at any implementation, but here is how I imagine using it:</p>

<p>Ultimately I want to use all the dimensions of my MPE controller (Linnstrument) to control the envelope of a patch. As for the envelope:<br>Pressure: Main control of volume<br>Velocity: Adds a transient if higher than Pressure<br>Release Velocity: Increases release time if the value is low. In other words, adds a tail if you let go slowly. </p>

<p>I've tried this numerous ways now. I was moderately successful by using math/max to combine a transient envelope (based on Velocity) with the Pressure value, then using another math/max to combine that with an ending tail envelope (based on Release Value). Unfortunately, in making the "ending tail" envelope I had a lot of trouble dealing with the note holding before the release. One solution I tried involved subtracting the gate so that it would be silent until the note is released. It was hard not to have a momentary silence or a transient when the gate was released. </p>

<p>I imagine the right envelope object could solve this, but I've been looking through everything in the library and I don't see one that would work quite right. I basically need something where I can limit the maximum value for the attack based on the Velocity, but the sustain can reach a higher value than the attack did, because the sustain would be modulated by the Pressure value. I don't want to multiply the envelope by the Velocity, because then the Pressure would be limited by the initial Velocity value. I want to be able to, on the lightest press, have no transient and just fade in based on Pressure. </p>

<p>Sorry, this is a long ramble. Mainly just hoping to see what others have done with Release Velocity, so I can come up with better ideas.</p>
