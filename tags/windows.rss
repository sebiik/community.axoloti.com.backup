              <p>I just tried installing Axoloti on a new Windows 10 machine. After installing the latest runtime and msi from 1.0.12-2 I found I could not launch the application. It popped up three dialogue boxes immediately:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Failed to find library.</p>
<p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Axoloti\runtime\bin\client\jvm.dll</p>
</blockquote>

<p>then</p>

<blockquote><p>Failed to locate JNI_CreateJavaVM</p></blockquote>

<p>then</p>

<blockquote><p>Failed to launch JVM</p></blockquote>

<p>Oddly the first file appeared to be there. I'm not very knowledgeable on Windows so perhaps I was missing something.</p>

<p>I've uninstalled that version and am using 1.0.11 which appears fine so far.</p>

              <p>Hello together,</p>

<p>First post here, but reading since I got my Axo in February -- I really like your community <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>I just setup a Windows 7 64 System on my Laptop, since some driver issues with other hardware didn't really work out under Linux (I'd prefer that, but well..). </p>

<p>So I happily saw release 1.0.12-2, downloaded and installed as usual;  <code>no matching PID/VID</code>. Bummer.</p>

<p>I read thoroughly existing threads with similar topics, but the suggested methods do not work. I can further rule out a faulty cable or faulty Axo, since both work on the linux partition of the very same machine without a hitch. </p>

<p>The actual problem:</p>

<p>Windows will recognize both Axo-Devices, but the axo-patcher still won't find the unit.</p>

<p>I tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>replacing the driver for Axo Bulk IF with Zadig (Zadigversion from Axo_Runtime and newer version from Website)<br>=&gt; no change. Substituting libusb-drivers works "for windows", since it will show in the device manager under "libusb**-devices", but still PID/VID-error in axo-patcher.</li>
<li>Installing the compatible drivers mentioned before (winusbcompat) for the Bulk IF<br>=&gt; no change. Recognized by windows as "WinUsb 1.0", but PID/VID-error in axo-patcher.</li>
<li>Booting to Flashrescue.<br>That one is interesting since it works as described <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/installing-on-windows/36">here</a> up to the point where the axo-patcher will not detect any DFU-device. (Windows recognizes the ST*-device and lets me change drivers accordingly.)</li>
<li>Booting with s2 held down to remove any sdcard-weirdness (I understood that this could help, but can't find the thread right now).</li>
</ul>

<p>I tried all of the above also with release 1.0.12 to no avail. </p>

<p>The laptop is a Lenovo Thinkpad (e535), the chipset from AMD; I removed the Lenovodrivers and let Windows-Update get its generic driver for the USB-Host, still nothing. </p>

<p>To me this reeks of a weird cornercase of driverfu**ckups under win, but I am out of my wits. Any of you guys got some idea? </p>

<p>Thanks &amp; Keep up the good work, <br>-alt</p>

              <p>I just received my Axoloti core today. I followed the instructions for a normal installation (<a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/installing-on-windows/36">http://community.axoloti.com/t/installing-on-windows/36</a>), including the instructions to have the runtime files copied to C:\Program Files (x86)\axoloti_runtime\platform_win. When I try to install the .msi file, when I get to the loading screen, I get an error message that says "The system cannot open the device or file specified." When that error message is closed, another message immediately pops up that says "The installer has encountered an unexpected error installing this package. This may indicate a problem with this package. The error code is 2755." I also tried to install the previous .msi file from Axoloti-1.0.12, and that doesn't fix the problem. I've tried searching the forums but was unable to find a solution.<br>I'm running a Lenovo Thinkpad Edge E520 with Windows 7 Professional, 64-bit. <br>Thanks!</p>

              <h1>Normal Installation</h1>

<p>To reduce size we split the application into two parts, the main axoloti application, and a runtime which contains other required files. You must download and install both initially. <br>(Usually updates will only require the main application to be downloaded and installed.)</p>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>download</strong> both <strong>application bundle</strong> and <strong>axoloti_runtime</strong><ul>
<li>go to <a href="http://github.com/axoloti/axoloti/releases">http://github.com/axoloti/axoloti/releases</a>, you will see the 'latest release'</li>
<li>download axo_runtime_win.(version).msi</li>
<li>download axoloti_win_(version).zip</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>install runtime zip</strong>:<ul>
<li>double click on zip file to unzip the file <br>on a 32bit windows system, this needs to be copied to:<br>C:\Program Files<br>on a 64 bit windows system, this needs to be copied to:<br>C:\Program Files (x86)</li>
<li>now check that you have  <strong>C:\Program Files\axoloti_runtime\platform_win</strong> or <br><strong>C:\Program Files (x86)\axoloti_runtime\platform_win</strong> as appropriate.</li>
<li>
<em>if</em> when unzipped you find a folder other than axoloti_runtime, then look into that folder for axoliti_runtime, it is axoloti_runtime that must be copied to Program Files. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>install axoloti application msi</strong>:<ul>
<li>double click on the MSI file</li>
<li>you may get a warning from windows about not trusting, this is due to it not being signed, you can safely ignore this, click on More Info, and then click on "Run Anyway"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Connect axoloti core board</strong>, this will start windows installing the necessary drivers (if they are not already installed), and create a device called "Axoloti Core"</li>
<li>
<strong>Run Axoloti</strong> application, you will find it in C:\Program Files  or C:\Program Files(x86) </li>
</ol>

<p>Thats it, your done!!</p>

<p>Happy patching</p>

<h2>Recommended Platform</h2>

<p>Axoloti runs on many platforms and variations, but we are only able to test on limited number of platforms, if you experience issues we recommend the following, as these are our test platforms.<br>- Windows 7, 8, 10<br>- Java 1.8  (can be downloaded from <a href="https://java.com/en/download/">https://java.com/en/download/</a>)</p>

<h2>Developer installation (from source)</h2>

<p>If you are a developer and would like to follow the most up to date developments, and perhaps contribute to Axoloti development you can install from the Axoloti github repo</p>

<ul>
<li>clone from github</li>
<li>run build.bat in platform_windows</li>
<li>run ./Axoloti.bat</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: to create the bundles you will need to install the Oracle Java 8 JDK</p>

<h2>Advanced installation (Rescue mode)</h2>

<p>Usually you can flash the firmware with Axoloti using the regular flashing method, which the above installation will handle.<br>However, there is a 'rescue mode' (aka DFU mode)  which can be used if the board appears to not respond to normal firmware flashing. This is a 'rare' situation, if you have an issue that requires it we will let you know.<br>(most users will not need this function!)</p>

<p>this 'rescue' mode, also called DFU, requires a different driver from the normal Axoloti driver,  unfortunately for windows, the driver installed by default (STM32 Bootloader) is not compatible, and we need to replace it with the generic WinUSB driver.</p>

<p>To do this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enter rescue mode, by powering down the board, press S1 and hold, and power up the board. The two LEDs stay off in this case.</li>
<li>Windows will then install the incompatible driver, wait for this to complete.</li>
<li>After, go to C:\Program Files (x86)\axoloti_runtime\platform_win and run Zadig (zadig_2.1.2.exe)</li>
<li>Initially, the Zadig window is blank </li>
<li>select  "Options &gt; List All Devices"</li>
<li>While the axoloti board is in DFU mode, it will be listed as STM32 BOOTLOADER in the dropdown menu -  select it.</li>
<li>You will see Driver : Stu* -&gt; WinUSB (v6.1.7600.16385 etc) and underneath, Replace Driver, press "Replace Driver", this will replace the STM driver with the WinUSB driver</li>
<li>Now Axoloti flash rescue mode will work.</li>
<li>You can check that this is mode is available by staying in DFU mode,  start the Axoloti UI, go to "Board&gt;Select Device...", it will say 'STM DFU' in the description, driver OK.  (also Flash (Rescue) will be enabled)</li>
</ul>
