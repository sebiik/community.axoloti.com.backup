              <p>I recently purchased a Linnstrument (what a great controller!) and made two sound engines for it. Here is a video showing it off.<br>The patches are now in the community library. Go to <code>File-&gt;Library-&gt;community-&gt;TSG-&gt;MPE</code> to try them out for yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Important note:</strong> Due to an issue with axolotis voice allocation in mpe subpatches, I use a modified version of the <code>midi/ctrl/mpe</code> object. This version resets the pitch bend to zero on each new note to avoid erratic tuning and weird sticking pitch bend troubles. This works fine as long as you have Linnstrument in its quantized mode - meaning that a note is quantized on an initial button press (of course bending works just fine).  The bug is about to be fixed and will most likely be included in the next firmware update, according to <a class="mention" href="/users/thetechnobear">@thetechnobear</a>. I will then remove this message and revert to the factory <code>midi/ctrl/mpe</code> object.</p>

              <p>Hey I just got this TouchMe MIDI controller that measures resistance rather than capacitance to send MIDI notes. I've been able to get it working on my laptop fine, but it doesn't work with the axo. I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations for it. Any help would be super appreciated. When I plug it in, this is what comes up in the log:</p>

<p>Here is a link for it: <a href="https://shop.playtronica.com/touchme" rel="nofollow noopener">https://shop.playtronica.com/touchme</a><br>It looks like it's sending power to the TouchMe, but it's not recognizing my touch on the main pads that send the notes.

              <p>Hello,</p>

<p>Is there anybody who can help me with following matter?</p>

<p>I want to control 2 of the knobs (e.g. volume and vibrato or reso, or other(s)) with the sensors (Volume and Pitch) on the left and right hand side of my Moog Theremini to control the by hand movements cq hand gestures.</p>

<p>According to Moog it is possible via CC2 (Volume) and CC20 (Pitch) to connect it to USB from Axocontrol.</p>

<p>I am using the patch Little Classic of (Thank you!) TIAR. </p>

<p>I do not know where i can do it. Does anybody know? </p>

<p>The Theremini is recognized  by Axoloti:</p>

<p>I know it is not possible to send note MIDI's to axocontrol, but maybe it is possible to use the Windows Axoloti software and use the keyboard within the program!</p>

<p>I tried to find a way, but me as a newbie I don't know where to start and to look a way to find the parameters and the way to match it with the CC Midi codes of the Theremini.</p>

<p>I sthere anyone who can and is willing to help me?</p>

<p>Greetings Peter</p>

              <p>I've rigged up a midi controller using a Teensy LC board today and it is capable of outputting cc signals via USB....unfortunately my USB input is currently occupied by my midi controller (Oxygen 49 MKIII) </p>

<p>I'm wondering if there are some pins on the board that I can solder an additional USB input to so I can connect my Teensy while my Oxygen controller is plugged into the main USB input....Also hoping this is possible so I can attach my Oxygen directly to the Axoloti and still have the usb accessible when I eventually throw them both into a custom enclosure.... </p>

<p>I'm also wondering if I could even just wire the Teensy directly to the board through rather than adding another USB....the Teensy can be powered using 3.3v off the Axoloti and I'm certain it can output its midi signals through a pin rather than through USB. </p>

<p>Here are some HD pictures of the Axoloti board...if anyone can point out where the USB/MIDI pins are ---- assuming the exist ---- I'd be very grateful and will have a really cool looking synth to show everyone soon!<br>          <a href="https://i.imgur.com/z2ZDj6j.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">

              <p>Hy guys,</p>

<p>it's about controlling more effects for my guitar using the same potentiometers. The idea is to control a parameter of one effect (f.e. a mix) with a potentiometer. When the rotary switch is on the second position the very same potentiometer should control a different parameter. In short: i wanna control more parameters with one single potentiometer.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Rotary on pos 1. &gt; Potentiometer is controlling Parameter 1 of effect 1<br>Rotary on pos 2. &gt; Potentiometer is controlling Parameter 1 of effect 2 ... and so on</p>

<p>I couldn't find any post which pushes me on the right way, so sorry if bothering: maybe on of you can give me an idea how to get the integer into changing the CC.</p>

<p>I've found very useful posts to get the rotary to an integer and to control the parameter with my poti. But how can i connect both concepts. Sorry, if this is maybe already solved an i'm to dumb to find it.</p>

<p>Thx for your help!</p>

<p>if you find a controller that does NOT work, then please <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/troubleshooting-usb-midi-controllers-not-listed-as-compatible-yet/217">read this topic</a>, and then <strong>raise a separate topic</strong> in this hardware category, so we can discuss the issue, and look for a resolution. please do not start a conversation here.</p>

<h1>USB Midi Device vs USB Midi Host</h1>

<p>Most hardware are either a midi device or a midi host, but Axoloti can be both, so its important to be clear on the distinction.</p>

<p>When using midi over USB, a piece of hardware takes on the role of either a <strong>host</strong> or a <strong>device</strong> for a single wired connection. <br>i.e. </p>

<pre><code>   USB Midi Host &lt;------&gt; USB Midi Device</code></pre>

<p>Obviously a 'dumb' midi controller (e.g. keyboard) is a USB midi device, this means when you connect it it needs to connect to something that can 'host' it. This might be a computer, or it might be a synth.</p>

<p>A computer is (generally) a USB midi host, since you connect midi controllers to it i.e. it hosts theses controllers.</p>

<p>Often USB midi hosts can host many USB midi devices at the same time, but generally a USB midi device is connected to one host</p>

<p>Axoloti , like some synths, can be both, if you connect via the micro usb port (the one you use to connect to a computer), it acts as usb midi device. if you connect it to something (e.g. a midi keyboard) via the full size usb port, then it will host other usb midi devices.<br>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>   Computer (host) &lt; -----&gt; (device) Axoloti (host) &lt;-------&gt; (device) usb keyboard</code></pre>

<p>It should be noted, generally both hosts and devices can send and receive data.</p>

<h1>Axoloti acting as a USB Midi Device</h1>

<p>If you connect to the Axoloti micro usb port, Axoloti presents itself as a class compliant midi <strong>device</strong>, and should be accessible on all class compliant hosts.</p>

<p>Capabilities: class compliant usb device, send/receive note, pitchbend, pressure and cc data.<br>Current limitations: no sysex support</p>

<p>Current tested hosts:<br>- Windows<br>- Mac OSX<br>- Linux (PC/VmWare/Raspberry PI 2)<br>- Axoloti Core<br>- iOS  (v8.3 (4s), v5 (iPad1), iPad 2) can be powered from iOS device </p>

<h1>Axoloti providing USB Midi Hosting</h1>

<p>If you connect a USB midi device into the Axoloti's full size USB port, Axoloti will act as a USB Midi <strong>host</strong></p>

<p>Capabilities: host for class compliant midi devices, can send and receive note, pitchbend, pressure and cc data.</p>

<p>Current limitations: <strong>No support for connecting via hubs</strong>, no sysex input support, sysex output only via api call.</p>

<p>Bus power: <strong>must not exceed 500mA</strong><br>(if you have issues with a device when using bus power, if the device permits, try using external power) </p>

              <p>I'm trying to create a subpatch that allows me to turn a row of 8 buttons on a MIDI controller (specifically for the Novation Launch Control XL, but the same could be applied to any amount of similar controllers) into shift/function buttons for 8 faders, effectively multiplying my amount of faders by 9 (unshifted + 8x with shift buttons). </p>

<p>I have managed to get this to work, relying heavily on the "rbrt/control/gate_hold" object, but there are two major problems:</p>

<p>1) while any of the shift buttons are pressed, the CC from the unshifted group is also sent. Is there a way to multiply/sum bools in such a way that the unshifted group is filtered out while any of the shift buttons are pressed?</p>

<p>2) when any of the shift buttons are pressed, the CC values of all 8 faders in that shift group are updated. I would want that only a fader that is moved while pressing shift is updated, not all of them. I've tried chaining 2 "rbrt/control/gate_hold" objects in series (one gated by the shift button, one gated by the trig output of the "midi/in/cc" objects of the individual faders), but this has no effect. How could I go about that?</p>

              <p>Hello this is my first post on this forum. I like the Axoloti very much. I use existing user patches (thanks!!) to get accustomed and to try to understand and or simply enjoy the great variety of sounds.</p>

<p>Attracted by the Orba Artiphon to use it as a midi controller for the Axoloti I bought one! I was especially interested in the simple design and the gestures possibilities  and midi options to use it as a mini keyboard e.g.</p>

<p>But i am not sure how to implement the MIDI connections. IN this case the Axoloti will be the host and the Orba the controller via USB. Axoloti recognizes the Orba, but it states "Mid class fail to init"</p>

<p>In fact, this is the complete message:<br>USB Device Attached<br>PID: 5740h<br>VID: 0h<br>Address (<span class="hashtag">#1</span>) assigned.<br>cfg desc: num interfaces 6<br>interface: interface 0, num 0, numep 0, class 1 , sub class 1<br>interface: interface 1, num 1, numep 0, class 1 , sub class 2<br>interface: interface 2, num 1, numep 2, class 1 , sub class 2<br>endpoint: interface 2, ep num 0, addr  3<br>endpoint: interface 2, ep num 1, addr  83<br>interface: interface 3, num 2, numep 1, class 2 , sub class 2<br>endpoint: interface 3, ep num 0, addr  82<br>interface: interface 4, num 3, numep 2, class A , sub class 0<br>endpoint: interface 4, ep num 0, addr  1<br>endpoint: interface 4, ep num 1, addr  81<br>interface: interface 5, num 4, numep 0, class 1 , sub class 1<br>Manufacturer : Artiphon<br>Product : Artiphon Orba<br>Serial Number : 357E34773039<br>Enumeration done.<br>Default configuration set.<br>MID class failed to init</p>

          <title>Help advise a total and complete beginner on how to build my enclosure!</title>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Warning: this post is long and is written by an incredibly ambitious and clueless person. </p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I made a preliminary post asking about the enclosure I wanted to build, in order to make sure that it was realistic. Luckily, the good people of this community informed me that it was. Since the post, my Axoloti Core has arrived in the mail and I need to stop playing with it for 2 seconds so I can build an enclosure for the thing! There's no real rush, apart from my excitement to materialize this idea.</p>

<p>So, for the build<br><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/1fda1c65f10390095baed5dc7a0f7f2a90dd0886" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1fda1c65f10390095baed5dc7a0f7f2a90dd0886.png" class="lightbox" title="Rough front Labeled Border.png"><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/1/1fda1c65f10390095baed5dc7a0f7f2a90dd0886_1_687x500.png" width="687" height="500"><div class="meta">
<span class="filename">Rough front Labeled Border.png</span><span class="informations">2475x1800 289 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>
</div></a></div></p>

<p>This is a very rough sketch of the general idea. By rough, I mean I found the axo schematic somewhere on this site and pasted it into photoshop, eyeballing the size. Not a final product. The faceplate will be 8.25" x 6" (need to get more familiar with the metric system before I start using the Synth Panels Designer extension!) The enclosure will be inside of a prebuilt box, so the size of the faceplate is fixed. The Axoloti will be visible out the front, but only the in/outputs will be visible.</p>

<p>I tried to correctly place the dimensions of the OLED w/breakout board, as well as the 4x4 button grid correct to Adafruit's specs. As for the pots, I could't find the size of pots anywhere, so each one is inside a 1"x 1" square while the actual circle sizes are completely arbitrary. The knobs will probably be much thinner. </p>

<p><strong>Now for the parts I need help with.</strong></p>

<p>I'm a beginner to electronics. I've used a soldering iron before, but consider this the project I'm "beginning" electronics with. In my previous post, I was informed that I might want to get a multiplexer, while someone else suggested I get a Teensy 4.1 which would do the job a multiplexer would and transmit the signal from analog to midi. I've decided to go with the Teensy. Other than 'it sends midi signals and connects via usb', I haven't got a clue how a Teensy works.</p>

<p>The following questions will illustrate that I need help with basically everything, but I understand that answering answering all these questions might take you forever, so I'm willing to consume any material (video, books) that will answer these questions also. Please just point me where to go! </p>

<p>The questions (imagine that I don't even know if I'm asking the questions properly):</p>

<ul>
<li>How do I connect a Teensy to an Axoloti?</li>
<li>Do I need anything, aside from wires, between the Teensy and the Axoloti?</li>
<li>Will I be using resistors, capacitors, or additional electronic components for this project?</li>
<li>How does the Axoloti know that it's receiving midi signals instead of analog?</li>
<li>Is the teensy capable of handling all 16 knobs as well as the button grid, button grid LEDs, and the OLED, or should I be using the in/out pins (is that even the right terminology?) on the axoloti, or do I need an additional board to make all these connections?</li>
<li>Can I mount the pots straight to an aluminum faceplate with the nut/is there anything I need to know about that?</li>
<li>How to wire pots together.</li>
<li>Actually, how to wire everything together.</li>
<li>Something about 3.3 volts that sounded important (yes, it's very important, please tell me about this)</li>
<li>Can I use the OLED as an oscilloscope without any additional hardware?</li>
</ul>

<p>Bonus question:<br>- I found 2 Adafruit 12x16 bit PWM boards on the ground out of nowhere, can I use these somehow? I know that PWM is used on analog synths, and that the Axoloti is digital so it won't do me any good there, but I don't know any more than that!</p>

<p>My current shopping list (please add if I need anything)<br>- At least 2 breadboards for testing<br>- 16 pots (I have the knobs)<br>- A whole bunch of wire (are there different types of wire I should be using?)<br>- 128x64 OLED display<br>- 4x4 silicone button pad, LEDs for it, board with buttons that goes under the pad. <br>- Teensy board (how do I connect it to Axoloti?)</p>

<p>Please feel free to tell me anything I'm missing, and if I've left it out of the questions/list, assume that I don't know that it exists. I'm not worrying about programming the OLED for now, it appears that there are plenty of resources on this forum for that. </p>

<p>If you've made it this far, thanks so much for your time! Doubly so if you're answering any of the questions. I'm excited for this project, and I'm hoping to make a video afterwards to show everyone here, as well as my friends to blow their mind about the Axoloti.</p>

<p>For anyone wanting to experiment here is the code in the github <a href="https://github.com/CarloCattano/MultiMidi_Axoloti" rel="nofollow noopener">GITHUB  CODE </a></p>

<p>1.<br>Now that Ive got what I need to run multiple controllers , I will try to experiment further into ableton link using puredata or a wrapper for python . Then small gates of 3.3v could be sent from the PI's GPIO's out to the axo and thats tempting to try for me , way easier and probably less messier than midi .</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There is a wonderfull library called Maximilian written in C++ for audio synthesis that performs really well in the pi , i might start to go deeper into the possibility of also using it as an extra audio source , now that is there.</p></li>
<li><p>Changed my mind and now I guess I will put the oled displays on the pi side of things . I will keep one on the axo for waveforms and meters but the rest could be easily transfered into the Pi and use some comunication from the patcher to talk to the callbacks</p></li>
</ol>

<p>**The code is still in proccess and its not meant to be ready to use for any case scenario , so you will have to add your controllers names on your own etc. Let me know here if you need some help with that .</p>

<p>I was wondering if there is a simple way to save presets away from the patcher?<br>I want to make a simple polyphonic 'analog' synthesizer and save different presets from the same patch, using a button connected to the axoloti.<br>This seems like a very obvious thing to want, so perhaps there is already a solution for this?</p>

              <p>Hi everyone!<br>Here's how to make a USB midi controller for dirt cheap! <br>This one has has a red breakoutboard that you can attach 16 analog potentiometers to.<br>The user <a class="mention" href="/u/smashedtransistors">@SmashedTransistors</a> reminded me that If you choose to utilize the remaining analog inputs on the Teensy then this project will end up adding up to <strong>27 inputs!!!</strong></p>

<p>what you'll need:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 Teensy LC ---&gt; <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensylc.html" rel="nofollow noopener">buy from pjrc</a> $11.65</li>
<li>1  CD74HC4067 breakout board ---&gt; <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9056" rel="nofollow noopener">buy from sparkfun</a> ($4.95)</li>
<li>1 to 16 10k linear B potentiometers. ---&gt; <a href="http://www.ebay.ca/itm/5pcs-B10K-10Kohm-Linear-Taper-Rotary-Potentiometer-Panel-Pot-/232421935652?hash=item361d6d4a24:g:YGMAAOSw0UNZdVR1" rel="nofollow noopener">buy from ebay</a> (5pc for $1.25)</li>
<li>1 Breadboard -----&gt; <a href="http://www.ebay.ca/itm/1PCS-Mini-Prototype-Solderless-Breadboard-400-Contacts-For-arduino-Raspberry-pi-/151909047511?hash=item235e7c1cd7:g:6AMAAOSw7FRWZlbJ" rel="nofollow noopener">buy from ebay</a> ($1.50)</li>
<li>Wire....pennies per ft! buy lots because its always handy to have lots of.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong><br>Once you have all these items wire them up together like this...for simplicity sake only 3 potentiometers are shown but you can connect 16, just remember to connect any additional pots to +/- and the center pins of the potentiometers go to the "C" pins on the red breakout board. <br>          <a href="https://i.imgur.com/i63aWzf.png" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/i63aWzf.png" width="690" height="446">
          </a>
</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong><br>Install Arduino 1.8.4 (newer versions don't support teensy LC yet <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> )<br>Get it here ---&gt;  <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases</a></p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong><br>Install the Teensy loader application <br>Get it here ---&gt; <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong><br>Plug your Teensy into your computer via usb...</p>

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong><br>Open Arduino 1.8.4 and click "tools" and then set the board type to Teensy LC<br>          <a href="https://i.imgur.com/mBqmiNm.png" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/mBqmiNm.png" width="690" height="395">
          </a>
</p>

<p><strong>Step 6:</strong><br>Click tools and also set the USB type to MIDI<br>          <a href="https://i.imgur.com/qLzFDnu.png" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/qLzFDnu.png" width="690" height="435">
          </a>
</p>

<p><strong>Step 7:</strong><br>Delete the "void setup" and "loop setup" code so you have a nice blank page in arduino. <br>          <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ViDcOmL.png" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">

<p>To set the CC values of the C0 pins on the red breakoutboard, change the values in the "const int CCID[MUX_PINS] = {70,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36};"  to whatever you want! left to right (70 to 36) are c0 to c15</p>

          </a>
<br>Wait a little while and allow the arduino software to verify and compile the code. </p>

<p><strong>Step 10:</strong><br>Once its done compiling, click "upload" <br>          <a href="https://i.imgur.com/twCl2Hg.png" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">

</p>

<p><strong>Step 11:</strong><br>Plug your fancy new DIY midi controller into the axoloti and enjoy!</p>

<p>Note: this USB midi controller is gunna take up your USB port..not ideal if you want to use a USB keyboard....I'll make another tutorial on how to hardwire one of these directly to the MIDI in pins once I figure it out...many people have attempted to help me so far but I'm pretty dense and haven't been able to get it to work yet....<img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=5" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:"></p>

              <p>Hi!<br>(apologies, I could be missing a simple feature here?)</p>

<p>Is it possible to add a midi channel selector 1 to 16 (+omni?) in the right click &gt; Midi CC selection box?</p>

<p>It would be very useful!   </p>

<p>I use an Arturia Beatstep, 16 knob, 16 pad controller. The 16 knobs output midi CC's, which are assignable (but with a default <span class="hashtag">#cc</span> layout). Pressing Channel + Pad 1 to 16 changes the Midi Channel the notes &amp; <span class="hashtag">#CC</span>'s transmitted on. So its easy to work with 16x16#CC's, channel 1 to 16. giving more controls. It works like paged controls, allowing me to have all similar controls mapped per page.</p>

<p>I also use an akai MPC that transmits Midi CC, but it it best left on Channel 1, When making complex patches, it would be great to be able to specify the midi channel when assigning a CC to a knob so i can easily assign CC's on one channel to one control surface, or one "page"/channel on the beatstep.</p>

<p>I have tried many ways to acheive this, I built a sub-patch to receive 16 CC's and set the midi channel on the subpatch, then output into the main patch, per midi channel, but then you lose the visual feedback on the knobs (they move when directly mapped via the gui) - and, they respond differently (on endless rotary encoders, under usual, right click - CC mapping, they work in pickup - they move from the current position, the way i have it with the sub patch they jump to the current/last value)</p>

<p>or - is there a better way to do this?</p>

<p>thanks for any suggestions and help.</p>

<blockquote><p> Also if you are working on something, tell us about it, perhaps others have a similar interest, perhaps even collaboration is possible.</p></blockquote>

<p>Will take that as an opportunity to introduce my pet project. No achievement yet, just exploring different approaches. So no berating me for failing to produce a proof of my amazing accomplishments. Just got my first Axo Core today.</p>

<p>My project/plan and reason to reach Axoloti-land is: building my very own digital wind instrument with all bells and whistles (but with more expressive sounds than ding-dong and wheeeeee). My musical background is as a sax player and ethnomusicologist. Which should give you an idea of what may be going on, here.</p>

<p>Been playing a fair bit with Raspberry Pi, Sonic Pi, and Pure Data with a bit of Processing, ChucK, SuperCollider, and iOS apps. Been having a whole lot of fun through “Digital Musicking” (i.e. the music part of Digital Making, building upon Gilbert Rouget and Christopher Small’s ideas on diverse types of musical participation). </p>

<p>Over twenty years ago, bought a Yamaha WX-11 Wind Controller. Unlike most Akai EWI models (and the new Roland AE-10 Aerophone), it only serves as a MIDI controller and produces no sound whatsoever. So my basic, almost pressing need is for a portable sound module of some kind. Got a TX81Z (rackmount FM synthesizer from the 1980s), but that’s not very convenient. Could use a laptop, smartphone, or tablet, but it’s the same basic issue. Would just like to add proper sounds to this device. Almost any kind of microcontroller or single-board computer could do the trick. Just a matter of creating a synth patch and driving it through MIDI.</p>

<p>An ear-opener is in using breath pressure (MIDI CC#2) to modulate a low-pass filter. Tried that with softsynths on both desktop and mobile devices. Makes things really expressive. Amazingly simple. So, having a small device which takes MIDI in and drives some kind of sawtooth wave changing pitch with MIDI notes (in legato mode), modulating a low-pass filter’s cutoff frequency through breath control would be fun.</p>

<p>But, obviously, my plans get much deeper.</p>

<p>One is to enable the “Michael Brecker Effect”, based on <a href="http://robbykilgore.com/?p=19" rel="nofollow noopener">the work done by Robby Kilgore with the well-known sax player</a> on the Oberheim Xpander. You send a MIDI note and the system gives you rotating chords to accompany this. As the sax is a monophonic instrument, it’s a real kick to have complex harmony coming out of playing a sax-like instrument.</p>

<p>Created similar harmonizing effects in Pure Data and Sonic Pi. Loads of fun to play. Also used mucoder’s no-cost tonespace standalone app and plugin to enable complex harmonies from single notes. And played with other approaches to harmonizing incoming notes. Lots of potential and, assuming Axo could do things like these, could be a significant part of the instrument.</p>

<p>Apart from harmonization affordances, my ideal digital wind instrument would be able to control sound in very expressive ways. Modulating a low-pass filter’s cutoff frequency through breath is a lot of fun already. But how about using some parts of your mouth to change timbre in significant ways? Existing wind controllers have some kind of lip/bite sensing, which typically translates to pitch bend (but can be assigned to other controls). But how about going deeper into the articulation mechanics of the mouth? Woodwind players already realize that a fair amount is happening in the mouth as we play. But once you start getting into articulatory phonetics, you realize that it gets deeper and more complicated, if not complex. Maybe it starts with a kind of (whispered) vocoding model or some sort of formant filter bank. But we can go further than a breath-enabled wah-wah pedal.</p>

<p>The other big dimension is about the synthesis model. Been dreaming of something which brings together wavetable, physical modeling, virtual analog (“modular”), additive, FM, and granular syntheses. Not all the same time, maybe. But flexibly going from one to the other and/or having affordances from a couple of them. My ideal instrument would produce sounds which haven’t necessarily existed before, yet don’t sound out of place in particular musical contexts.</p>

<p>So, there you go: my overall idea for building something with the Axoloti Core. Will certainly take quite a while to build something worthwhile. But it’s a fun journey.</p>

<p>Obviously, help would be greatly appreciated. This Axoloti thing really is new to me.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

              <p>Hello there, <br>in short: is there something like [midiin] [midiout] object in pure data for Axoloti???</p>

<p>I am looking for a Axoloti solution for what I can do with Pure Data:<br>I need to send a MIDI CC Value together with a MIDI Note so that it is interpretet by an instrument not as two successive messages, but as one. </p>

<p>In Pure Data I can, for example, send the Message<br>[176, 17, 12, 144, 64, 127] via the  [midiout] Object to an Octatrack and this means for that machine:<br>For the Audio Track listening on Midi Ch 1(=176) set the CC 17 to value 12, then trigger a midi note on midi channel 1 (=144) at the midi note number (=64) with veloity value (=127) </p>

<p>This makes the machine act like recieving the CC and MIDI Note (for triggering a sample) simultaniuously. </p>

<p>All I got to do was make Axoloti send out the CC value first, then the MIDI note... but it is always interpreted as two messages, following one after another. So First the CC changes Value, but the midi note triggered is still related to the old CC value...</p>

<p>Any ideas? If we get this working I can post a tutorial on how to use Axoloti to use  the Elektron Octatrack as an MPC like polyphonic sampler <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Hello there,</p>

<p>Thank you very much  for taking interest in this topic, my skills in Axoloti patching are plain bad. I was wondering if anyone has explored the possibillities for a real time vocal harmonizer (like this awesome <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnpVAyPjxDA" rel="nofollow noopener">Jacob Collier</a> stuff) as shown in the picture below (taken from <a href="http://forum.critterandguitari.com/t/vocal-harmonizer-collier-bon-iver/1108" rel="nofollow noopener">this post</a> on an Organelle forum). </p>

<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/1ea9c6b43ca211b56d50d50d4a280cb10fa11801" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1ea9c6b43ca211b56d50d50d4a280cb10fa11801.jpg" class="lightbox" title="a.jpg"><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/1/1ea9c6b43ca211b56d50d50d4a280cb10fa11801_1_407x500.jpg" width="407" height="500"><div class="meta">

</div></a></div></p>

<p>He uses a custom box built by MIT and specifys exactly what notes it harmonizes via midi controller. Sounds to me that he also has some vocoder effect added. Such a classy vibe.</p>

<p>Thanks guys</p>

<p>I've been meaning to get an Axoloti for quite some time now.<br>Not knowing what to box it in or what to make of it really I came across this thing whilst buying new furni for my new apartment, something about the likeness to old school drum machines and MPC's stuck with me.</p>

<p>I have some really wicked ideas but for the most part it's mostly to house it there and to make the buttons trigger different actions from the axoloti, humble beginnings.</p>

<p>Any ideas and inspiration is GREATLY appreciated. </p>

<p>Have a good day people!</p>
