              <h1>Overview</h1>

<p>This topic is intended to discuss USB midi controllers and their compatibility with Axoloti.</p>

<p>Please post here if you use a controller that works and is not listed here, and we will keep this post up to date.</p>

<p>if you find a controller that does NOT work, then please <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/troubleshooting-usb-midi-controllers-not-listed-as-compatible-yet/217">read this topic</a>, and then <strong>raise a separate topic</strong> in this hardware category, so we can discuss the issue, and look for a resolution. please do not start a conversation here.</p>

<h1>USB Midi Device vs USB Midi Host</h1>

<p>Most hardware are either a midi device or a midi host, but Axoloti can be both, so its important to be clear on the distinction.</p>

<p>When using midi over USB, a piece of hardware takes on the role of either a <strong>host</strong> or a <strong>device</strong> for a single wired connection. <br>i.e. </p>

<pre><code>   USB Midi Host &lt;------&gt; USB Midi Device</code></pre>

<p>Obviously a 'dumb' midi controller (e.g. keyboard) is a USB midi device, this means when you connect it it needs to connect to something that can 'host' it. This might be a computer, or it might be a synth.</p>

<p>A computer is (generally) a USB midi host, since you connect midi controllers to it i.e. it hosts theses controllers.</p>

<p>Often USB midi hosts can host many USB midi devices at the same time, but generally a USB midi device is connected to one host</p>

<p>Axoloti , like some synths, can be both, if you connect via the micro usb port (the one you use to connect to a computer), it acts as usb midi device. if you connect it to something (e.g. a midi keyboard) via the full size usb port, then it will host other usb midi devices.<br>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>   Computer (host) &lt; -----&gt; (device) Axoloti (host) &lt;-------&gt; (device) usb keyboard</code></pre>

<p>It should be noted, generally both hosts and devices can send and receive data.</p>

<h1>Axoloti acting as a USB Midi Device</h1>

<p>If you connect to the Axoloti micro usb port, Axoloti presents itself as a class compliant midi <strong>device</strong>, and should be accessible on all class compliant hosts.</p>

<p>Capabilities: class compliant usb device, send/receive note, pitchbend, pressure and cc data.<br>Current limitations: no sysex support</p>

<p>Current tested hosts:<br>- Windows<br>- Mac OSX<br>- Linux (PC/VmWare/Raspberry PI 2)<br>- Axoloti Core<br>- iOS  (v8.3 (4s), v5 (iPad1), iPad 2) can be powered from iOS device </p>

<h1>Axoloti providing USB Midi Hosting</h1>

<p>If you connect a USB midi device into the Axoloti's full size USB port, Axoloti will act as a USB Midi <strong>host</strong></p>

<p>Capabilities: host for class compliant midi devices, can send and receive note, pitchbend, pressure and cc data.</p>

<p>Current limitations: <strong>No support for connecting via hubs</strong>, no sysex input support, sysex output only via api call.</p>

<p>Bus power: <strong>must not exceed 500mA</strong><br>(if you have issues with a device when using bus power, if the device permits, try using external power) </p>

              <p>I was thinking of buying Korg nanokey Studio. Is it possible to use some kind of usb splitter to have it connected to 2 axolotis? So I can use keyboard for one, pads for another one, share knobs, and maybe use chaospad for both?</p>

              <p>I am unable to properly use a standard USB mouse. Both mice I have tested work on a Windows 7 laptop, but give two different errors.</p>

<p>The first mouse, when connected, shows this:</p>

<pre><code>USB Device Attached
PID: AE1h
VID: 2188h
Address (#1) assigned.
cfg desc: num interfaces 1
interface: interface 0, num 0, numep 1, class 3 , sub class 1
endpoint: interface 0, ep num 0, addr  81
Manufacturer : N/A
Product :  USB OPTICAL MOUSE
Serial Number : N/A
Enumeration done.
This device has only 1 configuration.
Default configuration set.
Switching to Interface (#0)
Class    : 3h
SubClass : 1h
Protocol : 2h
Mouse device found!
HID class started.</code></pre>

<p>However, when I try out a test script I get some odd outputs:</p>

<ol>
<li>The left click is permanently pressed and the right and middle buttons are never.</li>
<li>The Y value moves down if I move it up <em>or left</em> and up if I move it down <em>or right</em>.</li>
<li>The X value appears to move up if I move up and right at the same time, while holding down one of the three buttons.</li>
</ol>

<p>When the other mouse is connected, the axoloti just displays <code>USB Device Attached</code> and then doesn't print anything else. Also, the light under the mouse (which is optical) doesn't turn on.</p>

<p>The axoloti is connected directly to the laptop and has nothing else connected, other than the mouse. I also don't know whether this is a problem with the axoloti patcher, the mice or the axoloti core.</p>

<p>Please can someone explain how to fix the problem in the hardware, or fix the code in the software!</p>

              <p>Hi everyone!<br>I'm very new in this community, and just started to use and experience my Axoloti.<br>I'm french, musician but a beginner in this kind of stuff. I just know a little about synth and midi (basics).<br>So, here is my problem:<br>I have a M-Audio Oxygen 8v2, and i tried to connect it to my Axoloti via USB port. So, it did not work at all. I played on all the keys, but nothing. As this keyboard has also midi ports, i tried to connect with midi, and it worked! But, i need this port for my BCR 2000.<br>I did a factory reset on my Oxygen, tried an other time with USB, and it worked!<br>Some hours later, i tried again and same at the beginning, it did not work with usb, only with midi. <br>I did an other factory reset on the keyboard, and nothing changed.<br>If someone could help me, it would be great!<br>By advance, Thank you.</p>

          <title>Troubleshooting USB Midi Controllers - not listed as compatible (yet)</title>

              <p>a quick about what we need to know if you find a USB MIDI controller thats not working, or missing functions...</p>

<ul>
<li>Is is listed in the USB Midi Controllers thread, if its listed as working, then others have it working so it may be your setup.<br>(this thread is only about controllers we don't know about yet, but read on, it may still help you)</li>
<li>There is only support for USB class compliant midi devices, this thread is only about hosting such devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>some notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Its obviously impossible to test every controller, there are 1000's of them, so its a community effort, and helps to find someone else who also has the same controller to see if they have similar issues. Also it should be noted, many controllers have 'modes', some of which may need midi messages to be sent to the controller to activate.</li>
<li>most (not all!) modern midi devices with USB are class compliant, but this was not always the case, older hardware very often is not. IF you need to installed a driver on a computer to get it to work, it probably is not class compliant, so will <strong>not</strong> work with Axoloti.</li>
</ul>

<p>some basic info, about the USB hosting provided by Axoloti</p>

<p>USB devices can share a number of ports (as opposed to channels which are different), it then sends all messages as 4 bytes (yes, even 2 byte midi messages, and sysex are also split up), so if you get one message type, then this shows Axolotis hosting is working... its only in the Axoloti objects (e.g. midi/in/keyb) do we start splitting messages up.</p>

<p>This is why, Axoloti should (and does) just work with most controllers, as long as they follow the specification. </p>

<p>before we start:</p>

<ul>
<li>ensure your device is connected directly to axoloti NOT via a hub</li>
<li>please check you are using the latest firmware (etc) for the device.</li>
<li>if the device accepts external power, try with external power ... <strong>some</strong> devices draw too much current to be bus powered.</li>
<li>ensure your device is class compliant, so test on a computer *without any** manufactures device drivers loaded... if you need to load drivers, its likely not to be class compliant.</li>
<li>please test your patch with another midi controller (din/computer) first, or at least test with the demo patch first e.g. electic piano or organ ... it could be your patch is not setup correctly, which is <strong>much</strong> easier to fix.</li>
</ul>

<p>to be able to possibly help, we need more info:</p>

<ul>
<li>when axoloti starts,  it prints some details to the console when the USB devices attaches... please post this.</li>
<li>connect the usb device to a computer and get a midi dump (snooze midi monitor is good on OS X), we will need to see CC/Notes etc, and both directions if applicable</li>
<li>in the midi dump, can you see the messages on the same midi port (not channel) ?</li>
<li>when you use on the computer with other applications (e.g. daws) do you have to select any kind of driver/control script?</li>
<li>Its <strong>extremely helpful</strong> if you can post a link to the midi specification for your device, (not just the user guide, which may or may not have the info we need).</li>
</ul>

<p>one thing to look for, when axoloti starts, you will see it prints interfaces/end point information, in particular it prints the 'class and subclass' for each device <br>for a USB MIDI class compliant device, you should see:<br><strong>class = 0x00 (Audio class) , subclass = 0x03 (MIDI streaming)</strong><br>if your device doesn't have this, its unlikely its class compliant.</p>

<p>as mentioned, it may be your device needs some special midi messages sent to it to work correctly, if this is the case then you can write a patch to do this.or try to convince someone else to that has the device. (again, this has to be a community thing, as no-one has all controllers)</p>

<p>once you have all tested the above, and have collected the above information, please create a separate thread, in the hardware category, with the device in the title e.g. "abcs usb midi device not working"</p>
