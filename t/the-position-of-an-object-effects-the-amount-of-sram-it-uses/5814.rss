    <title>The position of an object effects the amount of SRAM it uses?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/the-position-of-an-object-effects-the-amount-of-sram-it-uses/5814</link>
    <description>I have a patch that I&#39;ve been optimizing for a few days now. It compiles/loads fine currently, but it is right on the edge of using all of the available SRAM as I remove knobs, etc. in an attempt to eke out as much functionality as possible.

So I move a CONST/i up to a different position in my patch and suddenly I&#39;m over the SRAM limit by 32 bytes. I move it back and the patch compiles fine.

Can someone explain this to me as well as best practices to mitigate SRAM usage as it relates to the position of objects in the patcher?</description>

<p>As it's pretty hard to predict the final optimized compiled byte code from the wysiwyg ui, it will be a matter of trial and error repositioning objects - unless you want to take the effort to dig down into the compiled code to see what's going on.</p>

<p>I could be remembering this incorrectly, but I seem to recall that "above" and "below" refer to where the top left pixel of the objects are located relative to each other, regardless of their left-right orientation. So if two objects are located side by side, and the top left pixel of the right hand one is slightly above the left hand one, it is considered to be 'above' it. But as I say this could be wrong, I can't remember how I arrived at that conclusion or if I read it somewhere.</p>

<p>i have even seen cases, where an upward connection decreased sram usage.</p>

<p>i have to say though that this is all with patches that are hitting the limit of sram. so maybe there is some "bug" when you are near the limit. but that is of course also the one case where it is really frustrating. you try to optimise the patch by removing gui stuff etc. and end up eating up more sram. <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

              <p>It's not completely random, but the order of the modules does affect the amount of SRAM used, because with a less ideal ordering of the modules, the patcher may need to add temporary variables to hold the values of the various signals.</p>

<p>Basically, the patcher puts the runtime code for all the objects after each other, which is decided by their graphical position in the patch, and then completes the connections between the inlets and outlets. The code is then run in a loop, one sample at a time (this is a simplification, because the Axoloti actually processes 16 samples (k-rate vs. s-rate) at a time, but for the purposes of this discussion this is not important).</p>

              <p>Thanks, hearing that it is "random" and expected behavior actually makes me feel a little better about everything. My takeaway is: Build your patches logically top-bottom/left-right and if you're hitting the SRAM limit, you might be able to jiggle the handle to get over the hump, but don't rely on it.</p>

              <p>it's "random"... if you hit the sram limit, moving objects around may help.</p>

<p>generally execution order is left to right and top to bottom. so try to avoid upwards connections and right to left connections.</p>

<p>that being said i have seen times when embedding a custom object reduced sram and times where it increased the usage. i removed GUI elements from objects that i did not need and sometimes sram usage increased...</p>

<blockquote><p>Is the const/i object above the object it's connected to?</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>I don't recall. I believe it was below both times, however both its horizontal position and vertical changed between the working patch and the overflow version.</p>

<p>After encountering this I purposely put the patch over the SRAM limit and then started to move objects around to see how much over the limit I would be with each movement. It definitely changed each time I moved something however I definitely couldn't predict how it would change. Sometimes it appeared as though I bought a couple hundred bytes by moving a group of objects vertically higher, but then if I tried to buy more free memory by moving up similar objects I would lose it all and then some.</p>

<p>Your comment about other weird quirks makes me question if this phase of "optimization" even bought me any memory at all as I deleted the object that put me over the limit, so for all I know that "reset" any gained resources.</p>

              <p>I'm not sure. Could it be an execution order thing? Is the const/i object above the object it's connected to?</p>

<p>I'm interested in answers to this because I've had some pretty weird things happen when the patch gets this big. Stuff like I've removed some unused inlets/parameters and it's lowered the sram usage, then done exactly the same thing in a second instance of the same object and the sram overflows. And I've also deleted objects and the sram overflows. How would deleting things use more sram?</p>

<p>I assume it's something I'm not understanding about the way the patch is compiled or processed.</p>

              <p>I have a patch that I've been optimizing for a few days now. It compiles/loads fine currently, but it is right on the edge of using all of the available SRAM as I remove knobs, etc. in an attempt to eke out as much functionality as possible.</p>

<p>So I move a CONST/i up to a different position in my patch and suddenly I'm over the SRAM limit by 32 bytes. I move it back and the patch compiles fine.</p>

<p>Can someone explain this to me as well as best practices to mitigate SRAM usage as it relates to the position of objects in the patcher?</p>
