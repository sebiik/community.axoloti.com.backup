    <title>Is a TDM input on Axoloti possible?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/is-a-tdm-input-on-axoloti-possible/3943</link>
    <description>I&#39;m designing a system with 8 microphones coming through a TDM codec into a DSP with 2 analog outputs. 

I see that Axoloti&#39;s STM32F427 should be able to receive this through its SAI port. However I cannot seem to find whether or not the SAI port is free in some way, or if it is in use. 

And even  if I could somehow get access to the SAI port, it would mean I would have to write my own TDM object right?</description>
