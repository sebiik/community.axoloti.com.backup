    <title>Axoloti not powering on</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/axoloti-not-powering-on/1556</link>
    <description>Hello, fellow Axoloti Community.

I received my Axoloti yesterday and installed all the necessary drivers and software. I booted it up and played with all the demo patches and started learning how to make my own. That was last night. This morning I came in and everything was just as it was. I plugged in the USB cable and noticed that the red/green led lights did not come on. I tried powering the board with a different power source but it still not turning on. 
I tried to figure out how to troubleshoot this on my own by looking through the manual and the help guides and doing a search through the forum. I&#39;m pretty new so I may have missed it. I would appreciate anyone&#39;s assistance with troubleshooting this issue further.

Sincerely yours --</description>

              <p>I think that explains it. I think I had a bad usb hub which I've fixed. I was also screwing around with getting it running on an old netbook with windows xp and it wanted me to flash the rom when I plugged it in the first time? So I let it do it and I think that's when my usb hub shorted out the connection.</p>

              <p>That's good news!<br>The common cause for symptom you've observed (no red/green leds flashing during powerup) is unplugging the board while firmware flashing is in progress. <br>I don't understand what would have caused this between last night and this morning, if this happens again without apparent cause, please give a shout.</p>
