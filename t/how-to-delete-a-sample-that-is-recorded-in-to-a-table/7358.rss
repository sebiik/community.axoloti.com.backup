    <description>Hey! Is there a way how I can delete a sample that is recorded in to a table? I am using the table/record, table/play and the table/alloc 16b sdram objects.</description>

              <p>i think this might be a great chance for you to dive a tiny little bit deeper into axoloti programming. it is really easy to create a new object that references the table and has, let's say a trigger input.</p>

<p>then you just need to write a very simple loop that starts running on an incoming trigger signal, iterates through the table and sets every value to 0. it's really not complicated and will be instant as opposed to your 1.5sec workaround.</p>

<p>i haven't opened axoloti patcher in months so i am not sure about the syntax, but it would roughly be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>if (input.trigger &gt; 0) {
   for (i=0; i&lt; size(this.table); i++){
      this.table[i]=0;
}
}</code></pre>

<p>the table reference syntax is definately a bit different, also i just made up the <em>size</em> function. but trust me, you'll get there within 10minutes and will have learned a lot.</p>

<p>But you could save a table with zeroes on your SD card and then use <strong>table/load</strong> to clear the current value of the table.</p>
