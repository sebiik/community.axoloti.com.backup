<p>The digital inter axoloti connection allows for 4 audio streams in both directions, I think <a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> said you could compress up to 16 k rate signals into one audio stream.</p>

Some more techy details:   The processor on the Axoloti Core allows up to 22.5 Mbit/s both sending and receiving. A single digital audio channel at 48kHz/32bit takes 1.536 kbit/s, so that 'd allow 8 channels of digital audio in both directions plus more control rate channels. If there is a less speedy processor connected (Axoloti Control - in development), that 'd be ma…</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>iirc, the plan is for it to carry audio, and midi data over the streams, as well as data for axoloti control.(but this is subject to change)</p>

<p>I sort of give some "support". Sometimes people just give up in the first steps because of installation and driver issues. Windows is not always friendly when you have to sort these kind of troubles.</p>

<p>Maybe it would be a good idea to translate the installation instructions into native languages.<br>For example, most french people have a very limited level in English.</p>

<p>Yes I tro also to give support. But if you are not really familiar with the concept of modulars, it  is a really hard job to learn</p>

<p>I remember when I first got it at the crowdfunding campaign. It was hard times, even coming from G2, which has a fairly similar interface and fairly similar object span. But I am really glad that I stuck with it. I havent really touched most of my studio since I got Axoloti, and that Includes, G2, Virus Redback, Micro Q Blofeld, Kp3, Some tc effects... Axoloti is the most fun of them all <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>Many synth addicts are not really into modular stuff, they just want some fixed architecture synths... to recreate some classic sounds.<br>Yesterday, i went to a music store to buy a QuNexus and to try these Yamaha and Roland pseudo vintage mini synths. <br>Well, the Axoloti can do better than these.</p>

<p>I think that the increasing number of patches in the community library is a plus for these potential users. <br>That's why i think the  <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/general-midi-collaborative-library/2545">General Midi collaborative library</a> is a good idea.</p>

<p>Combined with the new Patch Bank facility, it is really easy to make a "preset oriented" mini synth based on the Axoloti (+ Axo Control).</p>

<p>So a musician : with a nerd friend can benefit from the Axoloti</p>

<blockquote><p>Yesterday, i went to a music store to buy a QuNexus and to try these Yamaha and Roland pseudo vintage mini synths.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>I know sirsicksik just bought one QuNeo yesterday. All their products looks super nice <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I got a simple novation launch controller. I jjst need it for some knos and so on, but I couls use on with some better feedback, like a display or so..</p>

<p>to me it is about fleixiblity. In a regular synth if it even has got one, the combfilter are always placed before the amp envelope. I like it after the envelope. And so many small thing you cant do with a regular synth. When I sit with a regular synth I only see the limitations these days. Sure, Virus Redback sounds bloody good, but if it doesnt have the features, it doesnt have the features.</p>

<p>Euro Rack; I got 2 kids who also needs things. Euro rack is just to expensive to get started. TO have something nice with a few oscialltors envelopes and an effect or two you easily pass 1000 euro... SO for me Axoloti is perfect. If you put in the time and effort you can get super results, even with a low budget. ANd I prefer ANYDAY to support a small one man army, like Johannes, than to support some multinational companies, who only think abut € &amp; $. Axoloti is also about just helping each other without money is involved. Being friendly and nice and having a community about a common interest.</p>

<p>General midi library yeah. Fun thing. For me personally Axoloti is about all the things I cant make with other synths. And General midi library comes in abundens. Havent really checked any of the patches yet, but some of the "camp fire" and 70s rock band emulations sounds REALLY funny <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

</blockquote></aside>

<p>Yes true. </p>

<p>I really like the sample/wavetable side of axoloti. That was the first thing to explore. Id love to see some spectral synthesis of some sort in Axoloti. That would really open up for some new things on the sampling side. Or a phase vocoder... Oh.. Just hit me... Doesnt one of the new mutable things actually have phase vocoder? I know one of their Eurorack modules have got phase vocoder. I wonder if <a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> also has ported over that one? </p>

<p>Guess this is something that is worth looking into........ if we can take phase vocoder form one of the MI objects, and use it for sampling...</p>

        <p>About poly modulation: One nowadays often talks about the axis on which pressure is applied. The X,Y and Z axis are then mentioned. One can compare it to lying a mathematical graph on top of oyur keyboard. X is from left to right, Y from front to back ) and Z for down and up (how hard you press). Using three axis polyphionically in real time will however be a challenge to 99 % of us players, especially on somehting as tiny as the Qnexus. I use a lot of poly aftertouch, so basiclly Y-axis, plus a bit of monophonic ribbon (so x-axis). Doing that right polyphonically does already produce a lot of stuff for the listener to keep track of. So polyphonic multiaxis real time use (what a mouthfull!) becomes more relevant when one wants to play complex arrangements live on one controller. With multitracking it is luckily less relevant. A form of poly expression is however always great addition to a setup.</p>

<p>In the mean time: Still waiting for those new Axoloti's. Dumdidumdidum.</p>

<p>Well, I'm sure Johannes also has other things to do. A sort of, non binding upfront prediction of when the next batch wil become available would however be nice.</p>

        <p>I've had a couple of PMs asking me about dates, as Ive said, I don't know,  but, I did ping'd  Johannes, and he told me he is "working on a date, expect 2 weeks."<br>obviously, treat this as an unofficial, rough date, subject to change... but perhaps useful to have a 'rough idea'</p>

<p>im guessing he is waiting for a 3rd party to commit to a date, before he knows when he can deliver... im sure he will post here once he knows.</p>

<p>The big picture does look good, seems like the word is getting out, and also existing users are wanting multiple boards as they find different uses for axo.</p>

Using three axis polyphionically in real time will however be a challenge to 99 % of us players, especially on somehting as tiny as the Qnexus. I use a lot of poly aftertouch, so basiclly Y-axis, plus a bit of monophonic ribbon (so x-axis). Doing that right polyphonically does already produce a lot of stuff for the listener to keep track of.
