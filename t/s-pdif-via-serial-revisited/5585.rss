    <title>S/PDIF via serial revisited?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/s-pdif-via-serial-revisited/5585</link>
    <description>Hey i read the threads with at least a few tidbits of info on digital audio/interfacing several AXOs. And looking at the STM32F and what @johannes said about it, it seems like our beloved microchip is totally capable of native S/pdif i/o handling. see this application note https://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/application_note/group0/c5/67/84/35/7e/4c/4c/19/DM00431633/files/DM00431633.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00431633.pdf 

i am still digging into this totally overwhelming pdf but was wondering if maybe in the meantime anybody else took some endeavours in this direction? how would i even start about it, any pointers? do i have to route the output of those STM functions to one of the digital/serial i/o&#39;s ? probably open a serial connection, then write a script that call teh s/pdif functions? man i realize am in way too deep. no clue whati&#39;m even saying. if anybody is desperate for a developing job, i have some money to spend haha.</description>

<p>edit. nevermind i found it <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/crazy_face.png?v=5" title=":crazy_face:" class="emoji" alt=":crazy_face:"></p>

              <p>Look at the experimental Axoloti firmware on Github- youâ€™ll see the SPI code.</p>

<p>Sending data between Axoloti is easy. Trying to do it at sustained audio rates, without glitches, probably not easy.</p>
