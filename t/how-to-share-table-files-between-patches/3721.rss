    <title>How to share table files between patches?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/how-to-share-table-files-between-patches/3721</link>
    <description>How can I save a table to a file in one patch and open it in another?
The problem I&#39;ve been running into is that table/load and table/save seem to restrict the file locations to the directory of the patch; preventing me from accessing those tables in another project.

I&#39;m building an instrument similar to the &quot;Modulin&quot; built by wintergatan (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFfe4ZRQOH8) and I need to calibrate my ribbon; but I&#39;d like to not have to do that every time I load a new project; instead have one patch dedicated to calibration (which is a 5 minute process to get the values for the calibration table) and then have all other patches read the table it created.

This image shows an example of my problem. In the string, I never specified it to be in 0:/untitled/ but it put it there anyway. Is there a way to circumvent this, and have it access 0:/oijjioijojiouhio instead of 0:/untitled/oijjioijojiouhio?

(oijjioijojiouhio is a random keyboard-smash name; its not specifically important)</description>
