    <title>Patch Launch Control Led with logic counter</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/patch-launch-control-led-with-logic-counter/2446</link>
    <description>
Hello, 

I did this patch,  to use each pad of the launch controle of novation with an logic counter and different led color for each tree positions. 
I was working empirical, so i guess there is miskate, or we can improve it. 


The led color, is set with the value. 

The speed of the blinking led is set with  lfo, i did that because i will use it to know the speed of osc or lfo in my patch. But the true is : i didn&#39;t find the right way to keep it alway one. :sunny: 

Anyway, with this patch you have the number and the value of each note, to use the pad launch controle, with the original set up. 

Edit  this patch &quot; ring buffer overflow the midi send&quot;, you should change  &quot;usb host port 1&quot; to &quot;usb host port 2 &quot;

              <p>ok, the control lines (blue) are updating objects at 'control rate' which is 3000/sec</p>

<p>I think probably the cause of your issue is you are continually sending midi notes out, to update the pad , at a rate derived by your LFOs. this is completely unnecessary... and a waste of CPU too.<br>remove the LFO's and instead place a change from the mux output to the trig<br>e.g. <br>mux -&gt; change -&gt;note/trig</p>

<p>this will mean a midi message will only be sent when the colour actually changes, rather than continually updating.</p>

<p>generally, its important for any computing platform, but especially when using micro-controllers, that you minimise I/O as this is very 'expensive'. so if your doing midi output or gpio output , carefully triggering objects when needed is important.<br>(change speedlim can sometimes be used to throttle changes too, though in this case i dont think it necessary)</p>

<p>as a coding tip, Id also point out, you could also do what your doing with many fewer objects, all those repeated dials, lfo (unnecessary now) , midi/out/note,counters all take up valuable space, and could be replaced generally with a single one.<br>this is not an issue in this case, as the patch doesn't do much, but if you start incorporating with other functionality (e.g. doing FX/Synth) then it will limit that functionality.</p>

              <p>you are sending messages faster than can be processed...</p>

<p>this can happen in two scenarios:<br>a) your hardware device is not processing the messages (or too slowly) <br>b) you are trying to send too many messages in one go (k-rate cycle) </p>

<p>I found with the push, that when I made coding errors (a) was the most likely ... e.g. sending on the wrong usb port, or for some reason the push not being connected properly<br>... I suspect this is the case, as the ring buffer is pretty 'large' certainly more than 5 midi messages... so id guess, there is a build up of messages caused by something else.</p>

<p>on the push, I also was careful to not send too many messages in one k-rate cycle instead spreading the updates over a few.</p>

<p>I suspect what you are doing with the launch control is very similar to what I did with the Push, (see my community library objets) , so it might be worth you reviewing my code to see the things Ive done.... you may even be able to use some of it (e.g. to get scales support)</p>

<p>tech note: <br>patches send the messages in the normal 'audio thread', obviously we cannot block this with IO, so message are place in a ring buffer, than is then process by a separate midi IO thread. <br>this error occurs, when you are producing messages faster than the IO thread can consume them.<br>as I mentioned above, if you produce a huge number of messages quickly its possible to overflow, in practice, I found this uncommon, unless my code had gone a bit 'awry' , or a more general issue with usb output.</p>

              <p>Awesome man. Just bought a launch controller a while ago and I was wondering how to set those LEDs up.</p>

<p>Look forward to test it when I am home in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Allthough I think it is a lot of objects used for such a small task. Like the Modular thing controller patch I have made, it also uses alot of object for a fairly simple task; controlling something. I guess some custom objects would scale it down a bit. Will see it it is possible to do something about it. </p>
