    <description>#Overview
Errors that might occur when you take a patch live, you will see a RED error message at the bottom:
Compiling patch failed (~Documents/axoloti/mypatches/test.axp ) 

If you then look a few lines up, will see the cause of the error, listed before are the common ones and how to resolve.

#Errors
##CCMSRAM overflowed by 85792 bytes
The Axoloti board has a finite amount of memory (like us all) called SRAM. If you compile a patch that uses too much, it will give the above error (number will be different).
This is caused by allocating too much space for things like delay lines/tables.
FIX: reduce delay line/table sizes and try again, or move them to SDRAM of which there is much more!
(you will find sdram variants of most  write objects)

##sdram overflowed by 971520 bytes
Like above, the Axoloti has a finite amount of SDRAM (though much more than SRAM), if you compile a patch that uses too much it will give the above error (number will be different)
This is caused by allocating too much space for things like delay lines/tables.
FIX: reduce delay line/table sizes and try again.

##Finding the origin of other compilation errors
Often the error message will point out which object is causing the compilation error. Here is how to recognize this:

    In member function void rootc::instanceread__1::dsp(int32_t, int32_t (&amp;)[16], int):
    C:\Users\jtaelman\Documents\axoloti/build/xpatch.cpp:54:29: error: class rootc has no member named instancesdfdsafd_i

This error points to an object with instance name &quot;read_1&quot;. In this particular case it refers to a non-existing object.</description>
