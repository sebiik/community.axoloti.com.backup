    <title>Axoloti won&#39;t power up</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/axoloti-wont-power-up/5618</link>
    <description>Hello there !

I&#39;m creating a little synth with my friends and we did soldering for some controls. When I connect it to my computer, nothing happens and the leds are not lighting on. The axoloti is getting hotter and hotter, the more I keep it connected. So I was wondering if you know what we did wrong ? Is it a common thing in the community ?</description>

              <p>I solder some potentiometers, variable resistor, pressure pads, LED and switches. I solder them on a pcb board and I set the vdda into the pcb, so the electricity of the axoloti is going into the components and all the returns of the components are going into a PA, a PB or a PC. All the components are getting the same ground. I’m going to try to de-solder the components one by one to see what’s wrong. For the heating problem, the heat is coming from the center of the axoloti.</p>

              <p>Hello, what did you solder and where? What component of Axoloti is getting hotter? If you de-solder, does it work as normal?</p>
