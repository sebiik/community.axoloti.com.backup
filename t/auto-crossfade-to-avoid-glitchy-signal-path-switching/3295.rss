    <title>Auto-crossfade to avoid glitchy signal-path switching?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/auto-crossfade-to-avoid-glitchy-signal-path-switching/3295</link>
    <description>It&#39;s been super useful getting ideas from this forum to help me overcome all my initial sticking points as a new Axoloti user.  So, here goes again (and someday I will know enough to pay it forward).

I have two signal paths with different audio effects and I am using some logic in the patch to switch between them.  As you might expect, you can hear the switching, although it&#39;s actually less noticeable than I thought it would be.  

It seems like maybe one way to smooth out the glitchiness would be to have a triggered automatic crossfade from one path to another.  So, a toggled trigger delivering 1 causes a fade from signal path A to path B, and a trigger delivering 0 causes a fade from path B to path A.   

It seems like the component pieces to make this happen probably exist somewhere but I can&#39;t figure it out yet.  I can find the xfade objects but can&#39;t find anything that I can use for a controllable but automatic ramp from 0 to 1 or vice versa.  

Any ideas?</description>

              <p>Haha... I just saw this as I was posting the other reply.  Thanks for the suggestion and I might go back and give it a try.  The patch is seriously cluttered up with a lot of logic that seems unnecessary, using the envelope.  Maybe slew would be simpler/cleaner... thank you!!</p>

              <p>Aha, yes, thank you!  That worked.  It took about an hour of messing around to figure out how to get the rescaling and inversions right.  I had to convert the envelope ramps (running from 64 to 0) so that one goes -64 to +64 and the other does the reverse.  But it sounds a lot better... totally validating the concept.  Yay!</p>

<p>I have succesfully used an envelope to do something like you want to achieve(If I remember correctly, the envelope should be inverted, not 100% sure about this, depends on which input you connect you signal to in the crossfader). </p>

<p>The cool thing about using an envelope is that you can make a very smooth transition, even let it crossfade/fade out over a few seconds. This is cool if you are using larger reverbs.</p>
