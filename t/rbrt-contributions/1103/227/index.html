        <p>...basically,it just defines which area of the table you record into,or a recording offset.<br>for example,if you set the attribute 'slots' to '8' , the table is divided into 8 slots.<br>then,you can select via inlet 'slot' which area of the table you want to record to.</p>

<p>technically,you could also use 8 instances of 'lrec' with 'slots' set to '1' and record into 8 different tables,<br>but using 'slots' greatly simplifies patching and it's a lot more efficient.</p>

    Hi all, I have a patch idea where I record the audio input to SDRAM, but only when a key is held down. If you press a new key, recording resumes. If you press an old key, the portion of audio that was recorded for that key is played back. The problem is, none of the delay objects have any trigger inputs. Is there some community object that will let me do this?

<p>this should be doable... though remind that you are limited to the buffer in the time that you can record. So, for example, what should happen when you go over the available amount of buffer?</p>

<p>But this gives me an idea... a recorder that can either record to a selected midi-note (any value between 0 and 127) and a mode that would play a selected buffer, pitch-shifted by the midi note. Though, then again, this will be bound to be very short hi-res recordings if you want 128 samples.. or do it in 8 bit and have a low quality, but long recording time...</p>

        <p>Do you really need the "endpoint"? Isn't the endpoint the same minus one as the starting point of the next sample? Saves you 1 32bit value for each sample.

<p>yeah,it's possible,but it's easy to get confusing for others who want to write objects that use the sample start/end info created by 'sb rec'</p>

<p>what I think makes sense is to get rid of the 'active'-info by using 'endpoint' as a boolean instead:if 'endpoint' is true,this automatically means the 'slot' is active.<br>so,this would compact the size of the array used internally to 256 32-bit-values</p>

<p>I'm going to check...</p>

<p>From this I understand that you record the audio-samples one after the other in the same table and save the sample-slot next to it in it's own table to be able to tell which sample belongs to which index of sample-slot. Then you should be able to use that table to see what the starting position is of the next sample in line, no matter what slot in belongs to..right?</p>

        <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="/u/rbrt">@rbrt</a> <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>Have been using your object "rbrt/launchpad/launchpad" in to communicate<br>between Axoloti and Launchpad. Very nice object <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>It works very well when using it as the only midi device connected to Axoloti via USB Host port. </p>

<p>But I noticed yesterday I tried to connect a second midi device, a Launch Controller(via computer) to Axoloti,  that there might be some midi crosstalk going on in the  object. </p>

<p>It seems like the top row buttons, midi cc 104-112, are affected by any other incoming midi CC values that is fed to axoloti. For example if I set the top row to nr 5, and then touch one of the knobs on my Launch controller, the top row is affected and jumps to value 0.</p>

<p>And it doesnt matter which midi channel i send midi cc's from midi channel 1, 2, 3 they all seem to affect the top row.</p>

<p>Would you have a suggestion for a workaround this?</p>

<p>Thanks for some great objects, btw <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

        <p>...ah uh nasty.</p>

<p>actually, I never tried the object in a midi-setup that incorporates more than a single launchpad..<br>and the code regading midi in is taken from someone else's object,<br>so it's quite possible that this is a bug.</p>

<p>I'll have a look as soon as I get my hands back on the axo!</p>

<p>Thanks, I actually think I figured out what the problem is. It happens cause, the top out shows the midi cc number that is last dialed in.... So If I dial a knob on my Launch controller, the rbrt/launchpad/launchpad in "catches" the midi cc number from the dial from Launch Controller ad changes the output of the "top" row. Not really sure how to fix it though. I am thinking about maybe adding some kind of minimum/maximum value so it cant go out of range. But it would probably be more of a work around than a fix.</p>

<p>I have previously had succes with passing data through a table first, before sending it to its destination. Think I'll try that too for this setup.</p>

        <p>hi there!<br>I think that sharing my patch at this point would be fairly useless, because there a lot going on unrelated to loop but mixed in the patching(highly human unreadable), I used the old <a class="mention" href="/u/rbrt">@rbrt</a> loopers and it relies specifically on the hardware I use to control it... and the final version by the way has syncing only per board...<br>If you want I can offer the little knowledge I retained after doing it and help you a little if I can.<br>Upper in the thread I posted a trivial looper that can sync to a clock.<br>I remember it was very easy to make a midi clock from the range output of lrec.<br>You should definitely implement yourself a way that fits your needs to sync the start/stop between boards.</p>

        <p>you reckon it's possible to set the clock with the length of the first loop (fist 2 taps), and sync every other loop module across the 2 boards to that clock? I was thinking on doing this by connecting via both MIDI IN and MIDI OUT on the 2 boards, so that any of the 4 modules can be the "master loop"</p>

<p>also, does your looper sync the recording and playback of a new loop with the first bar of the master loop?</p>

<p>I have read a lot about patches and everything else in the site, but I still haven't tried anything because the 2 boards I ordered have been delayed. I'm also working on a deadline (university project) so I'm gathering as much info as possible before actually doing anything.</p>

<p>From what you guys have discussed here, I'm pretty sure all of this is possible, but I'd just like to confirm since my interpretations of the technical terminology might be wrong.</p>

<p>thanks for the reply!</p>

<p>Yes indeed. That's what I did for a while but my needs were different. My opinion is that this approach works best if you preset the loops relative lengths, like track1 is 4 bars, t2 is 8, and so on... and of course you always play 4/4, otherwise you'll have to set different math for different time signature. (that's why I changed to a different system, which won't be syncable between boards unless SPlink gets finally developed...)</p>

<p>(mind that I always used <a class="mention" href="/u/rbrt">@rbrt</a> old loopers, never the new ones which may be different and, probably, better) <br>I actually wasn't able to do that, but maybe it was me... I had a track that was always the master. When you record a loop the object lrec spits out the number of samples the loop is long. Divide that integer number for the number of bars, multiply it by 24, feed it to s2f (sample to frequency) and use the output as the frequency of a square wave oscillator. Et voilà your clock. Use something like the patch i posted somewhere up in the thread as a slave track.</p>

<p>Yes! My method use position sync and <a class="mention" href="/u/rbrt">@rbrt</a> loop_sync, but it will also work with clock sync ( I don't have the patcher installed on the pc I'm using right now, that's why I'm typing so much instead of uploading a   patch...)</p>

<blockquote><p>From what you guys have discussed here, I'm pretty sure all of this is possible, but I'd just like to confirm since my interpretations of the technical terminology might be wrong.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>I'm pretty sure you'll be alright... for me the hardest part (which I suggest you think thoroughly before starting) is the logic underneath how you want it to work I.E: you're allowed to record only one track at the time or not? If so, if you are recording loop1 and press record for loop2, what do you want to happen? (like, 1 starts looping and 2 starts recording, loop1 is recorded but stops... all this kind of options... this took me some time to be refined to my needs, but I actually make a living as a livelooping musician, so I'm quite picky about it <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> )</p>

        <p>I have most of the functions planned but I had not thought about starting REC while another loop is already recording! I'll go through every possible escenario and figure those details out.</p>

<p>thanks for the clear explanations!</p>

<p>on a side note, could you share a video of one of your performances (if you have any)? I'd like to see your show and how an axoloti-based looper behaves in a live setting.</p>

<p>cheers!</p>
