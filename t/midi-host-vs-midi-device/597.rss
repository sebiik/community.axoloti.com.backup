    <title>MIDI Host vs MIDI device?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/midi-host-vs-midi-device/597</link>
    <description>Hello,

I just scored an Axoloti on the used market (whooo !) And I have a question regarding MIDI.

I&#39;d like to use the Axoloti as a MIDI step sequencer with my Linnstrument as the front-end.
The Linnstrument would be connected via USB to the host port, the Axoloti would then control lights of the Linnstrument.  I was then wondering if I could connect the Axoloti using the normal device port to a computer (or another usb midi host) to send the MIDI too ?
Basically, is it possible to use Host MIDI and device MIDI independently ?

Thanks !</description>

<p>yes... but the idea is that <strong>usually</strong> you put these input objects in a sub-patch (or patch/patcher) and the sub-patch code has the filtering on it. (so all midi input objects in that sub-patch will only receive from the specific device) <br>Ive just noticed however, that this option is not available on monophonic patches, but I'll add it, as its potentially useful there too. (for now you can just use a polyphonic patch, and specify one voice)</p>

<p>My goal is to use the Linnstrument as a UI for a step sequencer inside Axoloti that could either target an internal synth or an external one via MIDI.  Your idea of a sequencer object seems to correspond to this, with different mappings/plugins for different hardware.</p>

<p>Would be fun to work on this together indeed ! Let's keep in touch !</p>

<p>I assume you mean when using USB HOST, determine the manufacturer string etc from usb descriptor?<br>currently we don't send the usb manufacture/device id anywhere, I guess we could if we needed.<br>though it gets more complicated when you support hubs (we don't currently) as obviously then you need to know which port its connected to.</p>

<p>(bare in mind midi messages only contains channel number and message type , and of course 2 data bytes)</p>

<p>anyway for you purposes it should be fine...</p>

<p>Id be interested to hear what you are planning to do with the Linnstrument  / step sequencer... <br>as essentially Im wanting to do the same thing with the Push, so there is very likely an opportunity for collaboration there.</p>

<p>note sure if you've seen but my general (axocube) project is described here : <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/axocube-project/425">https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/axocube-project/425</a>, and more specifically the work I'm doing with the push here : <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/ableton-push-controlling-axoloti/248">https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/ableton-push-controlling-axoloti/248</a></p>

<p>whilst the push video is not entirely applicable to your ideas... it covers an important point, which is how to control 'arbitrary' parameters from a controller, rather than having to patch the controller directly in to the patch.<br>(this is going to be support in a new feature called 'controller objects' which I've just added to axoloti, not yet in main repo) </p>

<p>what I want to do is to have something similar with a really elaborate step sequencer. something between what the Spectralis and Elektron has.  (obviously will 'evolve to this') ... my current idea is to build a new sequencer object, and then that could be 'rendered' differently to different controllers (which obviously have different capabilities)</p>

<p>anyway... may be can work together on making this a reality, as its alot of work for one... and I tend to be working on many things simultaneously <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>If I understand correctly, an object like midi/in/keyb will accept data from all the usb ports (HOST, DEVICE, DIN) without a way of knowing where the data comes from ?</p>

<p>If this is true, I assume it would be possible to do custom scripts using MIDI_DEVICE_DIN, MIDI_DEVICE_USB_HOST and MIDI_DEVICE_USB_DEVICE ?</p>

<p>The reason for this is that I don't want to send back to the Linnstrument the note data from the sequencer output, only specific messages to control the lights on it.</p>

<p>(I would test this but my device is not here yet and I was curious as to how this could work)</p>

<p>yes, you can use host, device and din all at the same time without worry.</p>

<p>btw: Im sure you know, but I also added native MPE support, look at the demo/synth/mpe for a couple of examples.<br>I love using axoloti with my soundplane and eigenharp so many ways you can shape sound when you can send the x/y/z anywhere... also been done a couple of patches where i just treat it as a big multitouch x/y/z surface which is fun too .</p>
