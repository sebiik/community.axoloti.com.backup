        <p>This is the start of a project Im working on, to allow an Ableton Push to fully control Axoloti patches.</p>

<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="aiwNTPzcKF0" data-youtube-title="Axoloti with Ableton Push" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>

<p>I love both Axoloti and the Push, both are really powerful and flexible, and using the Push to control Axoloti I think opens up some interesting possibilities.</p>

<p>e.g. imagine using the Push to drive a probability sequencer, its got plenty of buttons/pads and encoders, and great feedback via the LCD.. There are not many dedicated hardware sequencers that can offer the possibilities Axoloti+Push can offer.</p>

<p>but with Axoloti, load another patch… and now the Push/Axoloti is a drum machine, a synth, and FX machine. </p>

<p>Early days… but as you can see in the video, Ive all the basics in place - ready to untether and unleash Axoloti.</p>

<p>Im excited... anyone else interested <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile"></p>

        <p>Yeah, still lots to do... as Im aiming for a complete workflow, rather than just a controller (e.g. like how Push works with Ableton) <br>the technical infrastructure is in largely place, though I still need to do further revisions on Axoloti's USB host driver, and also add some functionality to the parameter exchange (e.g. types).<br>(the good news for non-push users is this is likely to improve the Axoloti's capabilities to support all external controllers. e.g. iOS via Lemur, Launchpads, Maschine )</p>

<p>but as Im sure your aware, even adding things like sequencers, drum pads is pretty major work, especially when trying to integrate them into an existing framework (Axoloti) ... but I'm pretty familiar with Axoloti firmware now, so its getting easier.</p>

<p>anyway, will post more videos as I progress.</p>

<p>a happy day, its taken me quite alot of time, but finally found and squashed a bug in the firmware that has been hounding me since I started this push project... I think things will progress a lot faster now!</p>

        <p>currently no.... </p>

<p>there are two issues</p>

<p>a) the LCD, but Ive already determined how to program that (I have it working on Linux, not axoloti yet) ... so there is a potential for full graphics on it ... e.g. imagine the scopes being displayable <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:">  so no real issue, just an opportunity.</p>

<p>b) USB 2 ... i noticed even on the midi side it doesn't work with Axoloti, I need to debug the firmware to check, but Johannes has just mentioned that Axoloti does not support USB 2 high speed, and it could be (need to check!) that this is why the Push 2 is not working.</p>

<p>if (b) proves to not be a fundamental problem, then yes, I'm likely to get it working soon...</p>

<p>if it is a problem, then I will be taking a new approach for my AxoCube project. I will develop the Push 2 interaction to be work on the PI2/Beagleboard, and Axoloti will have a 'remote' setup on it, just that it is controlled by the PI2.<br>this approach has some advantages for me:</p>

<ul>
<li>The PI2 (and so Push 2) could control/monitor/view multiple Axoloti cores (important for axo cube)</li>
<li>it leaves the usb host port 'free' on the Axoloti cores for other things (communication is via the USB device port as the PI2 is hosting it)</li>
<li>the 'remote' controller software on the Axoloti could be used by other controllers e.g. say an iPad.</li>

        <p>ok, confirmed Push 2 requires USB 2.0 high speed, and axoloti does not support this (only USB 2.0 full speed)</p>

<p>sooo.... my efforts will turn to using the PI2/Beagleboard black as a master using axoloti as voice/fx cards, controllable from the master.</p>

<p>second board, good move.... I kind of view axoloti as modular in this regard, e.g. like voice boards or fx cards, means you dont have to overload one board. and you can just re-program them when you need something different.<br>(I will admit, I still dont quite have mine setup so that I can use them as much as I want... but getting there slowly)</p>

        <p>This is fantastic, and one of the primary reasons I ended up buy the Axoloti today! So much potential. Do you have a github I could help contribute to? or are you just going to go solo?</p>

        <p>which are you interested in Push 1, or Push 2?</p>

<p>Push 1, I have to decide what to do with, as I don't have a Push 1 anymore ( I traded it in for the Push 2), so won't be able to take it further, as I don't have a way to test changes. I guess I could put whats there on my github, will need to check what state it was in when I left it  (as far as I remember its got parameters, patch loading, scales), can then be picked up by others if they desire.</p>

<p>Push 2, initially I'll do the dev/testing 'solo' (as you put it), then once its got to a reasonable stage decide how best to release it.  (its going to be part of a bigger project, but should I guess be useable outside of it)</p>

        <p>I have a push 1, and will most likely not be upgrading anytime soon. I can not commit to anything (don't even have my board yet, just ordered) but your project is very interesting to me. A stand alone push, driving midi, and down the road, cv-able gear, through the axoloti is exactly what I would like to be doing. I'm pretty new to hardware hacking, so I have a feeling I am pretty far off from meaningful contributions, was mostly looking to do code clean up and bug fixes to get my head around it all.</p>

<p>Thanks for your response!</p>

        <p>the Push 1 is perfect for controlling 1 axoloti board... I did seriously considered not trading mine in, and just getting a Push 2 (which is awesome in a different way) but thought Id probably not use it enough to really justify it.... </p>

<p>I'll see what I can do about the code, pretty busy at the moment, trying to sort out a few things before the holidays... but I suspect this code, is not the first thing you will want to dig into when you get your Axoloti <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

        <p>Hi, </p>

<p>I am interested in the control of Axoloti with Push too. I just wanted to know if it is usable right now, and whether or not purchsing a Push 2 is worth it regardig the same task, especially since thetechnobear seems to suggest that Axoloti is somehow incompatible with Axoloti.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Best</p>

        <p>The Push 2 is not compatible with Axoloti , since it uses USB 2.0 high speed.</p>

<p>My plan, is I'm going to run a PI2 that will host axolotis (4 <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> )  and the Push 2, and other controllers on a USB hub... <br>and the Push 2 will control the axoloti in a similar way to what you see above with the Push 1.</p>

<p>i.e. rather than Push -&gt; Axoloti , I have Push2-&gt; PI2 -&gt; Axoloti(4)</p>

<p>If you want direct control, which I admit was really nice, then go for a Push 1... <br>the Push 1 was slightly better for this as well, because when running on USB power it was very much still useable, not really the case with the Push2 as it requires alot more power.</p>

<p>I was quite tempted to keep my Push 1 for this, but frankly thought I wouldn't use it enough to justify it.  also I figured over time, the cost for a used Push 1 is going to drop, so might pick one up then <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
