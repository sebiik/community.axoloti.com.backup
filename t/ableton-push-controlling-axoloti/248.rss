    <title>Ableton Push controlling Axoloti</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/ableton-push-controlling-axoloti/248</link>
    <description>This is the start of a project Im working on, to allow an Ableton Push to fully control Axoloti patches.

https://youtu.be/aiwNTPzcKF0

I love both Axoloti and the Push, both are really powerful and flexible, and using the Push to control Axoloti I think opens up some interesting possibilities.

e.g. imagine using the Push to drive a probability sequencer, its got plenty of buttons/pads and encoders, and great feedback via the LCD.. There are not many dedicated hardware sequencers that can offer the possibilities Axoloti+Push can offer.

but with Axoloti, load another patch… and now the Push/Axoloti is a drum machine, a synth, and FX machine. 

Early days… but as you can see in the video, Ive all the basics in place - ready to untether and unleash Axoloti.

Im excited... anyone else interested :smile:</description>

              <p>Hi, i have a push just laying around, got it for about 120$ here in sweden, they are dirt cheap atm <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> been thinking that it would be a perfect controller for axoloti, or even using the euxaloti to create a cv sequncer, but im getting ahead of myself. I dont now any coding but i really want to use the push without a pc!</p>

<p>One problem i stumbled upon using the push object is that the encoders send midi notes when you touch them, very anying!<br>anyone know why?</p>

<p>anyway, great work getting this started, just wish someone would continue working on this <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>sorry guys busy on other projects at the moment.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/hugo">@Hugo</a>  its a while since i read the code. I think this will be problematic, since the parameter table it uses, I dont think knows anything about the hierarchy of objects/patches.<br>there are 2 changes probably for the future:<br>a) parameter need to have more meta data/stucture <br>b) custom objects for push, to allow the UI to be 'explicitly' designed.</p>

<p>(a) is need for axoloti control , so is likely to happen, then the Push object will need updating.<br>(b) could be done now, and could be done in a similar way to the way I use axocontrol. <br>the latter is more flexible, since a completely custom display could be made, the disadvantage is you probably have to add 'patching code' to each patch you use... but you can consider this is 'building its UI'<br>... its probably what I would do for now, and I was going to do this for a sequencer, as its the only way to make a decent UI.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/shrigg">@Shrigg</a> yeah, I'm keeping an eye out still ... prices are still about 50% more over in Europe... <br>Im pretty close to have a Push 1 emulator for the Push 2 running on a rasperry PI, but as always this is competing with other things Im doing <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>connecting 2 axo in series and combining the parameters to display on the push wont work (without dev effort).<br>the issue is axoloti has no way currently of sharing parameters across boards.<br>with a bit of dev, you could possibly 'hack it' by forwarding push midi messages , by creating an 'intelligent' switch... but thats not trivial to make it work well.. (the push object 'optimises' the display sysex messages to keep 'load' lower)</p>

<p>seeing a 'world view' of parameters/objects, might also be something thats valuable for axoloti control.</p>

<p>(my intention for using with a 'PI hub' was to rewrite this, and basically get the Axoloti to push parameter data to the hub, and then the PI would render to the Push) </p>

<p>generally, the axoloti firmware needs a bit of development to help more elaborate controllers have a good UI, but as mentioned above, this effort is also a requirement for axoloti control.</p>

              <p>The stuff that is implemented works perfectly.</p>

<p>I am now thinking about making some improvements. Maybe you can help me to get started. I would really like to be able to make some kind of selection of control dials that are accessible from Push. Right now all control dials throughout all subpatch levels are used. The obvious approach would be to restrict the selection to the controls avialable in the top level, i.e. the main patch. Any tips on how to get started there.</p>

<p>I think most things were working, like browsing and loading from the SD card... scales, parameters...<br>(you can add more scales in axo_push_scale.h ) </p>

<p>I agree it does open up Axoloti a lot, I actually miss having it around, it was great that it could be powered directly from axoloti.</p>

              <p>as far as I know, it should be working...</p>

<p>I used to put this in a controller object (subpatch), but for testing purposes you can just place it on the patch.</p>

<p>in the console when you connect the push, you should see it also recognised as a midi device; </p>

<p>you then need to set the device input and output, from memory this is 'usb host port 2' (but try 1) <br>... as you will know, this is due to the Push having 2 midi ports, 'user' and 'live', and axoloti has to talk to the right one.<br>(you'll know immediately, as the pad and display will do things)</p>

<p>Note: these are attributes, so you have to 'restart' the patch, to take effect.</p>

<p>sorry, I know, Im using works like 'should' and 'from memory', but unfortunately, I traded in my Push 1 for a Push 2, so I can't test it here. </p>

<p>Im pretty sure it was working fine last time I used it, but stupidly before I packed up he Push1 to go to ableton, I didn't do a final test.</p>

<p>what I might be able to do, is to do a test with an Push 1 emulator on the Push 2... though this can only be via a PC.</p>

<p>well it works, and it was further on than shown in the video  -but yes, its not as far as I was going to take it... and I wont be taking it further (unless I convince myself to get another P1 <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> )  </p>

              <p>The Push 2 is not compatible with Axoloti , since it uses USB 2.0 high speed.</p>

<p>My plan, is I'm going to run a PI2 that will host axolotis (4 <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> )  and the Push 2, and other controllers on a USB hub... <br>and the Push 2 will control the axoloti in a similar way to what you see above with the Push 1.</p>

<p>i.e. rather than Push -&gt; Axoloti , I have Push2-&gt; PI2 -&gt; Axoloti(4)</p>

<p>If you want direct control, which I admit was really nice, then go for a Push 1... <br>the Push 1 was slightly better for this as well, because when running on USB power it was very much still useable, not really the case with the Push2 as it requires alot more power.</p>

<p>I was quite tempted to keep my Push 1 for this, but frankly thought I wouldn't use it enough to justify it.  also I figured over time, the cost for a used Push 1 is going to drop, so might pick one up then <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

              <p>Hi, </p>

<p>I am interested in the control of Axoloti with Push too. I just wanted to know if it is usable right now, and whether or not purchsing a Push 2 is worth it regardig the same task, especially since thetechnobear seems to suggest that Axoloti is somehow incompatible with Axoloti.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

              <p>the Push 1 is perfect for controlling 1 axoloti board... I did seriously considered not trading mine in, and just getting a Push 2 (which is awesome in a different way) but thought Id probably not use it enough to really justify it.... </p>

<p>I'll see what I can do about the code, pretty busy at the moment, trying to sort out a few things before the holidays... but I suspect this code, is not the first thing you will want to dig into when you get your Axoloti <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

              <p>I have a push 1, and will most likely not be upgrading anytime soon. I can not commit to anything (don't even have my board yet, just ordered) but your project is very interesting to me. A stand alone push, driving midi, and down the road, cv-able gear, through the axoloti is exactly what I would like to be doing. I'm pretty new to hardware hacking, so I have a feeling I am pretty far off from meaningful contributions, was mostly looking to do code clean up and bug fixes to get my head around it all.</p>

<p>Thanks for your response!</p>

              <p>which are you interested in Push 1, or Push 2?</p>

<p>Push 1, I have to decide what to do with, as I don't have a Push 1 anymore ( I traded it in for the Push 2), so won't be able to take it further, as I don't have a way to test changes. I guess I could put whats there on my github, will need to check what state it was in when I left it  (as far as I remember its got parameters, patch loading, scales), can then be picked up by others if they desire.</p>

<p>Push 2, initially I'll do the dev/testing 'solo' (as you put it), then once its got to a reasonable stage decide how best to release it.  (its going to be part of a bigger project, but should I guess be useable outside of it)</p>

              <p>ok, confirmed Push 2 requires USB 2.0 high speed, and axoloti does not support this (only USB 2.0 full speed)</p>

<p>sooo.... my efforts will turn to using the PI2/Beagleboard black as a master using axoloti as voice/fx cards, controllable from the master.</p>

<p>second board, good move.... I kind of view axoloti as modular in this regard, e.g. like voice boards or fx cards, means you dont have to overload one board. and you can just re-program them when you need something different.<br>(I will admit, I still dont quite have mine setup so that I can use them as much as I want... but getting there slowly)</p>

              <p>currently no.... </p>

<p>there are two issues</p>

<p>a) the LCD, but Ive already determined how to program that (I have it working on Linux, not axoloti yet) ... so there is a potential for full graphics on it ... e.g. imagine the scopes being displayable <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:">  so no real issue, just an opportunity.</p>

<p>b) USB 2 ... i noticed even on the midi side it doesn't work with Axoloti, I need to debug the firmware to check, but Johannes has just mentioned that Axoloti does not support USB 2 high speed, and it could be (need to check!) that this is why the Push 2 is not working.</p>

<p>if (b) proves to not be a fundamental problem, then yes, I'm likely to get it working soon...</p>

<p>if it is a problem, then I will be taking a new approach for my AxoCube project. I will develop the Push 2 interaction to be work on the PI2/Beagleboard, and Axoloti will have a 'remote' setup on it, just that it is controlled by the PI2.<br>this approach has some advantages for me:</p>

<ul>
<li>The PI2 (and so Push 2) could control/monitor/view multiple Axoloti cores (important for axo cube)</li>
<li>it leaves the usb host port 'free' on the Axoloti cores for other things (communication is via the USB device port as the PI2 is hosting it)</li>
<li>the 'remote' controller software on the Axoloti could be used by other controllers e.g. say an iPad.</li>
