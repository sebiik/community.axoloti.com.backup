        <p>i would be interested in what you did to those boards? were they simply failing with nothing attached? was there a misconnection at some point? i have never fried one of my 6 axoloties, and i am wondering if i just got lucky or if you or SirSickSik did something to fry it...</p>

        <p>Well it was mostly my fault. The first board I fried was because I was fiddling on breadboard with a simple circuit to control a motor with an external power supply. I guess I mixed some wire up and i'm pretty sure I sent 9V into the the PWM output of the AXO.<br>The second one I was trying to improve this circuit, I added protection and did everything by the book but it still got fried, but this time very much like the issue described at the beginning of this thread. For a short while, I could still use the board but it would give me some odd voltages and get pretty hot. After a while, it just stopped communicating with the patcher and the board is now non responsive.</p>

<p>Still sad I fried both of these and I'm still determined to develop a proper circuit to control motors with Axo, but I must admit i'm very reluctant to try this again with my only two remaining boards…</p>

        <p>my first board that fried was of the first version and that one burned when I connected the usb plug and somehow it connected one thing (ground/power) before the other(or something like this, anyways, this was fixed in later versions), where it was immediately clear that it burned a component.</p>

<p>My other boards are later versions, but somehow also burned due to something going wrong with the usb connection.<br>None of the boards have anything special attached to them, except the boards in my suitecase, where one unit is broken and where I've only serially connected midi-ins and outs (properly) from board to board.</p>

<p>So I was hoping that there might be a component close to the usb input that could have burned before anything else broke and I might still be able to revive the board. Seeing that there is no clear view on any new boards in the near future, we're forced to somehow fix broken boards or be left with none in the end..</p>

        <p>I'm an experienced axo board burner I'm afraid. In one case, when I had a power cable that came loose running hot voltage across the board, in the end I was able to fix it, as it was just a burned protection thingy, in other cases I supplied 5V on the wrong side of the voltage regulator. Here IC4 is fried and this is WAY to small for me to attempt to repair myself... But if you have a microscope and you know what you're doing, in many cases it will be this problem... The symptoms are a hot IC3, no damage to other components</p>

  <blockquote>
    A few unexpected board failures have been reported, here's the analysis. 

Scope

Affects board revision 1.0, fixed in board revision 1.1

Symptoms:


The red LED keeps blinking forever after startup, while green LED is steady on
Establishing connection is still possible, but extremely low voltages are reported for the 5V supply and the VDD supply, and patches don't run.
IC3 (right behind the output jack) becomes extremely hot


(all three!) 

Failure analysis:

While any short on the audio powe…
