    <description>A few unexpected board failures have been reported, here&#39;s the analysis.

## Scope
* Affects board revision 1.0, fixed in board revision 1.1

## Symptoms:

* The red LED keeps blinking forever after startup, while green LED is steady on
* Establishing connection is still possible, but extremely low voltages are reported for the 5V supply and the VDD supply, and patches don&#39;t run.
* IC3 (right behind the output jack) becomes extremely hot

(all three!)

## Failure analysis:

While any short on the audio power supply would exhibit the same symptoms, the failures reported are caused by a failure of IC4 - that is the line output driver. Its failure causes the analog audio power supply (VDDA) to short to ground, and the regulator (IC3) heats up.
The damage to IC4 is permanent. The overheating of IC3 stops when IC4 is isolated from the power supply without damage to IC3 or other components.
IC4 fails when there is a large voltage difference between ground and line output ground. Normally this does not happen, many users have been (hot)plugging USB, in- and outputs countless times without failure. 
The reason that line output ground is different from general ground is ground loop noise suppression. In short, IC4 acts as a little active DI-box, and the resistance between line output ground and general ground minimizes supply current to flow through the line output. 
For details about the ground loop elimination circuit, refer to [sloa143.pdf](http://www.ti.com/lit/an/sloa143/sloa143.pdf) from Texas Instruments. 

## Causes

* Some USB cables do not connect the shields between the two ends of the cable. This is in violation of the usb specifications, but not all cables comply with this... 
When plugging in such a cable, it is possible that VBUS (the USB power supply pin) connects before the ground pin. 
When there is a connection between line out and, for example, a soundcard, the PC ground is connected briefly to line out ground before there is a connection to USB ground. 
At that point the bypass capacitors across VBUS are still uncharged so the whole 5V from USB VBUS applies between line out ground and general ground, and kills IC4.
A proper USB cable connects the shields of the two ends of the cable, and the shields connects the ground between PC and Axoloti common ground before the USB pins make contact, and no supply current will flow through the line out ground.


* Using the DC socket power input with a non-isolated adapter.
A DC barrel socket does not guarantee the order in which connection is established: ground first or supply first. When using a typical off-the-shelf adapter, there is no problem, as it is galvanically isolated from any other connection.
When one power adapter with multiple DC plugs is used with interconnected equipment


## Adding protection to the line output

The voltage between line out ground and common ground can be clamped by adding two diodes:
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/1X/1f7e680aea905b6aa3912e8b4e5bd7d92d90db94.PNG&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;320&quot;&gt;
The suggested type is 1N4001, 1N4004 or 1N4007, but most rectifier diodes will be fine.
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/1X/52b8fc964f6d2b1fde47d2c535637da7ad5ff458.PNG&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;411&quot;&gt;
While you&#39;re there I also suggest to add output resistors. This eliminates distortion caused by overloading the line output driver when a mono jack cable is inserted in the line output:
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/1X/a142709490da412a1730ee39be2ec5340df779cf.PNG&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;320&quot;&gt;
Recommended resistance is 20 to 100 Ohm. Cut the tracks on the bottom side of the board where the yellow triple dots are.

Board revision v1.1 (&quot;Axoloti Core v1.1&quot; is printed on the edge of the circuit board) has these diodes and output resistors already.</description>

              <p>I'm an experienced axo board burner I'm afraid. In one case, when I had a power cable that came loose running hot voltage across the board, in the end I was able to fix it, as it was just a burned protection thingy, in other cases I supplied 5V on the wrong side of the voltage regulator. Here IC4 is fried and this is WAY to small for me to attempt to repair myself... But if you have a microscope and you know what you're doing, in many cases it will be this problem... The symptoms are a hot IC3, no damage to other components</p>

              <p>my first board that fried was of the first version and that one burned when I connected the usb plug and somehow it connected one thing (ground/power) before the other(or something like this, anyways, this was fixed in later versions), where it was immediately clear that it burned a component.</p>

<p>My other boards are later versions, but somehow also burned due to something going wrong with the usb connection.<br>None of the boards have anything special attached to them, except the boards in my suitecase, where one unit is broken and where I've only serially connected midi-ins and outs (properly) from board to board.</p>

<p>So I was hoping that there might be a component close to the usb input that could have burned before anything else broke and I might still be able to revive the board. Seeing that there is no clear view on any new boards in the near future, we're forced to somehow fix broken boards or be left with none in the end..</p>

              <p>Well it was mostly my fault. The first board I fried was because I was fiddling on breadboard with a simple circuit to control a motor with an external power supply. I guess I mixed some wire up and i'm pretty sure I sent 9V into the the PWM output of the AXO.<br>The second one I was trying to improve this circuit, I added protection and did everything by the book but it still got fried, but this time very much like the issue described at the beginning of this thread. For a short while, I could still use the board but it would give me some odd voltages and get pretty hot. After a while, it just stopped communicating with the patcher and the board is now non responsive.</p>

<p>Still sad I fried both of these and I'm still determined to develop a proper circuit to control motors with Axo, but I must admit i'm very reluctant to try this again with my only two remaining boards…</p>

<p>Continuity between the plug shields on both ends of the USB cable is what matters.<br>Using a DC supply is fine, if you use it with an off-the-shelf wall-wart powering only Axoloti. Not if you use some sort of DC split cable to power a mixer and axoloti from one power brick or battery.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>A few unexpected board failures have been reported, here's the analysis.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<ul><li>Affects board revision 1.0, fixed in board revision 1.1</li></ul>

<h2>Symptoms:</h2>

<ul>
<li>The red LED keeps blinking forever after startup, while green LED is steady on</li>
<li>Establishing connection is still possible, but extremely low voltages are reported for the 5V supply and the VDD supply, and patches don't run.</li>
<li>IC3 (right behind the output jack) becomes extremely hot</li>
</ul>

<p>(all three!)</p>

<h2>Failure analysis:</h2>

<p>While any short on the audio power supply would exhibit the same symptoms, the failures reported are caused by a failure of IC4 - that is the line output driver. Its failure causes the analog audio power supply (VDDA) to short to ground, and the regulator (IC3) heats up.<br>The damage to IC4 is permanent. The overheating of IC3 stops when IC4 is isolated from the power supply without damage to IC3 or other components.<br>IC4 fails when there is a large voltage difference between ground and line output ground. Normally this does not happen, many users have been (hot)plugging USB, in- and outputs countless times without failure. <br>The reason that line output ground is different from general ground is ground loop noise suppression. In short, IC4 acts as a little active DI-box, and the resistance between line output ground and general ground minimizes supply current to flow through the line output. <br>For details about the ground loop elimination circuit, refer to <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/an/sloa143/sloa143.pdf">sloa143.pdf</a> from Texas Instruments. </p>

<h2>Causes</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Some USB cables do not connect the shields between the two ends of the cable. This is in violation of the usb specifications, but not all cables comply with this... <br>When plugging in such a cable, it is possible that VBUS (the USB power supply pin) connects before the ground pin. <br>When there is a connection between line out and, for example, a soundcard, the PC ground is connected briefly to line out ground before there is a connection to USB ground. <br>At that point the bypass capacitors across VBUS are still uncharged so the whole 5V from USB VBUS applies between line out ground and general ground, and kills IC4.<br>A proper USB cable connects the shields of the two ends of the cable, and the shields connects the ground between PC and Axoloti common ground before the USB pins make contact, and no supply current will flow through the line out ground.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the DC socket power input with a non-isolated adapter.<br>A DC barrel socket does not guarantee the order in which connection is established: ground first or supply first. When using a typical off-the-shelf adapter, there is no problem, as it is galvanically isolated from any other connection.<br>When one power adapter with multiple DC plugs is used with interconnected equipment</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Adding protection to the line output</h2>

<p>The voltage between line out ground and common ground can be clamped by adding two diodes:<br><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/1f7e680aea905b6aa3912e8b4e5bd7d92d90db94" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/1X/1f7e680aea905b6aa3912e8b4e5bd7d92d90db94.PNG" class="lightbox" title="line-out-diodes.PNG"><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/1f7e680aea905b6aa3912e8b4e5bd7d92d90db94_1_690x320.PNG" width="690" height="320"><div class="meta">
