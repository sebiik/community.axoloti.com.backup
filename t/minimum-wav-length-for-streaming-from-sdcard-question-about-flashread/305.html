        <p>Hi all - I used to use a Discovery board and modified Firmware to load very short waveform samples for use in the flashread objects. Now I would like to attempt to transition to the more usable sdcard based sample loading and having a few challenges on getting my objects to work.</p>

<p>The first (simple?) issue is that my very short samples (e.g. 602 bytes) and I can't seem to get them to play even by triggering the "table/play" object. A longer sample (42kb) plays fine and the position can be adjusted as well (all but with very small numbers).</p>

<p>I am also wondering if this is a deadend idea anyway, since it seems sdcard streaming is vastly different from the way flashread works. I was able to automate during live mode, the table size allocation for flashread samples, which is something I would like to continue doing with a sdcard streaming - but is it possible?</p>

        <p>eh, well - i probably wasn't hooking things up correctly and went back to some original advice - to explore the sdram table2.axp . There you define the table length and i am getting sound.</p>

<p>i haven't seen that example file in recent releases and had some issues with the initi script. might start another topic about it. Hopefully will make some progress in the next few days.</p>

<p>***AHA that was pretty fun - used the read interp object to study how the table size was used and then was able to make an inlet to control it. Still have some dependencies on table/load and alloc objects, but should be very possible to make an intergrated object that takes care of all this stuff. Seems pretty stable!</p>
