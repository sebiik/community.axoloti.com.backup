    <title>Connecting the LKM1638 board</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/connecting-the-lkm1638-board/1242</link>
    <description>Now that I&#39;ve finished writing my book, it&#39;s time for me to build some actual instruments with Axoloti. I&#39;ll use this topic to document the process of connecting the LKM1638 board, so you have a starting point if you are interested in building an instrument with it. 

You can buy these boards for around €7 at [DealExtreme](http://www.dx.com/p/8x-digital-tube-8x-key-8x-double-color-led-module-81873). The specs of these boards:

* 8x 7-segment display
* 8x double-color green/red LED
* 8x button

A great thing is that the boards can be chained, so you could use two of them to create a 16-step sequencer. The boards use the SPI bus on the Axoloti, so you will only need 4 GPIO ports.

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/8/876579da82dd1aca7a708a908bcb1f1cdbeecc4c.jpg&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;328&quot;&gt;

**Creating Objects**
My goal is to develop some objects to work with this board. Some ideas:

* Send text to the 7-segment display
* Use the buttons as toggles, LEDs will show which toggle is on/off
* Use the buttons as a mini keyboard to play notes
* Use the buttons to toggle notes on/off in a sequencer.

A good starting point to work with this board, and create objects is this old test patch made by @johannes.
 
https://github.com/axoloti/axoloti/blob/master/archive/tests/io/spi_lkm1638.axh

If you connect the board to the Axoloti Core and run the patch, you&#39;ll get something like the photo below. The sel/sel b 16 objects reflect the state of the LEDs. Buttons can be used to cycle through the LED colors.

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/6/66a7eb48d6ca526d17a15ddfe88b4721aeab88a5.jpg&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;366&quot;&gt;

**Circuit Diagram**

* Connect VCC to VDD (RED)
* Connect GND to GND (Black)
* Connect STBO to PA4 (Blue)
* Connect CLK to PA5 (Green)
* Connect DIO to both PA6 and PA7 (Yellow)

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/d/df8d298227e85db5f8a53bfdb57ed25657358c08.png&quot; width=&quot;583&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;

**Patches**

You&#39;ll need to add a gpio/spi/config object to every patch you want to use with this board. These are the settings for the object:

* clock_polarity: CPOL=0
* clock_phase: CPHA=0
* baudrate: FPCLK/128
* format: LSB first

**Toggle Object**

The first object I&#39;m working on is a toggle object. The object will output booleans so you can use the 8 buttons on the board as toggles. The LEDs on the board will also reflect the state (on/off) of the toggle. A basic patch for the object looks like the screenshot below, I&#39;ll post the object once I&#39;m finished writing code + testing.

              <p>It's been a while since I've used the board. Think I did have some crashes during development, but that's was a long time ago.</p>

<p>I also have the SPI errors in the console when opening patches with my objects. Not sure how to fix those, as the firmware is not documented that well.</p>

<p>The original patch by Johannes is based on some code from a Raspberry Pi library, but don't know if it was really optimised to run on Axoloti. It was mainly a quick example on how to use SPI.</p>

              <p>my gut feeling says the board needs a "reset" or a "clear" either before a new patch load trigger is sent or as a reset before running any of the LKM1638 object code.</p>

<p>the reason that I think it is this is that I can always run a patch the first time it loads. This is the only reproducable pattern I can find...<br>so:<br>1. reset axo (usb cable out/in) flash patch running has got nothing to do with LKM1638<br>2. load a patch setting the display using <a class="mention" href="/u/janvantomme">@janvantomme</a>'s  lkm1638-display-toggle-leds<br>3. display shows nothing, is outlined above as a possible bug, the rest of the patch works fine<br>4. loading the </p>

<p>script, suddenly my text set in the previous patch pops up. This explains something is kept on the lkm1638 and transferred between patches, but it should be reset!<br>5. the patch works fine (buttons toggle LEDS, I can set them using the seq objects, but it should not display anything on the 7-segment display, yet it displays text from the first patch<br>6. load the first patch again.... no problem, I can switch back and forth between these two patches no problem at all<br>6. if I load <em>another</em> patch with different text in the  lkm1638-display-toggle-leds it crashes sometime, sometimes not... it becomes unstable...but it will crash after 2 or 3  display updates the latest</p>

              <p>HI I just hooked up my LKM1638 board I had lying around to my axo. It randomly crashes, sometimes before I update the text on the display. I'm using the adaptations <a class="mention" href="/u/andrewchi">@AndrewChi</a> suggested. </p>

<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/384943188571939f75ee256ec563a47c5a27f8bc" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/3/384943188571939f75ee256ec563a47c5a27f8bc.jpg" class="lightbox" title="image.jpg"><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/3/384943188571939f75ee256ec563a47c5a27f8bc_1_375x500.jpg" width="375" height="500"><div class="meta">

</div></a></div></p>

<p>I'm trying to have it display the current patchname and would love to have the buttons switch presets inside each patch.<br>I succeed sometimes in switching patch, sometimes it updates the name, sometimes not.</p>

<p>The AXO log just says </p>

<p>"Disconnect request"</p>

<p>and the axo becomes unresponsive until reset</p>

<p>I tried adding various delays, pulselengths etc... all crashes.</p>

<p>Even if I do not "use" the object, but just let it sit in the patch, it crashes, also when completely unconnected.<br>When I remove the object all is fine...</p>

<p>I'm using the lkm1638_full but I've had similar problems with the other object, and in that case axo was also logging some other SPI related errors, like:</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>&gt; Error: object "spi.begin_1" attribute "clock_polarity", value "0 when idle" unmatched
&gt; Error: object "spi.begin_1" attribute "clock_phase", value "first clock transition is the first data capture edge" unmatched</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>not in the case of lkm1638_full</p>

<p>any hints?</p>

<p>I now use a timer/delayed pulse object to update the display to keep the update rate slow, and this seems to work, when the delay is set above 100ms.</p>

<p>I found a very simple solution for the update display problem:<br>I used a pulse/lfsburst4 object to trigger the update input and it works. No cpu spikes whatsoever!<br>I guess 'normal' triggers were too long...</p>

<p>Has anyone experienced that LED 8 is lighting up when sending update display messages?<br>My LKM board is slightly different (also very cheap and only red LEDs). I guess it's the board's design? Or could I perhaps change something in the code to change this behaviour? I'm just starting out with code so any help/insight would be really great! Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi, I put some work into the original objects provided by <a class="mention" href="/u/janvantomme">@janvantomme</a>. It is now possible to update the text display while the object is live. I am using this with a string mux object to display the name of the currently selected patch. I have also added inputs for both LED colors and an inlet to clear the text display. </p>

<p>What I did not manage to solve is that the patch will crash if you update the display too frequently/quickly. I was able to make it more tolerant by adding sleep-commands in a couple of places, this is for sure not the right way to do it. However, this is not a problem for me since I am triggering the patches with a midi floorboard, my feet are slow enough not to exceed the max frequency <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> if anybody is interested in using this object and is more fund of programming, this can certainly be solved. <br>Here are the links to the object and an example patch:</p>

<p>Thanks to <a class="mention" href="/u/janvantomme">@janvantomme</a> for his work with this display module!</p>

              <p>Hi Jan, I am trying to get the LEDs and the display to work with the objects provided by you. I finally managed to hook this unit up to my axoloti and while the buttons are working, I get no response from neither the LEDS nor the  7-segment displays. I checked the unit with an arduino and it is just working fine. </p>

<p>I am using the example patches together with the exact same unit as shown in the photos, sourced from deal extreme a while ago. Any ideas?  Any input appreciated, thanks, Christian</p>

              <p>There's no way to control two boards at the same time for now. And I don't plan on developing that since I don't need it for my synth. But I think you can adapt my code if you want to chain two boards.</p>

<p>This is a piece of code from my objects.</p>

<pre><code>void tm1638_send_command(uint8_t x){
	SPID1.spi-&gt;CR1 |= SPI_CR1_BIDIOE;
	spiSelect(&amp;SPID1);
	txbuf[0] = x;
	spiSend(&amp;SPID1,1,&amp;txbuf[0]);
	spiUnselect(&amp;SPID1);
}</code></pre>

<p>And this is the same function from this Raspberry PI library. ( <a href="https://github.com/mjoldfield/pi-tm1638/blob/master/src/tm1638.c" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/mjoldfield/pi-tm1638/blob/master/src/tm1638.c</a> ) You'll notice that the first parameter in this function, the variable <code>t</code> is a reference to a single board when they are chained together.</p>

<pre><code>static void tm1638_send_command(const tm1638_p t, uint8_t x)
{
	bcm2835_gpio_write(t-&gt;strobe, LOW);
	delayMicroseconds(1);

	tm1638_send_raw(t, x);
	bcm2835_gpio_write(t-&gt;strobe, HIGH);

	delayMicroseconds(1);
}</code></pre>

<p>My code uses the SPI API from the Axoloti firmware, the other code uses a BCM2835 GPIO library for the Raspberry PI that does something similar. You'll probably find a lot of Arduino code to work with the LKM1638 boards online that might help you figure things out.</p>

You haven't mentioned whether two LKM1638 boards can be daisy chained together yet so I assume there isn't that capability yet. Do you know what's involved to make two units "talk" to one another? I could work on that part. I'm aiming to build a polysynth with built-in 64 step sequencer so 16 toggles would be ideal.</p>

<ul>
<li>Read when buttons are pressed, no LED output.</li>
<li>Read when buttons are pressed, LED output.</li>
<li>LED output, no button interaction.</li>
<li>Use buttons and LEDs as toggles.</li>

              <p>That looks fantastic, bravo! I'm going to take a stab at developing the object to accommodate two LKM1638 boards because my intention is to have a functional 16 step sequencer. Getting both displays working would be overkill, for me at least. I will prioritise the functionality of the LEDs and buttons first. Where did you get your white buttons from? I see what you mean regarding the removal of the 10 pin connector, will try to not fry my second board <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=2" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>Haven't had the chance to do a lot of programming on the objects lately. Currently building a new dedicated synth with Axoloti that will use one of the LKM1638 boards as a control. When the synth is finished, I'll start programming again.</p>

<p>I'll stick with using one board for now, my second one got damaged while desoldering the connectors. If you want to solder the LKM board directly to the Axoloti, it's better to remove the black plastic part, end solder the wires directly to the pins and bend them over so you can mount it inside a case.</p>

<p>I did some tests with a lasercut top plate and 3D printed buttons as well.</p>
