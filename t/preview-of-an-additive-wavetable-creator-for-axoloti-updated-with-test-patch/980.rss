    <description>Hey :smile:
Have been working on this patch for creating wavetable in Axoloti, not just loading them, but creating them from scratch, using Axolotis oscillators. And I think I got it working pretty well for now.. Anyway, just wanted to post a preview. Its recorded from a phone so the quality is not that good and you cannot here the sound only some mouse clicking. Sorry. But you can see the waveform change as harmonics are added. And morphed… the patch can create 1 cycle wavetables.  1cycle = 128 samples long... multicycles also works.

For exampe 64 waves is:
128 samples X 64 waves = 8192 samples. Pretty decent size.. But you can basicly make any sizes you want with a little bit of tuning to the patch.

The patch also includes saving them to Sd-card for later use :) I tested it and I can load the files in Audacity afterwards as raw files, export them to other synth, etc.. Pretty awesome. I am very excited about this :) 

I will share the patch when I get it cleaned up a bit.. Just thought I&#39;d share a teaser:

UPDATE:
Here is the patch. You can play with it, to get an idea of how it works and what is possible for now..... but it does not include the saving section yet, so you cant export the wavetables in this version yet. When my boards are fixed I will post the final version.

But it is VERY much fun to play with as it is now. 

Warning: dont look to much on the waveforms just before sleep.. When closing your eyes the waveforms will sweep across your eyelids ;) I got a bit nausea from doing that :) 

Anyway, ENJOY!</description>

<p>This is very similar to the one you created in PD. I cant get as many harmonics working, though.... I can only get 6 perfect harmonics and the last 2 (of the 8 in the video) is pitched so far up that they exceed Axolotis pitch range and becomes silent. The oscillator needs to be pitched a little bit high for the waveform to be only 128 samples long to fit in the scope. Or else you cannot see the whole waveform. Anyway.. there are plenty of other ways to add harmonics. </p>

<p>I was wondering what I could use that is equivelant to the Wavewrapper in PD from Axolotis object list? Gonna try waveshaper and see what that does.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
