    <title>Embedding Axoloti in MIDI Keyboard</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/embedding-axoloti-in-midi-keyboard/1061</link>
    <description>Hi All,

I have a midi keyboard I picked up from goodwill that has 5 pin din midi out. I&#39;d like to embed the Axoloti within this keyboard so it can run as a standalone synth, while retaining the original functionality of the midi keyboard.

I&#39;m thinking all that I have to do is wire the midi out from the keyboard right to the midi in of the Axoloti. Do I need to do anything to protect the Axoloti from other things that I might plug into this midi keyboard, or is it fine to just solder the midi pins to each other?

Thanks</description>
