    <description>&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/4/45a099bd018f575cbbf206259bd2a609113d68fd.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;388&quot;&gt;

The inset is the sub patch, and the patch loaded fine until I connected a midi device [specifically a drum machine] to the midi in. It worked fine, I removed the drum machine, then this happened?

Since then I get this error message

Other patches are working fine!

Any ideas? Haven&#39;t altered the patch in any way!

I've decided to keep it as open as possible, so I'm probably just going to put it in a box, maybe with a few rotary controllers, posibly get a second board to handle efects. I think it's mostly going to be controlled from my BeatStep Pro.</p>

<p>what about it is misleading/confusing in particular?<br>perhaps <a class="mention" href="/u/johannes">@johannes</a> could add annotations, if there are some things that are now out of date etc.</p>

<p>its a bit of a general problem with youtube videos for software, as the software gets updated so the videos become 'dated' , but its quite time consuming to create videos, so newer version are not forthcoming.</p>

<p>... Ive considered doing a series of videos on axoloti patching, but this is one of the reasons Ive been hesitant.</p>

<p>anyway, glad your up n running and patching away <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Sorry I haven't responded! </p>

<p>The board is working fine and I've sorted out the sub patching issue having done some research. </p>

<p>The patching video on YouTube is pretty misleading though [https://youtu.be/d7Xv99v1RwI]. Might want to take it down at some point as it's one of the first things that comes up if you search for "Axoloti tutorial" on Google.</p>

<p>Thanks for the all the help along the way. I do have other questions, but I'll post them in the proper forums when I've finished researching everything I need for this project </p>

<p>Have fun <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

              <p>ok, this was <strong>not</strong> caused by you plugging something in... as its a compilation error.</p>

<p>Id need to test the patch to see whats going on... id guess something to do with the sub patch settings, possibly to do with midi selector being turned on/off?   might be worth saving patch, then restarting axoloti, then load patch... to see if its some state glitch.</p>

<p>a more general point, this is not how you build polyphonic patches...<br>to be polyphonic, you need to all that you have in your main patch into the sub patch... since you need the midi/adsr and vcas all to have multiple instances.<br>have a look at File-&gt;Library-&gt;Factory-&gt;Demo-&gt;Synths-&gt;organ</p>
