    <description>One of the things I love about this forum, is that its always been a very friendly forum with everyone helping each other, sharing ideas filled with people from different backgrounds and experience and willing to listen to each other.

of course, there have been the occasional disagreement, but with very few exceptions, this have tended not to escalate - again a credit to you all :) 

we do try to moderate lightly here, hoping things will disperse quietly, and I really appreciate that you all take your part in this, by letting it fizzle out, rather than feeding it.

I&#39;d particularly like to thank those of you that flag posts that are inappropriate, rather than fuelling the &#39;issue&#39; - we appreciate it, its really helps the community.

of course, if posts/users becomes excessive, repetitive or abusive, we will take action.
we want axoloti community to remain a happy, inclusive and open place to share ideas for everyone. 


Thank you for making this place great ... you&#39;ve built a fantastic community here  :heart:



I&#39;d like to end on a couple of tips, that perhaps some are unaware of...

please flag ALL posts that you think are in appropriate **even** if its already flagged

discourse has a couple of cool community features,  
multiple flags on the the same post (from multiple users) will &#39;auto hide&#39; it.
multiple flags on a topic, will temporarily close the thread.
multiple flags on posts by a single user, will prevent them posting for a short while.

the aim of all of these is the same, 
it stops the &#39;issue&#39; spreading further - until a moderator has time to come and deal with it.
also as a moderator, if I see multiple users flagging I can see its a concern to more members of the community.


finally,  if any regular would like to help with moderation, please contact @johannes 
more moderators does not mean more moderation, rather it means incidents can be handle quicker, the moderation load can be spread.</description>
