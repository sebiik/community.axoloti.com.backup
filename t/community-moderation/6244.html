        <p>One of the things I love about this forum, is that its always been a very friendly forum with everyone helping each other, sharing ideas filled with people from different backgrounds and experience and willing to listen to each other.</p>

<p>of course, there have been the occasional disagreement, but with very few exceptions, this have tended not to escalate - again a credit to you all <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>we do try to moderate lightly here, hoping things will disperse quietly, and I really appreciate that you all take your part in this, by letting it fizzle out, rather than feeding it.</p>

<p>I'd particularly like to thank those of you that flag posts that are inappropriate, rather than fuelling the 'issue' - we appreciate it, its really helps the community.</p>

<p>of course, if posts/users becomes excessive, repetitive or abusive, we will take action.<br>we want axoloti community to remain a happy, inclusive and open place to share ideas for everyone. </p>

<p>Thank you for making this place great ... you've built a fantastic community here  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/heartae52.png?v=5" title=":heart:" class="emoji" alt=":heart:"></p>

<p>I'd like to end on a couple of tips, that perhaps some are unaware of...</p>

<p>please flag ALL posts that you think are in appropriate <strong>even</strong> if its already flagged</p>

<p>discourse has a couple of cool community features,<br>multiple flags on the the same post (from multiple users) will 'auto hide' it.<br>multiple flags on a topic, will temporarily close the thread.<br>multiple flags on posts by a single user, will prevent them posting for a short while.</p>

<p>the aim of all of these is the same, <br>it stops the 'issue' spreading further - until a moderator has time to come and deal with it.<br>also as a moderator, if I see multiple users flagging I can see its a concern to more members of the community.</p>

<p>finally,  if any regular would like to help with moderation, please contact <a class="mention" href="../../u/johannes.html">@johannes</a> <br>more moderators does not mean more moderation, rather it means incidents can be handle quicker, the moderation load can be spread.</p>
