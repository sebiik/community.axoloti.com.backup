        <p>you connect it to what ever you want to trigger the change... in this case it appears you want to use note on, so use the gate.</p>

<p>also you would debug it, connect an integer display to the note outlet as well, are you getting what you expect? your doing an implicit conversion, and your relying heavily on pressing the right key on the keyboard (so you get a preset value in the right range (0-8) </p>

<p>also have you tested that the presets are working as you expect?<br>have you tried connecting a dial, or number (int) to the preset to see if its working as you expect?<br>(use a moment button on trig, so you can observe the behaviour) </p>

<p>you need to separate things like , midi input, how the preset system works, and even checking the presets are setup as you expect into different 'units' , so you know exactly which are working (or not) as expected.</p>

<p>this kind of debugging is crucial to patch development, especially in the early days when you are learning about how axoloti works... things like 'ranges' or data not being quite as you expect is normal when learning new patching environments.<br>also learning good debugging techniques in the early days, on simple patches, will really help you when you get to doing complex patches, and you need to find the 'pesky' bugs.</p>

        <blockquote><p>you connect it to what ever you want to trigger the change... in this case it appears you want to use note on, so use the gate.</p></blockquote>

<p>If I try do what I understand you're suggesting, I get a black broken line:<br><img src="https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c81771ddf10123ad3afcc5bf34efca62856dbbdc.png" width="362" height="341"></p>

<p>I also tried this:</p>

<p><img src="https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c3281d42fc74c3cf9484da858de4eb5d490691c1.png" width="435" height="362"></p>

<p>Neither worked for me unfortunately.</p>

<blockquote><p>also you would debug it, connect an integer display to the note outlet as well, are you getting what you expect? your doing an implicit conversion, and your relying heavily on pressing the right key on the keyboard (so you get a preset value in the right range (0-8)</p></blockquote>

<p>Thanks for the tip, I double clicked, and searched for any and all thing I could think of, but couldn't find any 'integer display'</p>

<blockquote><p>also have you tested that the presets are working as you expect?</p></blockquote>

<p>Yes they work when clicking them in the GUI.</p>

<blockquote><p>have you tried connecting a dial, or number (int) to the preset to see if its working as you expect?<br>(use a moment button on trig, so you can observe the behaviour)</p></blockquote>

<p>again I can't find these controls</p>

<blockquote><p>this kind of debugging is crucial to patch development, especially in the early days when you are learning about how axoloti works... things like 'ranges' or data not being quite as you expect is normal when learning new patching environments.<br>also learning good debugging techniques in the early days, on simple patches, will really help you when you get to doing complex patches, and you need to find the 'pesky' bugs.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yes I feel like I'm missing something. I have read most of the 'getting started with Axoloti book', but otherwise feeling in over my head here, and a bit frustrated perhaps.</p>

<p>I'm an experienced programmer, so know I'm capable of getting this, but I'm not sure if i missed a manual or wiki or something (I've searched around here quite a lot), or is everyone else coming form some other useful background like Pure data, DSP or something that makes this stuff more obvious? Or should I just spend some time looking at other people's patches? Any direction would be appreciated, I don't want to burn out your good will with tiny details like this, if it can be avoided. <img src="https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>no I said, connect to the gate on midi/in/note</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-s">perhaps its worth looking at <a class="mention" href="../../users/janvantomme.html">@janvantomme</a> book, Ive put a link to it in the user guide.</span><br>(sorry just read, you were reading it) </p>

<p>black dotted lines... you cannot connect an inlet to an inlet<br>why would you get the sequencer to trigger the preset change? is that what you want? if so why would you make the presets value from the midi/in/note?</p>

<p>as an experience programmer, you'll know, these things take a bit of time to understand the basic principles - the trick is to start small, and really to use things like disp/* and ctrl/* objects to get a good feeling for how things work... like any programming, just connecting stuff in the hope it'll work, will just confuse you ... it'll act 'odd' as you asking it to do odd things.<br>the great thing about 'typeless' programming, is it just works... but the flip side is, it doesn't throw errors when your doing things that are perhaps unintentional. </p>

<p> (sorry , Ive not read <a class="mention" href="../../users/janvantomme.html">@janvantomme</a> book, so whilst its getting good comments, I dont know what it covers)</p>

        <p>Thanks for you advice, I'll see how that works out and let you know.</p>

<p>For the above, all I want to do is be able to switch between the 2 presets using the midi controller somehow. </p>

<p>I know when button on the midi controller has a cc value of 1 and 2, so that's what I thought to use, and why i would use midi/in/note.</p>

<p>Again you mention 'midi/in/note', but I don't know what that is. Do you mean 'midi/in/keyb note'? Should I use that instead?</p>

<blockquote><p>why would you get the sequencer to trigger the preset change? is that what you want? if so why would you make the presets value from the midi/in/note?</p></blockquote>

<p>The sequencer is set up to play different things depending on the preset. I was trying to somehow pass the preset selection to the sequencer. - bonkers I know! but that's what can happen when you don't know your arse from your elbow! <img src="https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<blockquote><p>the trick is to start small, and really to use things like disp/* and ctrl/* objects to get a good feeling for how things work</p></blockquote>

<p>ok well I have had a small win by taking on the spirit of your suggetion </p>

<p><img src="https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c276f7d0fb6ec27bfe636d48ca12f72e48c47589.png" width="324" height="269"></p>

<p>This works but I have to select the 1 or 2 in ctrl / i and then hit the ctrl/button.</p>

<p>That's better that clicking the preset button on the top at least, will try and improve on that tomorrow... </p>

<p>Any tips welcome <img src="https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> g'night!</p>
