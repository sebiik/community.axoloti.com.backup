    <title>Filters with Self-Oscillation</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/filters-with-self-oscillation/6034</link>
    <description>I am wondering which filter objects are filters with self-oscillation? I noticed, for example, on SSS&#39;s morphMode filter it mentions:

&gt; Center position is bandpass, lowest position (negative) is lowpass and highest position (positive) is highpass.
&gt; Resonance works in all modes, though only the LP filter has self oscillation.

So persumably with resonance turned up in LP mode you would get a sine output like with an analog fitler? I&#39;ve tried this and cannot get any output from the filter, I&#39;ve tried this on a couple, same result no output. Is there something I am missing here?</description>

              <p>patatos, this was great advice! Adding a little gausian noise through an offset mixer to the input seems to push a few of the filters into self oscillation. Apart from vcf4pole2x here are ones that I tested that also work:</p>

<p>sss/filter/dualvcf3 63.50 res<br>sss/filter/bppSVF 61.50 res<br>wp/filter/4polelpf 63 res</p>

<p>vcf4pole2x has the purest sine from the ones I tested so it's the best bet.</p>

              <p>Hi Dianus, there are a lot of filters in the library and maybe I haven’t checked them all, but I must say that the majority of them have a bad behaviour at extreme value of resonance: distortion, aliasing etc.  There are good filters in the community/tiar/filter folder but my favourite is the runge-kutta modelled filter vcf4pole2x in the community/jt/filter folder, it’s not surprising  that it takes  more DSP resources. You can take it to a beautiful self oscillation if you inject in it a tiny bit of signal, i. e. gaussian noise, so that it’s practically inaudible, with the resonance parameter at 64. <a class="attachment" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/0/07968c72d76fcc423810d4e683b585482ec09cd8.axp">SELF_RESO_exp.axp</a> (2.8 KB)</p>
