    <description>Hello all,

long time I have not been online here, but now I could need some help:

I have a new laptop with win10 installed: now I downloaded all the latest firmwares and some former ones along with the _runtime.zip

axoloti-win-1.0.12-2-java1.8.0-191

I think at the beginning I had no Java whatsoever installed, but this did not seem to be a problem, now i have java 1.8 installed still with the same result.

I can start the .exe file, then this is what gets printed in the console window:

I have right now the 2.0 version installed, in the normal 1.0.12 version I do not get an error, just for your notice:

So after this I usually can connect to the board, but in my case nothing whatsoever is connecting, not even an error, just nothing.
Also I cannot click on Board: select device, nothing happens.


Is this a known issue on win10?
I also have my old win7 machine running, on this machine everything works just alright (of course with the same axoloti board connected, with the same usb cable and everything)
So with my old win7 machine I could check everything, I know the USB is detected correctly I can load patches as I used to.

But on my new machine even with the old configurations 1.0.3 ( the same as on my win7 machine) i cannot detect nor connect to the device.

Is there anyone who maybe has a clue why this could be, maybe it has something to do with the USB driver?
But on both machines the Axoloti appears in the audio devices in the device manager, so I think it has to be alright.


Thanks a lot for reading and maybe even helping.

Best wishes, and stay at home and be healthy.

              <p>It's best to use version 1.0.12 for now, as 2.0.0 is too experimental and not stable enough for daily use.</p>

<p>The issue you are having is probably that the new version of the compiler that 2.x uses is not installed yet.</p>
