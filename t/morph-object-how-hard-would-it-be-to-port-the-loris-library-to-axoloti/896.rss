    <title>Morph object - How hard would it be to port the LORIS library to axoloti?</title>

    <description>LORIS is a sound modeling package based on the Reassigned Bandwidth-Enhanced Additive Sound Model.

http://www.cerlsoundgroup.org/Loris/
 
Im curious to know how possible it would be to port to the Axoloti. I am posting this now before I start building this because I want thoughts on the best way to build it. Do I go maths route or try to covert the existing Loris code?

Existing open source example of a morph object:
The Loris software modules have a well documented example of both the DSP mathmatics and doing this in C:
http://www.cerlsoundgroup.org/Loris/LorisMorphingInC.html

There are a few other exmples of a moprh object in csound but this one is probably the best in terms of documentation and the number of source conversions available.

Why a morph object?
A morph is not the same thing as cross fading. A morph causes the sound to change between the characteristics of one input into another. You could for example Morph between a sine wav and a square wave to get all the wave forms in between, morph between delay and reverb, piano into a violin etc you get the idea. 
 
The last thing I need to add to this post is to explain why I would cross voids to build this- the easiest way to explain would be a tutorial on the classic emu filter morph. Because morphing is what the classic z-plane EMU sound was built on. To add this lost capability using solely open source material to a modular environment like Axoloti would be just awesome:

              <p>Yeah Im still hoping the sythesis side of LORIS would be do-able.</p>

<p>Interesting on the actual EMU method - I hadn't looked to closely due to the patent but I can see how its much more efficient. That ARMAdillo table is just genius really.</p>

              <p>I think your describing crossfade... </p>

<p>the other approach (afaik, and what I think Loris is doing) is to analyse the frequency content of the two input signals, and then mix these by reconstructing using additive synthesis.</p>

<p>id assume this is computation expensive, I guess you need to do an FFT of the two signals, and then additive synthesis is expensive since you need N sines waves. I did consider these  fleeting when we were discussing wavetables... which seemed manageable since your just doing waves (quite small, a one cycle), not long samples.<br>I guess with samples you have to chop it up into tiny bits and do this for each section.<br>BUT ... this is a complete guess, as never studied it.... so Im sure LORIS can does a lot more that this. (I think its derived off a PhD project, so not simple stuff <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> )</p>

<p>Ive not looked at LORIS in any detail but ....<br>in general porting C code is not difficult (assuming its not using IO etc), the issue is more likely is...<br>is it going to be useable once ported? or does it use too much CPU / memory? <br>... also can it be optimised to use NEON?<br>is it even realistic to run this on a STM32F4?
