    <title>[PATCH] Novation Circuit-style chromatic layout for Launchpad Pro (prev. gen.)</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/patch-novation-circuit-style-chromatic-layout-for-launchpad-pro-prev-gen/6621</link>
    <description>i bought Novation Circuit recently, and found its chromatic layout very convenient for many purposes, except for 2 octaves is never enough. 

so i made this patch for Launchpad Pro (previous generation) to use it with any device. 

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/0/094149e2d0b59b86ff76e492ba46900847fcec0a.jpg&quot; width=&quot;499&quot; height=&quot;499&quot;&gt;

root notes are highlighted, 4ths and 5ths are slightly highlighted. 

this patch is made in 1.0.12 and won&#39;t work with 2.0.

this patch assumes that LP Pro is plugged into USB. notes are transmitted via DIN by default. other destination ports (internal or USB device port) may be selected inside the subpatch. 
(connecting LP Pro via DIN ports is technically possible, but requires different procedure of sending SysEx, so i did not implement it for now.)

to define your root note (default is C), press Note button and then desired note anywhere in the pad area. 
to shift octave range (±4 octaves), use Up &amp; Down keys.

some pads at the extremes are out of range (corresponding notes would be &lt;0 or &gt;127). such notes won&#39;t be transmitted, and no pad activity visual feedback will occur on pad press, however those pads are not visually distinct in any other way for now.

MIDI channels are switched and indicated by the bottom button row, default channel is 1. MIDI channel range (1-8 or 9-16) is switched by Device button in the upper button row.

unused (dark purple) pads do nothing in this patch, they are highlighted for future use. (i&#39;m planning to use these pads to control arpeggiator parameters.)
