        <p>According to page 3 of the <a href="http://www.axoloti.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/axoloti-core-sch-v12.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">schematic</a>, it's a side-view green LED with a 2.2V forward voltage (Vf) and it's very, very small. Anything similar with same Vf will do, but it's designed to be seen from the side. A not-so-small smd LED could be soldered on it's side (rather than flat as normal) to achieve the same thing probably, the pads look wide enough to accommodate something bigger. I don't know where you live and might order from, but cheap smd LEDs are available from eBay (<a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/50-pcs-SMD-SMT-0603-Super-bright-GREEN-LED-lamp-Bulb-GOOD-QUALITY/181847007394?epid=2213365186&amp;hash=item2a56ed20a2:g:L5MAAOSw3oBTyPPa" rel="nofollow noopener">example</a>). You could order from a proper distributor like Digikey, Mouser, RS... but there are minimum order quantities and shipping costs.</p>

<p>The orange thing that also got bashed is a capacitor (looking at my board I think it's C65 and the working of the Axoloti should be ok.) Otherwise, don't worry if everything else is working!</p>
