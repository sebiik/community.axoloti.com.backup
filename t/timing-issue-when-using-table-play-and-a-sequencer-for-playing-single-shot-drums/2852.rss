    <description>Hello!

Since the wave/play doesn&#39;t have a pitch function I have been trying to use the table/play to playback single drum shots. But I ran into some really weird timing issues.

See picture:
The sequencer selects which sample is selected 001-064. But the problem is that when the sequencer reaches the higher numbered samples, like 048, 064, etc. the clock timing slows down, radically. It is almost like the value of the sequencer affects how fast the clock is running. It starts of by playing fast and slows down as it reaches higher numbered values in the sequencer.

I have reproduced this issue with several kits of  64 single saved drums. If you have some single sounds saved as 001-064, then load them with the string/index and I am pretty sure you will get same result.

I tested that it is the same on 1.0.11, to make sure it isnt related to the new 1.0.12. I also tested exact same setup with wav/play and that works without any issues(but no pitch....). I also tested with removing the name in the string/index and then it plays at the same tempo. So it seems related to whatever is being loaded into the table/play.

This is really a mystery to me. Is there a technical explanation for it? Or might it be a bug? 

Argh, hard to explain.... Is this understandable? This is something that you have to test fr yourself to understand, cause it doesnt make any sense.....

ANY HELP APPRECIATED ;) 

@johannes?

<p>Thank you for suggesting making a new version, but from what you describe, I don't think it will do the trick, cause I often use a random modulation source to trigger different samples. It won't know before hand what comes next, so it is impossible to load it into a table.</p>

<p>Ah yeah I see the issue. That would take a lot of processing.</p>

<p>Guess I just have to rethink my idea. Maybe I could drag a bunch of samples into a daw and allign 64 drum hits after each other and export it as a single file and then load it into a table as a singe file instead of reloading the table with single shots, which is th cause of the problem. It takes a lot more preparation, but it could work.....</p>

<p>Any suggestions on how to achieve same goal, would be greatly appreciated <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>I could create a "threaded" version of <code>table/load</code>, that will do the job of loading the file into the table outside the audio computation deadline, but if you 'd trigger loading and play it, it will not be ready with loading yet, so playback will be glitchy. That could be circumvented by loading the next sample file while playing the current (assuming a non-existent "threaded" <code>table load</code> object), but would requires that the next sample file is already known while playing the current, and doing a "pingpong" game with 2 tables, one for playing and one for loading, and swapping the role of those between every sample, this would be painful to patch, better expressed in code. </p>

<p>Hey <a class="mention" href="/users/blindsmyth">@Blindsmyth</a>. </p>

<p>Yes, I find this very weird. It makes it impossible to use table/play as a sample player. Did you also do a test with samples? Or is you suggestion from looking at the picture?</p>

<p>If you didnt do the test and if you have some samples allready organised, would you be so kind of doin the test with samples? If you dunt have samples organised all ready, I can send some when I am home in the afternoon.</p>
