    <title>Official Axoloti boards - wow!</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/official-axoloti-boards-wow/233</link>
    <description>My production boards have arrived ... 4 of them, sonic power is mine :) 

I was fortunate to have the latest prototype for testing, hence Ive been able to &#39;dig in&#39; nice and early.

But I wanted to  just wanted to say a big thank you to @johannes for continuing to improve the hardware for Axoloti since it was announced and backed on Indiegogo. I think some campaigns would have just delivered what was promised, but Johanness didn&#39;t settle for that,  he continued to add more, at his own expense. 

We have USB device, a power port, more SDRAM, all of which make the board **much** more flexible and useful than what was promised on Indiegogo! ... and lets not forget its not just hardware, the software has much more  too (e.g its a USB class compliant device, a hope ,but not a promise at campaign time)

BUT... why Im posting today, is Ive been comparing the V0.5 prototype (the last one before production, I think), and its clear, even since then, Johannes has carried on development, there are a surprising number of changes if you look at the two boards side by side... and they make a real difference, the noise floor on the v1 board seems much lower, and the removal of USB ground loop hum is amazing (it wasn&#39;t bad on the prototype, but it was there). also there are header pins on X3/X4 :tada:
(and also some small things like labelling I/O pins on the underside of the board to help us in DIY, and Im no electrical engineer, so its only what i can see/hear.... I bet there are other changes too, that I don&#39;t recognise )

sure, we waited a little longer that the original date, but wow,  it was definitely worth the wait - its clear it was just to make sure it was &#39;just right&#39; before shipping!

In these days, where consumers expectations are (sometimes unrealistically) high, and patience is often short.
I want to say thank you to @johannes for exceeding expectations, and resisting the pressure to &#39;just ship it&#39;,  the care and attention you&#39;ve taken is obvious, and is really appreciated... and the axoloti platform will be much the better for it 

:beers:

Mark

(p.s. i know some don&#39;t have their boards yet... but Im sure it wont be long... and I hope you&#39;ll agree with my sentiments here)</description>
