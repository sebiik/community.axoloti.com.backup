        <p>My production boards have arrived ... 4 of them, sonic power is mine <img src="http://community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile"> </p>

<p>I was fortunate to have the latest prototype for testing, hence Ive been able to 'dig in' nice and early.</p>

<p>But I wanted to  just wanted to say a big thank you to <a class="mention" href="../../users/johannes.html">@johannes</a> for continuing to improve the hardware for Axoloti since it was announced and backed on Indiegogo. I think some campaigns would have just delivered what was promised, but Johanness didn't settle for that,  he continued to add more, at his own expense. </p>

<p>We have USB device, a power port, more SDRAM, all of which make the board <strong>much</strong> more flexible and useful than what was promised on Indiegogo! ... and lets not forget its not just hardware, the software has much more  too (e.g its a USB class compliant device, a hope ,but not a promise at campaign time)</p>

<p>BUT... why Im posting today, is Ive been comparing the V0.5 prototype (the last one before production, I think), and its clear, even since then, Johannes has carried on development, there are a surprising number of changes if you look at the two boards side by side... and they make a real difference, the noise floor on the v1 board seems much lower, and the removal of USB ground loop hum is amazing (it wasn't bad on the prototype, but it was there). also there are header pins on X3/X4 <img src="http://community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/tada.png?v=0" title=":tada:" class="emoji" alt="tada"><br>(and also some small things like labelling I/O pins on the underside of the board to help us in DIY, and Im no electrical engineer, so its only what i can see/hear.... I bet there are other changes too, that I don't recognise )</p>

<p>sure, we waited a little longer that the original date, but wow,  it was definitely worth the wait - its clear it was just to make sure it was 'just right' before shipping!</p>

<p>In these days, where consumers expectations are (sometimes unrealistically) high, and patience is often short.<br>I want to say thank you to <a class="mention" href="../../users/johannes.html">@johannes</a> for exceeding expectations, and resisting the pressure to 'just ship it',  the care and attention you've taken is obvious, and is really appreciated... and the axoloti platform will be much the better for it </p>

<p>Mark</p>

<p>(p.s. i know some don't have their boards yet... but Im sure it wont be long... and I hope you'll agree with my sentiments here)</p>
