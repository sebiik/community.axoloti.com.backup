    <title>Pd drum synth axoloti remake</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/pd-drum-synth-axoloti-remake/5973</link>
    <description>Hi! 
I found this video on youtube showing a Pd patch trying to recreate acoustic drum sounds:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpC3t1EVF_Q

I think these sounds are quite impressive, so I&#39;d like to do something similar with the axoloti - but I&#39;m not familiar with Pd at all. I had a look at the patches (https://github.com/MikeMorenoAudio/pd-mkmr/tree/master/06-Instruments, the &quot;mymembrane&quot; ones) and asked the guy who made them how it works. It seems to be one cycle of a sine wave and some filtered noise going through an allpass filter and then into a short delay line.

So here&#39;s what I put together:
&lt;a class=&quot;attachment&quot; href=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/0/099fbdbf423adb62ecc5bb87947863c32c0899dc.axp&quot;&gt;3Test_drum.axp&lt;/a&gt; (7.9 KB)

It makes some okay percussion sounds, but doesn&#39;t sound nearly as natural as in the Pd patch. Maybe someone who&#39;s also familiar with pd can help to get closer?</description>

              <p>Mike Moreno is VERY good at physical modelling stuff in PD. </p>

<p>Most realistic sounds I have hear so far. </p>

<p>He has many cool instruments.</p>

<p>Will check out your patch in the weekend, thanks <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
