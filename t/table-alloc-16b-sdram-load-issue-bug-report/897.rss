    <description>Hey guys :) 

After having issues with the table/alloc 16b sdram load for a long time and still have, even after it has been updated a few times.

Check this test. Where I use the table/alloc 16b sdram on the left side and on the right side table/alloc 16b sdram load. The table/alloc 16b sdram(left) goes live every time, but disconnects when I go &quot;unlive&quot;. The table/alloc 16b sdram load(right) does not connect even once.

Before recording the test I made another test and actually came to the conclusion that there is something with the table/alloc 16b sdram load object and using samples from folders.. I first tested one sample which I had in the root of the sd card and in a folder... The one from the root loaded everytime and the one in the folder didnt load at all.... But then I tried to recreate it and, then the sample in the root didnt work either.... All samples etc. are tested in other patches with the table/alloc 16b sdram and they work with that object.

ALso I see the The table/alloc 16b sdram load has now got bigger sample size 4 million something..... That feature would be great to get updated in the  table/alloc 16b sdram too, since the table/alloc 16b sdram load can be a little bit troublesome.

Or am I doing something wrong here?

I am on OSX Yosemite on a 2012 mid Macbook.</description>
