    <title>Changing Axoloti&#39;s Sample Rate?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/changing-axolotis-sample-rate/4816</link>
    <description>Hi there,

I was looking over the &quot;Creating AXO objects&quot; thread (http://community.axoloti.com/t/creating-axo-objects/481) and the author mentions in passing:
&gt; Sample rates are defined in the firmware app/firmware/axoloti_defines.h
&gt; The sample rate is defined by the macro SAMPLERATE.
&gt; The number of audio samples corresponding to one control rate sample is defined by the macro BUFSIZE , so a buffersize 16 results a krate of 48000/16 = 3000.

Since I&#39;m in the process of coding a poly-synth that is eating up CPU resources, this made me wonder if all I had to do to lower the sample rate is to lower the number at the end of the line:
&gt; .#define SAMPLERATE 48000

from axoloti_defines.h? This seems way too easy to change something so central to how Axoloti functions, so since I&#39;m still new to coding I thought I&#39;d ask here before I tried something that messed up my board. 

Anyways, the gist of my question is, Is it possible to change Axoloti&#39;s sample rate? And if so, is it as simple as changing the SAMPLERATE definition in axoloti_defines.h or (as I suspect) is it a much more involved process?</description>

  <blockquote>
    Axoloti is fixed to 48k sample rate. Im wondering, what code is dependent upon this, and how hard-coded it is. 

my thoughts are: oscillators - presumably the driving phasor depends upon sample rate. or at least its 'tuning reference' i.e. the dials/MTOF, all set the phasor to a frequency which gives the expected output. 

filters - highest frequency, would need to be nyquist which changes (SR/2) is there anything else that needs to be adjusted due to nyquist? 

control rate dependancies - anythâ€¦

<p>summary, no you cant just change that definition and it all work <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
