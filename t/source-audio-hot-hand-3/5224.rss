    <title>Source Audio Hot Hand 3</title>

    <description>Hi there,

i have been connecting a hot hand 3 receiver to the axoloti via a 4 pole 3.5mm jack. the wiring is here:

https://www.talkbass.com/threads/hothand-pin-layout.852379/

so basically you supply 3.3v and gnd and get a wireless two axis controller back (3 but only 2 at a time available over the analog lines)

this thing really rocks for dubstep bass! i am still adapting the axoloti software side to accommodate for different fx controls (on/off, gradual etc.)

so if you see a used one of these pick them up!

also i would be very interested if somebody on here has a hot hand usb (a usb midi device that pairs with a hot hand ring) and could tell me if there are any latency issues with that. the hot hand 3 receiver directly to the analog ins of the axoloti works great and has no latency issues at all, but the usb solution would be nice for the future maybe.</description>

<p>hi there,

does anybody know the pinlayout of the hothand receiver or the hothand daisychain cable? it has 4 pins and so far i found out that pins are...</p>
