    <title>Advanced Gliding Help</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/advanced-gliding-help/4923</link>
    <description>Hi! 

I&#39;m taking a note from a midi keyboard, then calculating a note higher than it and a note lower than it. This is fine, but THEN I want to be able to glide between the new high note and the new low note. With each new keypress I want to jump immediatly to the high pitch then glide to the low pitch (with the glide time controlled by another dial elsewhere - but looking at the glide objects I&#39;ve found, this bit will be the easy bit).

The thing I&#39;m struggling with is how to tell the glide object two notes at same time and that it should interpolate from high to the low, regardless of where it&#39;d got to previously... can anyone help?</description>

              <p>ok, I can only speak of the factory object , math/glide , as no idea what community objects do <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>but you don't need to give two values to a glide, it glides from where it currently is, to the new value supplied , with the time given. (math/glide uses an exp curve for this)</p>

<p>usually use is just to put it in front of the oscillator pitch... </p>

<p>it doesn't care about high/low , </p>

<p>if you want this logic, then you need to keep the previous value, and then compare it, use that into a mux to decide if you want to use the gliding value, or the value directly.<br>note: theres a little bit of 'additional complexity' , since you only want this check to happen on receipt of note_on, i.e gate transition, but I'll leave you to play with that <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>(its quite an interesting thing for you to 'solve', as it'll teach you something about 'conditional' logic in dsp, and the way that its not if/then/else like in normal programming, rather opening 'gates' to the required signal flow - which is why mux is such an important object)</p>
