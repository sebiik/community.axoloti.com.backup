    <title>Knobs! More knobs!</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/knobs-more-knobs/6702</link>
    <description>Hi everyone! Been a while since I&#39;ve played with my Axoloti and since I&#39;m stuck at home right now I decided to get back into the hobby!

I made a gigantic breakout board(s) thing with 32 potentiometers (kbobs) to control the Axoloti. The results were great! Nice, stable connections with little-to-no noise. 

One half of it connects directly to the Axoloti. The other is a custom made midi controller which adds a solid 16 pots. I could have added 16 switches or buttons but figured this version needs to be simple so I can understand what I would (and did) get wrong

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d5de16731b3331d53e93693e9eef253a6f5450b4.jpg&quot; width=&quot;375&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;


A couple years ago I did a very similar project but the connections were made with home made ribbon cables which were flimsy and noisy and time consuming to make so I decided to just make one huge board with all the bells ans whistles...

...only to find out that its REALLY expensive to do that soooo I decided to just break up the board into small modules and then stitch them all together at home...takes about 20 minutes and saves about $500 or something like that.

bah anyways, here&#39;s a peek at what I&#39;m working on. I need to fix some measurements and I plan on adding LEDs, Switches and a bunch of gpio ins and outs to allow for multiple axolotis to be connected to each other resulting in super crazy powerful synth goodness! 

If anyone is interest I&#39;ll likely have about 4 extra hats available...I could throw them up on etsy or something!


Here&#39;s a video of the hat in action...it looks janky but it works surprisingly well.

Next version Im working on will fix some measurement issues and make things a lot tighter......I have a few dozen slide potentiometers coming in the mail and when they arrive I&#39;m totally going to add them into the mix</description>

              <p>I'd be willing to sell them for $15 Canadian if you wanna self assemble them. Not sure what shipping would be but I could figure that out.</p>

<p>If i assemble them myself then I guess I'd have to charge more for the Potentiometers and time it would take to put them together...this wouldnt be much but I think it would make shipping way tricker</p>
