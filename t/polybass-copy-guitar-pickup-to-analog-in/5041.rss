    <title>Polybass copy / guitar pickup to analog in</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/polybass-copy-guitar-pickup-to-analog-in/5041</link>
    <description>Hey there I want to create a copy of this:

http://www.polybass.com/

What this does it takes the output from a guitar hex pickup (per string pickup) and creates a subbass from the lowest note played.

I want to this with the lowest three strings on axoloti. So always the lowest played note is converted to pitch and feeds an oscilator. 

I want to do this preferably with 1 audio Input. So my Idea was to hook up all three string pickus to relays and analog pins, to see which strings are being played. Then there would be a priority system in Axoloti always chossing the lowest played string. This would control either 3 relays or vactrols via the analog outputs so that only the lowest played string is fed into axoloti.

In order to achieve this here the practical part:

Can hook up the output of guitar pickup to an analog pin directly? Would a protection circuit like this be needed and work?

For the pickups there is two choices:
Self wound single coils with a Voltage output in the milivolt range.

Roland Gk2 active output, output Voltage unknown.</description>

<p>I'm a real noob with this electronics stuff. So just a 3.3V zener is enough to clip all voltages to a 0-3.3V range? <br>In the example you send me there is still -0,7V going through, or is that dependend on the diode you use?</p>

<p>For 6.5V CV from the GK pot I built a simple voltage divider using two resistors. Works like a charm. I want to add diode protection here too though, just to be shure.</p>

<p>Officially the GK takes 7V but seems to be working fine on 9v.</p>

<p>The Bass patch works great so far, although I need to work on my priority/string detection logic.</p>

<p>Next will be to use the pot and the swtiches on the GK to do Subbass volume and patch changes.</p>

<p>I measured that the pot puts out 6.5V when open. Way too much for axoloti. How would I scale this down?<br>I found this in the Euxoloti thread. Would it work for this application? Does anybody know which value r3 has to have for scaling down 6,5V to 3V?<br><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/e/edffaaf55603a9f5123e9f0743a2d3ca36696de1.jpg" width="570" height="256"></p>

<p>but an analog in per fret seems like a waste. better to go one analog in per string. then connect resitors between each fret and so you get a different reading for every fret you press down. (that's how it is done in commercial products) hmm, but multiple strings on the same fret pressed down could be an issue then...(again, what commercial products mostly use, except for frettrax, but they have no open string detection as of now, no velocity)</p>

              <p>Maybe, maybe not, there are a few different type attempts, you can get good enough monophonic results without dividing the fret. But they seem to get mixed results when wanting to use the pickup as well.<br>My thoughts are kind of towards, lets say for example the guitar is plugged directly into the Axo, so the guitars ground and Axo are now linked. But the guitar ground wire will have a 1k resister on it. Resister differential is added to the strings at the guitar head so the voltage is split to different levels by the resistors down each string. Each fret is connected to an analog input. So when no string is press against a fret, they are all grounded, but when the string connects to the fret, the signal follows the path of less resistance send a voltage level to the analog inputs, therefore giving a reading of fret and string. And at the same time, the audio is still going into the Axo for normal play etc..<br>Well its just an idea for now... <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/thinking.png?v=5" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:"></p>

<p>One thing I was reading about last night, was a few attempts people have made to use the guitar string and frets as a switch trigger. The problem they all seem to have is setting up with the switch trigger as well as the normal pickups running at the same time. There must be a way around it somehow. I am wondering whether there is a way of taking advantage of the normal guitar grounding as part of the signal flow rather then isolating like most do.<br><img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/grin.png?v=5" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>

<p>sounds like fun! probably easier to directly hook the led output to a digital in. note though, that latency will again be horrible, the tuner is not optimised for speed. also, you don't get the correct octave from the led, but maybe that is not important. do you mean a real old tuner, with a hand (like on an old stereo or something) or what makes you think it is analog?</p>

<p>very definitely. the gk pick up a LOT of harmonics, since they are so close to the bridge. again, i have done this in puredata land with six audio channels. what you want for your approach is some heavy filtering and you set the cutoff based on the analog input readings. i would suggest a cutoff around the 10th fret of the played string. it should be easy to switch the lp filter frequency if you get consistent readings from the analog ins.</p>

<p>Problem is I'm not a programmer and never worked with arduino so teensy is a bit undoable for me. Some of my friends are looking into the pitch detection on the teensy though.</p>

<p>If that would work I could do pitch detection + other sensors on teensy and hook it up to axoloti for the sound generation.</p>

<p>OK I get your point. But once I have the voltage of the signals fed to the analog pin I could do everything in patching right? Like the envelope follower you suggest for example.</p>

<p>I want to hook up the pickups to the pins only to check if there is activity --&gt; if the note is beeing played. That's why I wonder wich kind of circuitry I need in order to do that.</p>

<p>Then according to that only the lowest note of the 3 pickups should be let through.</p>

<p>I use a lot of inversions, so maybe this not the best aproach?</p>

<p>I know this will work but this is supposed to be part of a 2 board looper fx setup, so I want to keep the amount of axoloti boards low. </p>

<p>And I think the circuitry involved shouldnt be too crazy. I only need some protection for pins or am I wrong here?</p>

<p>I've been trying to make a polyphonic pitch detector, but with limited results and quite a high cpu-use (worked quite well with sines, but screwed up when input became 6 complex waves at once). But I think some sort of poly-pitch detector should be able to bring you where you want. Perhaps you do a limited poly-pitch-detect with a cross-over filter and then put a pitch-detector over each band.</p>
