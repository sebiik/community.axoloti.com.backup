    <title>The Holy Grail ? (second reprise)</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/the-holy-grail-second-reprise/2996</link>
    <description>Hi guys

I recently posted an earlier version of the text below but put it in the hardware catagory, which probably wasn&#39;t the best spot. I still got a few interesting reactions but this catagory might be the better place to find some people with actual programming skills.

So here I go again:

What I am dreaming of is an instrument that can use samples, say WAV´s, and then ¨mangle¨ them in any way possible via a physical modeling environment. One could see it as a 3 step system.

1 – A driver section based on sample input and processing or treatment. A full additive re-synthesis system would of course be preferable but since that is difficult to implement (Only the Alchemy VST seems to go the whole route) a granular sample treatment will be a very reasonable alternative. I have seen a few Axoloti trials in this direction but cannot find proof of anybody truly cracking that nut in Axoloti yet.

2 – A physical modeling resonator section to superimpose real time expression onto the sampled drivers created in section 1. That might sound like a tall order but much earlier machines have provided such facilities on the basis of wave guide modelling, so by using delays to create a response that is similar to a resonator body. If a whole bag of such treatment &quot;filters&quot; with limited tweakability would be available one could simply chose from them. For instance: a wooden body, a metal pipe, a drum head. Stuff like that. In this way one does not have to use a fully modeled variable resonator, so it is cheating a bit, but it would probably make a physcial modeling implementation in Axoloti much easier.

3 – Not totally necessary but preferably still: A conventional subtractive section to further shape envelopes, add LFO modulations, do some filter finetuning, etc. But since Axolotie provides all these facilities already I see no problems here.

For an impression of I what direction I am thinking see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiT117i6YnE&amp;t=23s6
Other examples would be the Roland V-synth or the ultra rare Technos Acxel (but both then with physical modeling options added). One could also say that I am dreaming of a Technics WSA1 with added resynhtesis or granular user sampling.

Are there community members who would be prepared to develop the coding for section 1 and 2 building blocks/ facilities? The above instrument concept is of course rather specific but I am sure that any such additions would also benefit many other users.

This is all very exiting so I hope you guys like my idea&#39;s!

<p>This is basically my idea(l) put in overdrive. Ah well, at least the Axoloti is way cheaper. About 1/30 including shipping! <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/sweat.png?v=5" title=":sweat:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat:"></p>

<p>In the mean time the polyphony nut has been cracked (see "Poly Power User Tips" and "Free Yamaha CS80" posts). So it's high time to crack the granular nut. In the mean time I have also been building a custom enclosure. More about that in a separate post soon.</p>

              <p>Man, AXOLOTI rules!</p>

<p>I've at last build my first Axoloti instrument. It is basically a version of the above concept with conventional single waveform "analog" oscillators (sine, saw, PWM, noise).</p>

<p>The parallel use of an effects section as a resonator works very much like I expected, even tough I have until now only tried out the standard reverb effect! It however already is a great synth now while it only (?) uses 35 % of the processing power in it's monophonic form. Does anybody have an idea what sort of polyphony one can then expect?</p>

<p>The next steps will be:<br>1 - to find out how to replace the oscillators with one of the available granulators<br>2 - to find out how to make it work polyphonically.</p>

<p>I know, I know. A piece of cake for all you old experts out there but I could surely still use a few step by step tips because the more basic an operation is the poorer it seems to be documented. So can anybody out there PLEASE point me into the right direction? <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/sob.png?v=5" title=":sob:" class="emoji" alt=":sob:"></p>

<p>Hi Guys,</p>

<p>I've at last found time to turn back to the Axoloti again. Mine is actually fully runnig ny now! hurray!</p>

<p>Now I'd like to take this thread back to my initial intentions. I have namely refined my thinking about how to implement the original idea into the Axoloti</p>

<p>Bascially I have, also thanks to all your inputs, come to 3 main conclusions:</p>

<p>1 - As already expected from the start pure resynthesis is a very difficult proposition. Granular sampling however forms a good, practical alternative since Axoloti already offers solutions for that.</p>

<p>2 - A very interesting insight was triggered by <a class="mention" href="/u/sirsicksik">@SirSickSik</a> (if I remember correctly). He said that creating resonator responses for the Axoloti environment would be very time consuming. So I wondered which solution could be constructed form more standard components. What is a resonator actually? Normally it exists of an algorithm that imitates then complex echo response of a virbrating body. The specific character is then obtained from recreating the typical overtones / fixed harmonics of such an acoustic environment. Basically we are however always talking about a sort of short delay / reverb trail. So why not use flexible delay / fx processor setup in stead? Then one will actually be able to shape his own "responses" on the spot. One can compare it it to doing Karplus Strong modeling and impuls synthesis approximations on an analog modular synth.</p>

<p>3 - to come to a really managable solution a menu driven hardware interface would be preferable. To get in impression of the possibilities I have actually started up a new discussion see the <strong>hardware interface concept question</strong> thread. <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/hardware-interface-concept-question/3884">http://community.axoloti.com/t/hardware-interface-concept-question/3884</a></p>

<p>The pictures below reflect my present insights (working title: Grailer One. Geddit?):</p>

<p>The sketch above shows my initial concept for a general programming tool. It combines a bunch of submenu selection swtiches and 4 general prameter controls and layout for a sort of advanced loopable envelope generator / LFO combination (working title BrassEG). Note that this layout can be connected to the Axoloti's 5 digital and 15 analog inputs. The afformentioned additional discussion focusses on the possibilitiy of implementing such a solution.</p>

<p>If this does not work one can of course come up with a layout that "only" takes care of 20 parameters/ setting throughout the whole setup and still do the rest via the computer screen. Do however please note that my solution focusses on a general hardware controller with 5 switches 7 pots and 8 sliders, which would be a very nice general solution anyway (so also for other Axoloti instruments).</p>

<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/c8d1ed8bd10f21586b5b8c6d4a5d150a81c341af" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c8d1ed8bd10f21586b5b8c6d4a5d150a81c341af.jpg" class="lightbox" title="Grailer One parameter matix.jpg"><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c8d1ed8bd10f21586b5b8c6d4a5d150a81c341af_1_555x500.jpg" width="555" height="500"><div class="meta">
<span class="filename">Grailer One parameter matix.jpg</span><span class="informations">1885x1696 821 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>
</div></a></div></p>

<p>This is a quick stab at a possible parameter matrix as assigned to the 4 parameter pots per section/page.</p>

<p>I hope this stuff inspires you guys a bit as well.</p>

<p>I know, I know.  Of course it is still not clear if a polyphonic model of such an instrument can be run on a single Axoloti, especially with the additional demand of a menu driven system added to it,  but we'll see. Dreaming (still) costs nothing and a reduced version of the concept must always be possible. For instance a monophonic version without a menu driven user matrix.</p>

<p>Please let me know what you think.</p>

<p>Marc</p>

<p>I have at last installed the software on my PC, started up the Axoloti and am now getting to grips with the programming interface. I've just been way too buzy with other stuff during the last half year.</p>

<p>Furthermore this is my first serious attempt to use a computer based musical solution since years. Normally I only work with user-dedicated hardware systems. They might be just as digital below the surface but one does not have to concern oneself too much with typical computer issues. It for instance took me hours to hunt down a double Male USB connector cable to only find out that the Axoloti actually communicates via / is fed by the micro USB connector. Stuff like that. <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/confounded.png?v=5" title=":confounded:" class="emoji" alt=":confounded:"></p>

<p>But like I already said on YouTube: This should be a good starting point to actually create my first own model.</p>

              <p>A tiny parcel arrived today, and inside the box was, IMHO, the most amazing little device you can add your SCSI retro synth gear!</p>

<p>I was discussing with Jaffa about that USB Floppy Emulator, but then I thought to myself, I wonder if there's such a thing as SCSI to SD card adaptor yet?  I did check years back but they were non-existent at the time, but that's no longer the case!  I found this SCSI to SD Card adapter, which basically turns an SD Card into a SCSI Hard Drive with all the benefits that come with SD, including no moving parts, and complete silence!</p>

<p>And because it's designed for internal installation, it means you get to keep the original Floppy Drive in your gear as well, which is good, cause a floppy can hold 8 bars of music at 44.KHz stereo - and it's just nice to be able to pick out a floppy with a label on it.</p>

<p>So anyway, installed it without a problem, worked first time, absolute luxury <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/heart_eyes.png?v=5" title=":heart_eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":heart_eyes:"></p>

<p>I purchased it from an Amiga dealer, and if you look at the reviews for the product on their site, you'll notice people commenting who have installed it in all sorts of retro synth and sampler gear.  Akai, Roland, Yamaha etc.  Really is awesome, cannot recommend it highly enough!</p>

<p>Anyway, thought it might also be of interest to Marc and ST since you're into keeping the retro gear alive.</p>

              <p>Yeah, the exampels I described are actually proof of how near an S-series can come to a CS80 (however much sacrilege that remark might be to many people). It's more that I made the CS80 sample pool just in case the real thing becomes unavailable to me. So it woudl be nice if I could then also include these samples into my setup's arsenal.</p>

<p>Come to think of it. The Axoloti could also do that.</p>

<p>By the way: I have even come so close to the CS80 on the Technics WSA that I coudl even fool myslef if I had't programmed the sounds myself. So the amtter becomes ever more arbitrary.</p>

<p>But still: Do not underestimate those CS80 waveforms as such. The CS has very specific, so called "charged pump"oscillators that give it a rather distinct sound. It's not always only the filters that do it, you know. I am sure soem very specific sounds will still be difficult to make on another platform.</p>

<p>Hm, what about an Axoloti CS-emulator. Not the sort of retro-project I'd go for myself but it could be a nice technical challenge for some of the programmer dudes out there. One would for intance need the very Yamaha specific 5-stage envelope generators for the filters.</p>

<p>No who said that this sort of babbling cannot feed back possitive idea's into the Axoloti user-community.</p>

<p>It might be a good idea to access the A3000's Test Mode and do a Factory Reset just in case the previous user set or disabled anything in a menu somewhere, or you need to reset it after screwing something up.</p>

<p>To do a Factory Reset:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hold down the <strong>Program</strong> and <strong>Audition</strong> buttons while powering it up.</li>
<li>Use the left-most encoder to scroll through the various tests until you see <strong>Full Reset</strong>.</li>
<li>Push the encoder under where it says <strong>Automatic</strong>.</li>
<li>Push the encoder under where it says <strong>Yes</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's a whole bunch of stuff hidden in there, hardware tests, memory wiping etc.</p>

<p>I'm not sure you need some waveforms to get a BladeRunner sound or some other CS80 famous sound. <br>I obtained very nice results by using the first filter as a highpass without resonance and the second with mid resonance and <strong>pressure control</strong>. The character of this bloody filter makes the detuned sawteeth sound great (especially with slight pitch deviations thanks to the looped envelopes).<br>Sadly, the Gem S does not support SysEx Dumps ! (or rather it is not documented and readily available from the synth). So i can't link a MIDI file for you to try my patch.</p>

<p>As far as I understood the Gem S turbo uses a special 1.62Mb format for the setup/presets floppies but it can read MS/DOS 1.44Mb floppies to import wavs and Akai format. The subtype of wav is not really clear to me (you know, the number of bytes per sample, big or little endian issues... i read that it is signed 16 bit little endian mono). I think that maybe you can find some software that handles Akai format.</p>

<p>It seems that sample dump by MIDI (SDS) is possible. </p>

<p>If you have (lots of) time, maybe you can have a look to <a href="https://github.com/jmechnich/s3turbo">https://github.com/jmechnich/s3turbo</a></p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/jaffasplaffa">@jaffasplaffa</a>,  It seems that the 1.62Mb format can be an issue for some USB stick emulators... so i'm very interested in further experiments.</p>

              <p>Dear Smasho,</p>

<p>Yep: findign the quick step to the poly aftertouch was also a bit of a bore to me and it alwys take sa few keyabstroeks but boy is it woth it.</p>

<p>Automatically configuring it floppy-less is indeed a good idea.</p>

<p>Sounds like you already went deeper into it then I did anyway. My main task for it also is to use it as a polyphonic aftertouch generating MIDI keyboard for the Strarship One but it should serve the Axoloti equally well.</p>

<p>If one uses it's internal sounds the reponse is however even more direct and really on a par with that of the Yamaha CS80.</p>

<p>An example: I did all the brassy bits in part 1 of my Zamsidat Suite (<a href="http://www.brassee.com/electronicmusic.html#zamisdat" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.brassee.com/electronicmusic.html#zamisdat</a>.) I pumped it out in one improvised go but it all sounds so measured and controlled that it gives the impression of somehting fully orchestrated. Now that is the sort of exprssion I am looking for.</p>

<p>Another very good example is foctory Performance B2; ThinShocks. The response is so fine one can actaully make a conventional analog type sound move in an almost vocal-like way. That's alwys alwys a very good measure of a synths potential.</p>

<p>Maybe you could help me out: I have not yet worked out how to actually load WAV's into the S-series, although I have prepared a complete set of CS80 samples in WAV (3 samples per octave, per waveform, etc.).</p>

<p>There's a guy on ebay sells the V2 ROM if you cannot find a Yamaha branded one.  Just bear in mind that you won't get the extra user manual that comes with the official Yamaha upgrade.  If you're curious as to what you get in V2, you can see these two reviews for comparison.

<p>Regards the Floppy Emulator, thanks, and yes that looks the same, but I'm not ordering from China if I can help it, I might as well just pay the extra and get it from the UK a lot quicker.  Thanks for the heads-up about not needing to flash it for the A3000, that's a relief, makes it plug'n'play!</p>

<p>I think the same as you found, just a bit cheaper:</p>

<p>Well a friend of mine bought one for an old school 8-bit sampler, Ensoniq Mirage. He had to flash it before using it. And his set up seemed to work perfectly. That sampler, the Ensoniq has got some character to it <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  But for the A3000, from what I understood there is no need for flashing it for A3000.</p>

<blockquote><p>Yup, it's definitely a weirdo sampler, lol, but it's power makes up for it (it's crazy powerful).

<p>Yes super powerful. Maybe I will use it as sample also when I actually get it working.</p>

<p>I just installed it and it seems to light up as supposed, now I just need to test with some samples, which is next step. Hopefully everything works. I'll keep you updated.

<p>I meant to reply to this yesterday, so just in case any of my own adventures of installing Axoloti has put you off a bit, really, don't let it.  Axoloti was actually quite painless to install on my other machine, and even then, I was one of the unlucky ones cause I had to flash it before it would work.  When you come to install it, chances are it will just go as easy as installing any other peice of hardware - you pessimist <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Sounds like you have a faulty fan then, mine's nice and quiet, I can hear it but it's just a whisper!  I've not got a hard disk in mine, in fact a hard disk is the only feature I haven't bothered with.  I was extremely lucky when I got mine, She's completely 100% mint condition, not a single mark anywhere, still has the proctective film over the display even.  It's an official V2 ROM version as well, has every expansion board fitted, and the maximum amount of RAM.  I chose not to go for a hard disk when I saw those Floppy Emulator drives you just mentioned, much better, silent and no moving parts!  I just haven't gotten around to buying one yet.<br></p>

<p>Yup, it's definitely a weirdo sampler, lol, but it's power makes up for it (it's crazy powerful).  When you consider that it has a Parametric EQ for each individual sample, then a bunch of Parametric EQ's in each of the Multi-Effects blocks, three completely independent Aphex Aural Exciters, a Master Parametric and 24 Digital Filter types, it's quite a beast!</p>

<p>Here's a little tip to help you out there, one that will prove it's the OS and not the encoders (they're actually very high-grade encoders).  When it appears to go to sleep and stops responding, just stop twisting the knob and count to two, then try again and it will work perfectly.  Like I said, I'm pretty sure it's because the OS is doing something (probably some sort of house-keeping), but that's the best way to deal with that annoying encoder thing whenever it happens.<br></p>

<p>You got a bargain, and it would be crazy not to use it as a sampler.  I actually paid double that amount but like I said she's completely mint, V2, and has all the boards etc.  Other than me not installing the hard disk, she's "fully loaded" as they say <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>

<p>Cryptic, man you should see the Yamaha A3000 Sampler then, it brings a whole new meaning to the word "Cryptic".  I've only ever owned two samplers.  The first one was a Roland MC-808, which I really liked but returned it just days later after discovering it needed to be connected to a computer to fully edit the sounds.  I even left a message at the store for the Roland rep who was supposedly visiting later that day.  I told him, when I pay for a piece of hardware, I fully expect to be able to program the damn thing without having to drag a computer along!</p>

<p>Havnen't a clue if he passed the message on, but that's what I told him.</p>

<p>Later I ended-up with the Yamaha A3000 Sampler, which I still own.  Has the worst designed operating system I've ever seen, and while a lot of people claim the machine has horrible rotary encoders, personally, I'm convinced it's the operating system itself that is to blame, not the encoders.  it's so unresponsive sometimes that the encoders simply have no effect cause the OS seems to be busy doing something else.  I'm convinced that's what it is, anway.</p>

<p>Very powerful machine though, with three completely independent Multi-FX blocks, so works well as a super-powerful effects rackmount even if you never touched the sampler!</p>

              <p>Yeah, editing is cumbersome.</p>

<p>As far as file / preset management is concerned. Floppy's might be oldfashioned but if stuff works it works.</p>

<p>The S-series strength are actually it's synthesizer sounds. The typical nineties sample pool is good enough but layering rather obvious samples on top of each other becomes boring quite quickly. The way to get the best out of such machines usually is to use the layers to provide basic waveforms and then do your best (or worst) with al the other facilities. It's the classic less is more thing.</p>

<p>So my first tip is. Us the triangular cursors to the left of the display to select and mute the different layers in the preset user Performances. Pressing an arrow once selects a layer, pressing it agian mutes it.</p>

<p>By listening to the individual layers you really get a better impression of the quality of the sounds and their possibilities.</p>
