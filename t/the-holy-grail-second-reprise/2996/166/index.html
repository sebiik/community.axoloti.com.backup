        <p>Hi Smasho,</p>

<p>Sorry for not getting back to you on this one but I have been on holdiay and I make it a point to leave all media related devices at home.</p>

<p>Congrata with going for the S2. It's nice to have at least one convert <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p><code>Fun</code> fact: In 2015 I actually visited the region where allmost all Italian keyboards came from. It is called La Marche Italy. The only clear proof one could still find was the derelict GEM factory. It's big shame this industry died. Somebody has however recently bought the brand name and knowhow. So never say an Italian brand is totally dead.</p>

        <p>Like I said before. I'll have to get around to it first. Already dreading the moment when I have to work out all the complications of installing Axoloti does obviously not help but the main reason is that I am alwys working on a lot of stuff in a sort of intermitent, semi-paralell way. Some of you have seen my website. It still only shows the top of the iceberg. It only contians the stuff that got finished up to a certain standard and is (possibly) consumable for others.</p>

<p>I could give you a "still to do list" that would be as long as my arm, inlcuding a section about the status of my electonic instrument projects, but I conciously refrain form that because explaining everything on it would in itself alrady be an undertaking.</p>

<p>The good news however is that I normally always finish what I start (even if it might take 10 years or so to do so). I'll expect the winter will bring a new bout of music related activity. Ice winter stalactites hanging form my metal workshop's walls (think Transilvanian castlle surroundings) often help to drive me into the music laboratory (It's alive, I tell you!) providing autumn has not already done so. Sigh! <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/pensive.png?v=5" title=":pensive:" class="emoji" alt=":pensive:"></p>

        <p>Yeah, editing is cumbersome.</p>

<p>As far as file / preset management is concerned. Floppy's might be oldfashioned but if stuff works it works.</p>

<p>The S-series strength are actually it's synthesizer sounds. The typical nineties sample pool is good enough but layering rather obvious samples on top of each other becomes boring quite quickly. The way to get the best out of such machines usually is to use the layers to provide basic waveforms and then do your best (or worst) with al the other facilities. It's the classic less is more thing.</p>

<p>So my first tip is. Us the triangular cursors to the left of the display to select and mute the different layers in the preset user Performances. Pressing an arrow once selects a layer, pressing it agian mutes it.</p>

<p>By listening to the individual layers you really get a better impression of the quality of the sounds and their possibilities.</p>

<p>Cryptic, man you should see the Yamaha A3000 Sampler then, it brings a whole new meaning to the word "Cryptic".  I've only ever owned two samplers.  The first one was a Roland MC-808, which I really liked but returned it just days later after discovering it needed to be connected to a computer to fully edit the sounds.  I even left a message at the store for the Roland rep who was supposedly visiting later that day.  I told him, when I pay for a piece of hardware, I fully expect to be able to program the damn thing without having to drag a computer along!</p>

<p>Havnen't a clue if he passed the message on, but that's what I told him.</p>

<p>Later I ended-up with the Yamaha A3000 Sampler, which I still own.  Has the worst designed operating system I've ever seen, and while a lot of people claim the machine has horrible rotary encoders, personally, I'm convinced it's the operating system itself that is to blame, not the encoders.  it's so unresponsive sometimes that the encoders simply have no effect cause the OS seems to be busy doing something else.  I'm convinced that's what it is, anway.</p>

<p>Very powerful machine though, with three completely independent Multi-FX blocks, so works well as a super-powerful effects rackmount even if you never touched the sampler!</p>

        <p>Well, the only difficulty i had is to set on the polyphonic aftertouch. But once you get that it is organised around "tracks", its not difficult to configure it.<br>The RAM disc i installed is a plus compared to the slow floppies. This way, i just have to switch it on to have my MIDI setup running without any boot floppy in the driver.</p>

<p>I found the sound editing pages logically designed.</p>

<p>The internal samples sound standard to me: mostly similar to what you can have in a Emu of this era (Proteus I 1989).</p>

<p>The double filter is surprisingly good for a <strong><em>digital filter of the early 90s</em></strong> : it can be deeply modulated with high resonance.<br>It sounds much better than a Chamberlin filter - that was widely used in the <em>late 90s</em> - with its stability issues that forced to limit its modulation depth and/or resonance.<br>Maybe, they used the good old <em>step invariant transform</em>, the filter performances are consistent with this almost forgotten design.</p>

<p>There is only one LFO but, the envelopes can have a loop that makes them act like LFOs.</p>

<p>Well, now, i will use it with the Axoloti.<br>I will make some patches designed for it using attack and release velocities, poly aftertouch and the 7 sliders <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> .</p>

        <p><a class="mention" href="/u/axoman">@axoman</a> I got the Yamaha A3000 too. Been messing around with it a lot lately. Haven taken out the fan, whihc made it sound like a jetplane. I read that this was no problem and I havent had any problem with it. I also took out the harddisc, which made it sound like the was a second jetplane inside my house. </p>

<p>And I JUST got a floppy to USB-stick converter, to store patches on instead of the internal drive..... This is pretty nice, like 15€ i think it was. I just got it and going to try to install it tonight, hopefully it works <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> SO overall now I think it is in the best shape it has ever been <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>Oh.. I forgot about the knobs... Sometimes I have to turn them 4-5 rounds before they actually start to work....... Haha <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>So yeah I agree a lot it is a weirdo of a sampler. I also had a Akai sampler and an Emu sampler. Emu sampler was about the same as the a3000. VERY problematic. </p>

<p>But I think actually I am mostly just going to use it for the effects now, the A3000. As you say pretty decent effect section in it...</p>

<p>But I have actually only payed 30€ for it, so I dont complaint(too much) <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>I meant to reply to this yesterday, so just in case any of my own adventures of installing Axoloti has put you off a bit, really, don't let it.  Axoloti was actually quite painless to install on my other machine, and even then, I was one of the unlucky ones cause I had to flash it before it would work.  When you come to install it, chances are it will just go as easy as installing any other peice of hardware - you pessimist <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Sounds like you have a faulty fan then, mine's nice and quiet, I can hear it but it's just a whisper!  I've not got a hard disk in mine, in fact a hard disk is the only feature I haven't bothered with.  I was extremely lucky when I got mine, She's completely 100% mint condition, not a single mark anywhere, still has the proctective film over the display even.  It's an official V2 ROM version as well, has every expansion board fitted, and the maximum amount of RAM.  I chose not to go for a hard disk when I saw those Floppy Emulator drives you just mentioned, much better, silent and no moving parts!  I just haven't gotten around to buying one yet.<br></p>

<p>Yup, it's definitely a weirdo sampler, lol, but it's power makes up for it (it's crazy powerful).  When you consider that it has a Parametric EQ for each individual sample, then a bunch of Parametric EQ's in each of the Multi-Effects blocks, three completely independent Aphex Aural Exciters, a Master Parametric and 24 Digital Filter types, it's quite a beast!</p>

<p>Here's a little tip to help you out there, one that will prove it's the OS and not the encoders (they're actually very high-grade encoders).  When it appears to go to sleep and stops responding, just stop twisting the knob and count to two, then try again and it will work perfectly.  Like I said, I'm pretty sure it's because the OS is doing something (probably some sort of house-keeping), but that's the best way to deal with that annoying encoder thing whenever it happens.<br></p>

<p>You got a bargain, and it would be crazy not to use it as a sampler.

<p>I think the same as you found, just a bit cheaper:</p>

<p>Well a friend of mine bought one for an old school 8-bit sampler, Ensoniq Mirage. He had to flash it before using it. And his set up seemed to work perfectly. That sampler, the Ensoniq has got some character to it <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  But for the A3000, from what I understood there is no need for flashing it for A3000.</p>

<p>Yes super powerful. Maybe I will use it as sample also when I actually get it working.</p>

<p>I just installed it and it seems to light up as supposed, now I just need to test with some samples, which is next step. Hopefully everything works. I'll keep you updated.

        <p>If it's a V2 it will tease you on startup:</p>

<ul>
<li>First it'll say YAMAHA A3000 PROFESSIONAL SAMPLER V1</li>
<li>Then the 1 will scroll away and be replaced by a 2 so that it says V2.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's a guy on ebay sells the V2 ROM if you cannot find a Yamaha branded one.  Just bear in mind that you won't get the extra user manual that comes with the official Yamaha upgrade.  If you're curious as to what you get in V2, you can see these two reviews for comparison.  Good write-ups as well cause they're written by Chris Carter of TG, who originally wrote these for SoundOnSound:</p>

<p>Regards the Floppy Emulator, thanks, and yes that looks the same, but I'm not ordering from China if I can help it, I might as well just pay the extra and get it from the UK a lot quicker.  Thanks for the heads-up about not needing to flash it for the A3000, that's a relief, makes it plug'n'play!</p>

<p>You could let my know how it goes by PM if you want, but to be honest I doubt it would matter posting it here after all we've posted already!</p>

        <p>Dear Smasho,</p>

<p>Yep: findign the quick step to the poly aftertouch was also a bit of a bore to me and it alwys take sa few keyabstroeks but boy is it woth it.</p>

<p>Automatically configuring it floppy-less is indeed a good idea.</p>

<p>Sounds like you already went deeper into it then I did anyway. My main task for it also is to use it as a polyphonic aftertouch generating MIDI keyboard for the Strarship One but it should serve the Axoloti equally well.</p>

<p>If one uses it's internal sounds the reponse is however even more direct and really on a par with that of the Yamaha CS80.</p>

<p>An example: I did all the brassy bits in part 1 of my Zamsidat Suite (<a href="http://www.brassee.com/electronicmusic.html#zamisdat" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.brassee.com/electronicmusic.html#zamisdat</a>.) I pumped it out in one improvised go but it all sounds so measured and controlled that it gives the impression of somehting fully orchestrated. Now that is the sort of exprssion I am looking for.</p>

<p>Another very good example is foctory Performance B2; ThinShocks. The response is so fine one can actaully make a conventional analog type sound move in an almost vocal-like way. That's alwys alwys a very good measure of a synths potential.</p>

<p>Maybe you could help me out: I have not yet worked out how to actually load WAV's into the S-series, although I have prepared a complete set of CS80 samples in WAV (3 samples per octave, per waveform, etc.).</p>

        <p>OK. That floppy drive emulator is pleasantly cheap for such a nifty device. But how does one configure it? And what about compatibility and connectivity? Will it also fit in less regular machines like the Technics WSA and the GEM S-series? If so I'll probabaly still upgrade my setup.</p>

<p>I'm not sure you need some waveforms to get a BladeRunner sound or some other CS80 famous sound. <br>I obtained very nice results by using the first filter as a highpass without resonance and the second with mid resonance and <strong>pressure control</strong>. The character of this bloody filter makes the detuned sawteeth sound great (especially with slight pitch deviations thanks to the looped envelopes).<br>Sadly, the Gem S does not support SysEx Dumps ! (or rather it is not documented and readily available from the synth). So i can't link a MIDI file for you to try my patch.</p>

<p>As far as I understood the Gem S turbo uses a special 1.62Mb format for the setup/presets floppies but it can read MS/DOS 1.44Mb floppies to import wavs and Akai format. The subtype of wav is not really clear to me (you know, the number of bytes per sample, big or little endian issues... i read that it is signed 16 bit little endian mono). I think that maybe you can find some software that handles Akai format.</p>

<p>It seems that sample dump by MIDI (SDS) is possible. </p>

<p>If you have (lots of) time, maybe you can have a look to <a href="https://github.com/jmechnich/s3turbo">https://github.com/jmechnich/s3turbo</a></p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/jaffasplaffa">@jaffasplaffa</a>,  It seems that the 1.62Mb format can be an issue for some USB stick emulators... so i'm very interested in further experiments.</p>

        <p>Just a quick note to Jaffa ...</p>

<p>It might be a good idea to access the A3000's Test Mode and do a Factory Reset just in case the previous user set or disabled anything in a menu somewhere, or you need to reset it after screwing something up.</p>

<p>To do a Factory Reset:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hold down the <strong>Program</strong> and <strong>Audition</strong> buttons while powering it up.</li>
<li>Use the left-most encoder to scroll through the various tests until you see <strong>Full Reset</strong>.</li>
<li>Push the encoder under where it says <strong>Automatic</strong>.</li>
<li>Push the encoder under where it says <strong>Yes</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's a whole bunch of stuff hidden in there, hardware tests, memory wiping etc.</p>

        <p>Yeah, the exampels I described are actually proof of how near an S-series can come to a CS80 (however much sacrilege that remark might be to many people). It's more that I made the CS80 sample pool just in case the real thing becomes unavailable to me. So it woudl be nice if I could then also include these samples into my setup's arsenal.</p>

<p>Come to think of it. The Axoloti could also do that.</p>

<p>By the way: I have even come so close to the CS80 on the Technics WSA that I coudl even fool myslef if I had't programmed the sounds myself. So the amtter becomes ever more arbitrary.</p>

<p>But still: Do not underestimate those CS80 waveforms as such. The CS has very specific, so called "charged pump"oscillators that give it a rather distinct sound. It's not always only the filters that do it, you know. I am sure soem very specific sounds will still be difficult to make on another platform.</p>

<p>Hm, what about an Axoloti CS-emulator. Not the sort of retro-project I'd go for myself but it could be a nice technical challenge for some of the programmer dudes out there. One would for intance need the very Yamaha specific 5-stage envelope generators for the filters.</p>

<p>No who said that this sort of babbling cannot feed back possitive idea's into the Axoloti user-community.</p>

<p>Must admit, that album of yours I downloaded featuring the WSA did sound impressively analogue in parts!</p>

        <p>A tiny parcel arrived today, and inside the box was, IMHO, the most amazing little device you can add your SCSI retro synth gear!</p>

<p>I was discussing with Jaffa about that USB Floppy Emulator, but then I thought to myself, I wonder if there's such a thing as SCSI to SD card adaptor yet?  I did check years back but they were non-existent at the time, but that's no longer the case!  I found this SCSI to SD Card adapter, which basically turns an SD Card into a SCSI Hard Drive with all the benefits that come with SD, including no moving parts, and complete silence!</p>

<p>And because it's designed for internal installation, it means you get to keep the original Floppy Drive in your gear as well, which is good, cause a floppy can hold 8 bars of music at 44.KHz stereo - and it's just nice to be able to pick out a floppy with a label on it.</p>

<p>So anyway, installed it without a problem, worked first time, absolute luxury <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/heart_eyes.png?v=5" title=":heart_eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":heart_eyes:"></p>

<p>I purchased it from an Amiga dealer, and if you look at the reviews for the product on their site, you'll notice people commenting who have installed it in all sorts of retro synth and sampler gear.  Akai, Roland, Yamaha etc.  Really is awesome, cannot recommend it highly enough!</p>

<p>Anyway, thought it might also be of interest to Marc and ST since you're into keeping the retro gear alive.</p>

        <p>Dear <a class="mention" href="/u/servandisco">@servandisco</a></p>

<p>Thanks a lot.<img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/kissing_closed_eyes.png?v=5" title=":kissing_closed_eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":kissing_closed_eyes:"></p>

<p>I have at last installed the software on my PC, started up the Axoloti and am now getting to grips with the programming interface. I've just been way too buzy with other stuff during the last half year.</p>

<p>Furthermore this is my first serious attempt to use a computer based musical solution since years. Normally I only work with user-dedicated hardware systems. They might be just as digital below the surface but one does not have to concern oneself too much with typical computer issues. It for instance took me hours to hunt down a double Male USB connector cable to only find out that the Axoloti actually communicates via / is fed by the micro USB connector. Stuff like that. <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/confounded.png?v=5" title=":confounded:" class="emoji" alt=":confounded:"></p>

<p>But like I already said on YouTube: This should be a good starting point to actually create my first own model.</p>
