I recently posted an earlier version of the text below but put it in the hardware catagory, which probably wasn&amp;#39;t the best spot. I still got a few interesting reactions but this catagory might be the better pla&amp;hellip;">

        <p>Hi, thanks for watching my videos</p>

<p>That granular patch is actually one of the most loved patches when people pay around with my different boxes, and it gets a few questions on youtube too.<br>The patch in question is just a very small adaptation of <a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> patch that he has in the community patch folder called :  <strong>grainy-table (axoloti-contrib\patches\jt\grainy-table.axp)</strong><br>The pitch input responds very well to a keyboard pitch too and can even be polyphonic. You can use it with input or pre-recorded materials.<br>When you open up the patch, you realize how simple it is actually, and adjusting it to whatever you want not too difficult.<br>and it uses very little CPU too <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<blockquote><p>OK I just tried to look osc/MI up myself but could not find anyhting. So information overload! What the hell is a osc/MI and where can I orient myself on the subject? <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p></blockquote></aside>

<p><a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/clds-and-lmnts-objects/2916">this thread</a> has some discussion, but unless you have the patcher software installed (and really an axoloti board to play with it) , your lacking quite a lot of context.</p>

<p>fyi, MI = Mutable Instruments (not sure what the osc referred to <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">) <br>as I mentioned on the other thread, I think you main interest is elements, and possibly clouds....<br>you can find more info on these here : <a href="http://mutable-instruments.net">http://mutable-instruments.net</a></p>

<p>unlike the eurorack module, some parts of these modules are available separate e.g. tube/string/diffuser... and of course then there are reverbs/choruses/delays lines etc </p>

<p>as i said before though, this is easier to experiment with rather than talk about... axoloti has most of the parts that you talk about, but if they are sufficient for your needs only you will be able to tell.</p>

<p>yes, axoloti can deal with poly aftertouch, it can also deal with MPE which is what I use with my Eigenharps and Soundplane.</p>

        <p>Thanks Matthew,</p>

<p>If it works like a granulator type polyphonic sampler indeed it is about the last link I was looking for. Together with thetechnobears next post about polyphonic aftertouch this answers my most pressing questions for the moment.</p>

<p>Is it alright if I sooner or later pump you for your experiences with hardware interfacing solutions?</p>

        <p>Hi Technobear.</p>

<p>Ah yes, the penny drops. I already saw a lot of interesting Mutable Instruments derived objects, among them the modeled oscillators I already mentioned. Is this because Mutable Instruments also runs on open source code or is it more a special courtesy of its developers?</p>

<p>So the next step for me should indeed be to get my feet wet and learn the propper dialect before I put in more stupid questions. Here in the Netherlands they do however say: "1 fool can ask more then 10 wise men can answer" so you might in the end still regret giving this advice! <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>I used the Korg Z1 for some time as well but found it's models a bit too restricting. You are simply pushed into a certain environment and it can be difficult to make a blown wood model or whatever sound like anything else. So fantasy instruments are hard to create. That is why I love the Technics WSA1 so much. It might not add specific response artefacts like overblowing because it works with an "impulse / exiter" sample pool but everything is freely interchangeable which makes it very flexible. Since I have gotten around to using it my benchmark when encountering something else has always been: Can it do stuff that my WSA cannot? Most of the time the answer was / is NO, however esoteric or beguiling the other instruments might seem to be. The only thign one can not do is load ones own samples inot it. If I could find a way around that problem I would probably still not switch to anything else. Can there be higher praise for an instrument, especially for one that is almost 30 years old? For more see my Starship One project. By the way: A major update of the INSTRUMENT and WRITING sections is presently underway so press control R regularly.</p>

        <p>It's great that you like my CS80 article. Do also read the one about the Son Of GX project. A second part is about to be added. You'll be surprized how much commonality there actually was within the Yamaha range. Most of us might see organs as a different, inferior species (I certainly used to think so) but Yamaha surely didn't.</p>

        <p>The WSA1 does sound pretty incredible, and I already have downloaded that album you mentioned, I chose to download the original version over the remastered version.  Have listened to two of the tracks so far, was listening to them while browsing this forum!</p>

<p>I will indeed read the other stuff you mention <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/relaxed.png?v=3" title=":relaxed:" class="emoji" alt=":relaxed:"></p>

<p>Regards the KORG Z1, I can't remember exactly what it was that frustrated me about it, but what you said would sound about right I think.  If I recall, they marketed it as a sort of synthesists dream toolbox, and it was really for string type instruments I bought it, I wanted really nice violins etc, but it didn't satisfy, not in the way I specifically wanted it to anyway.  I realised a few things over the years <em>after</em> I sold it, so my frustration with it might even be unfounded for all I know, but yes, I do remember feeling restricted by it in ways I would never expect from such a synthesizer, so it was probably the models themselves.</p>

<p>Was certainly a nice sythesizer though, no doubt about that!</p>

        <p>It was actually quite hard to get a decent violin out of the Z1 anyway. The best I got out of it was some chinese sounding thing, allthough it was quite expressive. Still the WSA is much better at it. I included a lot of cello work in Zamisdat.</p>

        <p>you actually CAN edit the code of the MI modules, though only to a limited extend as it is based upon the header files, which of course, I'm not going to edit.<br>First thing to do is to make a copy of the module by saving it to you home-folder, so don't embed the module, but.go to "edit module" and hit "copy to library" without embedding it.<br>then you can edit the module that you've saved (though still, don't embed it but save it again after a modification.)</p>

<p>note though, that I only did two edits. the first edit I did was adding an "active" control, so I could add multiple MI oscillators to a single project without the need for them to run all the time while their not in use.<br>Second edit is to use an attribute to choose between the different oscillator modes, though not all the oscillators use the same code. eg. most of the drums, except cymbal, use the same code, same for most "physical modeling" oscillators.</p>

<p>Still, I think it should be possible to add modulation entries by looking at the header file and see what internal parameters the code is using, perhaps some of these can be modded by an "external" code.</p>

<p>ps. I haven't saved these modded MI modules to the community folder as I'm not sure whether I'm allowed to share these..</p>

        <p>Some MI code is in headers ... (including some moved by johannes) but much is not e.g. the bulk of clouds and elements is not in header files. </p>

<p>( but your not altering the MI code in this case, so it doesn't matter)</p>

<p>... and this is changing in the next release, headers and source code are all being rearranged. </p>

<p>If you just want to add inlets, and so MI code is unchanged , this is better to add to factory objects ( as I did with lmnts and clds recently.) , just fork the repo edit and send us a PR.</p>

<p>imo, generally as these factory objects are not mature it's better to improve these rather than spur off copies with minor changes which will likely be duplicated in time.</p>

        <p>Errrrrrrrrrrrr? Although I do seem to get the core of your thought it's all too much "local dialect" to me still. I'll order my Axoloti in a few days and get my own show sort of running. But please carry on in the mean time. Any flowers that wil grow from my crazy wishes will surely strengthen the platform AND the community, even if only by making poeple finetune such earlier work. Thanks!</p>

<p>yeah sorry, its tricky here... axoloti is a really "broad church" with everyone with different goals, and different backgrounds (musicians, patchers, developers, hardware engineers, dsp coders), each have different perspectives on topics. so often topics take different twists and turns (we only 'lightly moderate'). <br>I dont understand half the hardware category, but I still follow the topics, and learn a lot <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>Its actually what I like about axoloti, its so many things to so many people... <br>though it can be hard to follow at times, especially at the beginning, and I suspect that can be frustrating for some, if they  just want to know how to do X.</p>

        <p>Yup, that is also what attracts me to it. It promises to be an optimal mix of hardware stability and software versatility that even enables peoeple who are not part of the music instrument industry to implement their own insights and concepts. Just my sort of thing! My first impressions of the community are also very good. So it's Nerdistan alright!

        <p>Er guys. I have also been following the thread about the 8 voice sample player. I do not yet have an Axoloti so it is not possible for me to verify anything and of course that project is still rather early but am I to understand that Axoloti already has trouble running an 8 voice sample player only? To me that would imply that anything close to what I suggested (reminder: granular sample treatment + basic resonator modeling via a flexible delay setup + a closing subtractive stage) might just as well only be monophonic! Does that sound about right?</p>

        <p>Just started playing with polyphony myself, and while it can suck-up the processing power pretty quck, it really does depend on the objects themselves.  Sometimes I'm shocked at how much CPU is used, other times I'm amazed at how little!</p>

<p>The more you play with it, the more you get an idea of how you're going to get around any processing limits.  If you find the board simply can't handle it, there's always the possibility of running one through the other, and I <em>think</em> I read somewhere that the boards will be able to talk to each other digitally in a future update.</p>

<p>Look at it this way, forget about polyphony for a moment and just concentrate on having a single Axoloti board as a single physically-modeled voice.  If you look at it that way, you gain a lot of processing power back because you're not having to concern yourself with the power required for polyphony.  Then, when your patch is final, you could always play around and see how it handles the extra voices, see what you can get away with etc, it's a balancing act to an extent.</p>

<p>But yup, the polyphony you'll get <em>will</em> vary wildly.  I don't think it's possible to estimate it with any reasonable precision, cause there's too many factors to consider.</p>

        <p>This is exactly what I was telling you before... axoloti is a 168mhz arm processor   (see <a href="http://www.axoloti.com/product/axoloti-core/">here</a>) , not a PC with 3 ghz with 8 cores... but its also 60 euros.<br>on the flip size, it runs a real time OS, dedicated to one task only - your patch.</p>

<p>how many voices you get will be totally dependent on how much process you do... and also how well you implement it.<br>if you put the resonator per voice, it will consume considerably more cpu, than if you use one for the whole patch.<br>this is why you need to start small, build things up bit by bit, see how cpu your using, see where you can accept limits, see where you are willing to spend the cpu. </p>

<p>(the thread you mention, my initial look at the patch, it seemed sub-optimal, ive not looked at it since though - I'm sure others are helping improve it, but I personally dont have time to look at all patches/objects created by the community... gut feeling is 8 voices is a reasonable goal, but depends on what fx you do, which probably consumes more cpu) </p>

<p>this is the problem with 'high level thinking'... I can create a patch that will on paper do as you, but if it would meet you expectations.. Ive no idea.</p>

<p>I bought multiple axo boards from the outset, because I felt that with my expectations were high.... so I planned for having multiple voice boards, which would then feed into a dedicate board for 'global fx'</p>

<p>I dont think you should necessarily do the same, I think a more 'sane' route is to get one board, experiment with it, see what you can get from it, try each part of your 'patch' separate, see its cpu usage... then work out how many boards you would need... and then decide if thats what you want.</p>

<p>multiple boards, currently this can be done, using USB/analog outputs into a mixer... this works ok, once you are building your final setup, but its not ideal during development.<br>there is a plan to have digital audio between boards, but its early days... and by definition will create some latency. (though the good news is, with axo being so low latency, this extra, Id hope will not be an issue.<br>(though as always, buy for what it can do now... not what it might be able to do in the future!)</p>

<p>of course, I do accept one thing here...  the cost of this project, will not really come down to hardware costs , even if you buy 5 boards (not saying you need this), its still what , 300 euro, which is 'cheap'</p>

<p>the real cost, is the investment of time...  which, as Ive highlighted before, may be high, depending upon your skill set... and (again repeating myself) , I suspect, in practice, you will find it hard to 'sub contract' work... it may be your interests lie where others do in which case it will work out... but no-one can promise you this, no-one will commit to getting your project to work... they have their own to get on with.</p>

        <p>Hold Your horses, Technobear. Like I said before I am still getting my head around everything. What is already evident to you is still new for me and having pink cloud dreams before reality strikes is also part of the fun anyway. Or is that already too long ago for you? <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>About combining multiple Axoloti's: If one compares the prices for low end polyphonic synhts the norm seems to be about Eu 100 per voice, although one then normally is inlcuding a complete hardware environment. By the way: Axoloti's cost more then Eu 60. Inlcuding VAT and shipping I got a quote of a bit more then Eu 90. Still a mulit-Axoloti would be reasonably priced indeed, considering all it's other advantages.</p>

<p>Putting them in series like Axoman suggets would obviously be a rather economic proposition anyway (for instance 1 Oxoloti for the granular sampler and a 2nd one for the rest) but when looped through via audio this will have a few distinct disadvantages. Increased latency for one but one would also no longer have a purely polyphonic system but a paraphonic one.</p>

<p>Would parallel in and out per voice however be possible via the hardware points?</p>

<p>To run more Axoloti's in parallel might indeed be th best option. A bit like the old Oberheim SEM system, where similar modules where controlled from one keyboard.</p>

<p>The biggest problem would however be the interfacing with the program. In that case it would at least have to be able to send live setups to more then one Axoloti from one single computer. Otherwise huge "wiresalad sessions" would be necessarry to get everyhting lined up.</p>

<p>I assume that you mean that this is not yet possible at this point?</p>

<p>About putting in my own share of work. That should not be a problem at all. Most of my projects run for years. Once I am commited I am a real tanacious B.. <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>Hi Marc, I just want to clarify what I meant.</p>

<p>I was not suggesting to use them in series other than a last resort really.  This is why I recommend looking at each Axoloti as a single voice, as in, look at a single Axoloti as your processing limit <em>per voice</em>, don't look at it as a limitation of total polyphony.</p>

<p>If absolutely necessary, you just have to get extra boards per two, four, or eight voices etc.</p>
