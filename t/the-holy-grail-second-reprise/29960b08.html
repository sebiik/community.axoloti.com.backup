        <p>Yeah, the exampels I described are actually proof of how near an S-series can come to a CS80 (however much sacrilege that remark might be to many people). It's more that I made the CS80 sample pool just in case the real thing becomes unavailable to me. So it woudl be nice if I could then also include these samples into my setup's arsenal.</p>

<p>Come to think of it. The Axoloti could also do that.</p>

<p>By the way: I have even come so close to the CS80 on the Technics WSA that I coudl even fool myslef if I had't programmed the sounds myself. So the amtter becomes ever more arbitrary.</p>

<p>But still: Do not underestimate those CS80 waveforms as such. The CS has very specific, so called "charged pump"oscillators that give it a rather distinct sound. It's not always only the filters that do it, you know. I am sure soem very specific sounds will still be difficult to make on another platform.</p>

<p>Hm, what about an Axoloti CS-emulator. Not the sort of retro-project I'd go for myself but it could be a nice technical challenge for some of the programmer dudes out there. One would for intance need the very Yamaha specific 5-stage envelope generators for the filters.</p>

<p>No who said that this sort of babbling cannot feed back possitive idea's into the Axoloti user-community.</p>

        <p>A tiny parcel arrived today, and inside the box was, IMHO, the most amazing little device you can add your SCSI retro synth gear!</p>

<p>I was discussing with Jaffa about that USB Floppy Emulator, but then I thought to myself, I wonder if there's such a thing as SCSI to SD card adaptor yet?  I did check years back but they were non-existent at the time, but that's no longer the case!  I found this SCSI to SD Card adapter, which basically turns an SD Card into a SCSI Hard Drive with all the benefits that come with SD, including no moving parts, and complete silence!</p>

<p>And because it's designed for internal installation, it means you get to keep the original Floppy Drive in your gear as well, which is good, cause a floppy can hold 8 bars of music at 44.KHz stereo - and it's just nice to be able to pick out a floppy with a label on it.</p>

<p>So anyway, installed it without a problem, worked first time, absolute luxury <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/heart_eyesae52.png?v=5" title=":heart_eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":heart_eyes:"></p>

<p>I purchased it from an Amiga dealer, and if you look at the reviews for the product on their site, you'll notice people commenting who have installed it in all sorts of retro synth and sampler gear.  Akai, Roland, Yamaha etc.  Really is awesome, cannot recommend it highly enough!</p>

<p>Anyway, thought it might also be of interest to Marc and ST since you're into keeping the retro gear alive.</p>

        <p>Dear <a class="mention" href="../../u/servandisco.html">@servandisco</a></p>

<p>Thanks a lot.<img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/kissing_closed_eyesae52.png?v=5" title=":kissing_closed_eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":kissing_closed_eyes:"></p>

<p>I have at last installed the software on my PC, started up the Axoloti and am now getting to grips with the programming interface. I've just been way too buzy with other stuff during the last half year.</p>

<p>Furthermore this is my first serious attempt to use a computer based musical solution since years. Normally I only work with user-dedicated hardware systems. They might be just as digital below the surface but one does not have to concern oneself too much with typical computer issues. It for instance took me hours to hunt down a double Male USB connector cable to only find out that the Axoloti actually communicates via / is fed by the micro USB connector. Stuff like that. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/confoundedae52.png?v=5" title=":confounded:" class="emoji" alt=":confounded:"></p>

<p>But like I already said on YouTube: This should be a good starting point to actually create my first own model.</p>

<p>Hi Guys,</p>

<p>I've at last found time to turn back to the Axoloti again. Mine is actually fully runnig ny now! hurray!</p>

<p>Now I'd like to take this thread back to my initial intentions. I have namely refined my thinking about how to implement the original idea into the Axoloti</p>

<p>Bascially I have, also thanks to all your inputs, come to 3 main conclusions:</p>

<p>1 - As already expected from the start pure resynthesis is a very difficult proposition. Granular sampling however forms a good, practical alternative since Axoloti already offers solutions for that.</p>

<p>2 - A very interesting insight was triggered by <a class="mention" href="../../u/sirsicksik-2.html">@SirSickSik</a> (if I remember correctly). He said that creating resonator responses for the Axoloti environment would be very time consuming. So I wondered which solution could be constructed form more standard components. What is a resonator actually? Normally it exists of an algorithm that imitates then complex echo response of a virbrating body. The specific character is then obtained from recreating the typical overtones / fixed harmonics of such an acoustic environment. Basically we are however always talking about a sort of short delay / reverb trail. So why not use flexible delay / fx processor setup in stead? Then one will actually be able to shape his own "responses" on the spot. One can compare it it to doing Karplus Strong modeling and impuls synthesis approximations on an analog modular synth.</p>

<p>3 - to come to a really managable solution a menu driven hardware interface would be preferable. To get in impression of the possibilities I have actually started up a new discussion see the <strong>hardware interface concept question</strong> thread. <a href="../hardware-interface-concept-question/3884.html">http://community.axoloti.com/t/hardware-interface-concept-question/3884</a></p>

<p>The pictures below reflect my present insights (working title: Grailer One. Geddit?):</p>

<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/80a589a5d617893eccad4b992094fe0f572ee752" href="../../uploads/default/original/2X/8/80a589a5d617893eccad4b992094fe0f572ee752.jpg" class="lightbox" title="Grailer One block diagram.jpg"><img src="../../uploads/default/optimized/2X/8/80a589a5d617893eccad4b992094fe0f572ee752_1_690x488.jpg" width="690" height="488"><div class="meta">

<p>The sketch above shows my initial concept for a general programming tool. It combines a bunch of submenu selection swtiches and 4 general prameter controls and layout for a sort of advanced loopable envelope generator / LFO combination (working title BrassEG). Note that this layout can be connected to the Axoloti's 5 digital and 15 analog inputs. The afformentioned additional discussion focusses on the possibilitiy of implementing such a solution.</p>

<p>If this does not work one can of course come up with a layout that "only" takes care of 20 parameters/ setting throughout the whole setup and still do the rest via the computer screen. Do however please note that my solution focusses on a general hardware controller with 5 switches 7 pots and 8 sliders, which would be a very nice general solution anyway (so also for other Axoloti instruments).</p>

<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/c8d1ed8bd10f21586b5b8c6d4a5d150a81c341af" href="../../uploads/default/original/2X/c/c8d1ed8bd10f21586b5b8c6d4a5d150a81c341af.jpg" class="lightbox" title="Grailer One parameter matix.jpg"><img src="../../uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c8d1ed8bd10f21586b5b8c6d4a5d150a81c341af_1_555x500.jpg" width="555" height="500"><div class="meta">
<span class="filename">Grailer One parameter matix.jpg</span><span class="informations">1885x1696 821 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>
</div></a></div></p>

<p>This is a quick stab at a possible parameter matrix as assigned to the 4 parameter pots per section/page.</p>

<p>I hope this stuff inspires you guys a bit as well.</p>

<p>I know, I know.  Of course it is still not clear if a polyphonic model of such an instrument can be run on a single Axoloti, especially with the additional demand of a menu driven system added to it,  but we'll see. Dreaming (still) costs nothing and a reduced version of the concept must always be possible. For instance a monophonic version without a menu driven user matrix.</p>

<p>Please let me know what you think.</p>

<p>Marc</p>

        <p>Thanks. I think I already saw it in your folder yesterday. I'll have a closer look.</p>

        <p>Man, AXOLOTI rules!</p>

<p>I've at last build my first Axoloti instrument. It is basically a version of the above concept with conventional single waveform "analog" oscillators (sine, saw, PWM, noise).</p>

<p>The parallel use of an effects section as a resonator works very much like I expected, even tough I have until now only tried out the standard reverb effect! It however already is a great synth now while it only (?) uses 35 % of the processing power in it's monophonic form. Does anybody have an idea what sort of polyphony one can then expect?</p>

<p>The next steps will be:<br>1 - to find out how to replace the oscillators with one of the available granulators<br>2 - to find out how to make it work polyphonically.</p>

<p>I know, I know. A piece of cake for all you old experts out there but I could surely still use a few step by step tips because the more basic an operation is the poorer it seems to be documented. So can anybody out there PLEASE point me into the right direction? <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/sobae52.png?v=5" title=":sob:" class="emoji" alt=":sob:"></p>

        <p>Man, Waldorf have done it again:</p>

<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="Phi8zPZcWtw" data-youtube-title="MESSE 2017: Waldorf Quantum - 8 Voice Hybrid Poly Synth" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>

<p>This is basically my idea(l) put in overdrive. Ah well, at least the Axoloti is way cheaper. About 1/30 including shipping! <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/sweatae52.png?v=5" title=":sweat:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat:"></p>

<p>In the mean time the polyphony nut has been cracked (see "Poly Power User Tips" and "Free Yamaha CS80" posts). So it's high time to crack the granular nut. In the mean time I have also been building a custom enclosure. More about that in a separate post soon.</p>
