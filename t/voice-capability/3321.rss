    <description>Can somebody know-tested how much voices is capable to play at same time from Axoloti wit ARM @ 168Mhz?
I know that depend on complexity of modeled sound-source.
Voice capability
If MI Shruthi wit pretty complex monophonic Synth engine + Arp + Gate + Simple sequencer and lot of modulations can provide one voice wit ATMEGA @ 20Mhz.
Following that logic (One complex sound) @ 20Mhz from ATMEGA
Then ARM 168Mhz can play approx 8 voices poly.
If one voice use 20Mhz from CPU.</description>

<p>Did you sequence that or played live and record?</p>

<p>Wow so many things by you to check on YouTube.<br>Really nice setup, i must give time to watch them all before ask questions.<br>Meanwhile, most of all, there will be lot of experimenting-testing-playing to achieve my idea but first i need "green-light" ...<br>Thank you Mark!</p>

<p>Here is an example of an 8 voice sound (no external fx, all Axoloti):<br><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=false&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F318536300&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;maxheight=166"></iframe></p>

<p>Arp, gate and basic sequencing have much a lower impact on CPU than audio rate objects such as oscillators and filters.</p>

              <p>they are completely different chips, to start with isn't the atmega used 8 bit? (vs Axoloti 32bit), <br>so comparing clock speeds is meaningless.<br>(also shruthi is using a different filter board, so that wont load the cpu)</p>

<p>as you say <br></p>

<blockquote><p>I know that depend on complexity of modeled sound-source.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>you could create lots of voices if the voice was simple (e.g. saw with simple filter), but make a complex enough oscillator with complex filter, and fx and you might be down to one!</p>

<p>so impossible to generalise...<br>but to give you an idea...<br>if I'm careful, and not crazy stupid with fx, I can get 16 voices of reasonable oscillator/filters.<br>if I want more complex fx, and perhaps complex filters this sometimes will drop down to 8.</p>

<p>e.g. some of the mutable instruments oscillators/fx will knock your voice count down... </p>

<p>often now, I put the main voices on one Axoloti, and then feed its output into another Axoloti for the FX.</p>

<p>have a look at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/cortijogazquez/videos">my you tube channel</a> and others Axoloti users , and you will get an idea of what is possible.<br>(or should I say, what we want to use our Axoloti for, rather than is possible <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">)</p>

<p>its wise to keep expectations 'reasonable', especially when we are all used to very powerful pc, an Axoloti is a microcontroller, which is many times less powerful that your average desktop computer.<br>with that said, I was surprised how much was possible with Axoloti when I first got mine, particularly for the price... and its standalone nature is awesome.</p>

<p>anyway, as only you know what you have in mind (and your patching/code skills can play a part too), really you can only know what is possible by trying.<br>I also found once I got patching with Axoloti, my idea of what I was going to use it for changed/evolved, I to play to its strengths.</p>

<p>EDIT: btw, when I refer to voices here, its worth pointing out, often these will have multiple oscillators in them - so even my simple 16 voice patch. will have a few oscillators inside, for detuning, or sub oscillators, etc.  ... and of course the number and type of oscillators within one voice, will have a big impact on cpu... (e.g. think about FM, and how many oscillators you might use in one voice for that!)</p>
