    <title>Libraries not syncing</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/libraries-not-syncing/1765</link>
    <description>Hi all. 
Do I need to register as a contributor to get access to all of this new awesome stuff you are all publishing? Maybe I&#39;m missing something obvious, but I don&#39;t see half of this stuff on github either ?
 I tried &quot;Sync libraries&quot; of course, but I get an error message:
&quot;&quot;
Sync Successful : factory (1.0.10,anon)
Sync (pull) FAILED : community (1.0.10,anon)
org.eclipse.jgit.api.errors.NoHeadException: Pull on repository without HEAD currently not supported
org.eclipse.jgit.api.errors.NoHeadException: Pull on repository without HEAD currently not supported
&quot;&quot;
plus a lot more...... 
I realize that the new stuff should be included in the next release, but I just cant wait ;)
Thanks!</description>

<p>sorry, a bit of confusion on my part as i was not aware what platform you were running on.<br>(windows and OS X have the axoloti home inside the documents folder)</p>

<p>yes on linux, its ~/axoloti and yes ~/axoloti/objects, patches were where i assumed users would put personal files. <br>I use ubuntu as well, but I wasn't sure how common ~/Documents is on other distros ... and even with ubuntu, as I tend to use linux for low level and dev stuff - Ive never seen ~/Documents used by anything <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=2" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>so thought ~/axoloti was 'a safer bet'  ....  I guess we could look for a ~/Documents folder, and if it exists place the axoloti folder in there, it would be more consistent with windows and OSX.</p>

<p>anyway, you can put libraries where you like, generally we don't care about their locations... the only thing we refer to is the ID, and then only for factory/community where we have some logic to ensure users dont overwrite things and objects are placed in the right place in the community library.</p>

<p>Ouch no fun <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/frowning.png?v=2" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> <br>one thing you might want to consider is creating your own repo on either bitbucket or github, that way you can sync your own personal patches/objects there for 'backup' purposes, this is what I do.<br>(I prefer bitbucket for 'private' stuff, as its free to host private repos, whereas github (last time i checked) charges for private repos, only public are free)</p>

<p>anyway, have fun... happy patching</p>

<p>thats actually what the one in Documents/axoloti is for,  documents/axoloti/objects , documents/axoloti/patches  (aka home library) is the users 'personal' library, we wont touch this (or any other library that is of type 'local') during sync.<br>hmm, perhaps I should have called it 'personal' or 'user' to make that a bit clearer <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=2" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>note: the reason its there (rather than say documents/axoloti/user/objects,patches) is priory to libraries, we had been suggesting this location for users objects and patches, so made sense to use this to ease migration.</p>

<p>Hahaha! "Nosing about" on the web is actually second on my list of preferred learning styles.  "Trying stuff until it breaks" is first, and "asking questions" is way down the list. <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/confused.png?v=2" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> </p>

<p>The issue in my case was that I had indeed messed around with the libraries so they refused to sync. I had been making copies of some community patches and objects, and working on them inside the same folder. Resetting libraries did the trick. I now keep all my own work in a separate axoloti "objects/patches" folder structure over in "home/Documents", which I have added to the axoloti library locations in the preferences. No mess in my main axoloti file structure, and it works great!<br>By the way, thanks for the great forum guys. Very helpful!</p>

<p>I just wanted it to be clear to new users, visiting github.com, is not a needed/recommended part of the workflow.<br>this is going to be important when we get this out as an 'official' release, and so many more users will start using, and then potentially searching the forum, if they have issues.</p>

<p>Indeed, I just pointed out the branch as they were nosing about on github anyway. <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=2" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>generally, users do not need to go to github.com (or particular branches) to use Axoloti, it can all be done within the Axoloti app.</p>

<p>in fact, Id prefer users without git experience do <strong>not</strong> go there as it will lead to 'confusion', just browse using the filesystem locally -  lets keep it simple.</p>

<p>(the only 'requirement' to go to github.com is to register as a user if you are going to be a contributor, but registering is the only thing needed to be done... some have accidentally forked the repo)</p>

<p>as I said to the OP, the reason for the git error, was due to editing content in the libraries, which essentially except for 'your contributor area' in the community library you should consider 'read-only'.</p>

<p>if you get into a weird state like the recommended path will be to reset the libraries, this is for two reasons<br>- we don't distribute tools needed to fix it in other ways<br>- I dont have the time to explain how to deal with git, which can be a complex beast.</p>

<p>in a future release, i hope to extend the current implementation such that the above issue are avoided, and if encountered is dealt with. but again, automatically, so the user does not have to be concerned with how its implemented. (as you may appreciate, making something simple for the end-user tends to mean the complexity is borne by the developer <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=2" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ) </p>

<p>of course, I recognise we also need a proper patch browser and also access to version history is useful, they are on my 'wish' list too.</p>

<p>the only thing to bear in mind, is don't change anything in the libraries outside 'your area', future version <strong>will</strong> overwrite it (and this is already the case for the factory objects.)</p>

<p>EDIT : moved to helpdesk, the community library section is just for how to use, and contribution post. <br>(it needs to be kept 'minimal' so its easier to navigate)</p>

<p>go to preferences, and do 'reset libraries'</p>

<p>usually the above happen if you alter the community library, which if you are not a contributor you should consider 'read only'</p>

              <p>Hi all. <br>Do I need to register as a contributor to get access to all of this new awesome stuff you are all publishing?
