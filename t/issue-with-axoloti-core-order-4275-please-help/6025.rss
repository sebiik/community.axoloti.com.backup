    <title>Issue with Axoloti Core order #4275, please help</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/issue-with-axoloti-core-order-4275-please-help/6025</link>
    <description>Yesterday I ordered one piece of Axoloti Core. Payed with PayPal.
Checked afterwards to see if the payment was done. Yes, the transfer was made on the address of johannes.taelman@gmail.com. Checked with my bank account and the money were sent.
Then I checked out the axoloti website and it says that my order state is &quot;cancelled&quot; (?!).
I wrote about the problem to the address I made the payment to on PayPal, to johannes.taelman@gmail.com, attaching the image with the page that says that the order is &quot;cancelled&quot;, and the recipe of the payment, but I got no answer.
Please help me with some advice, if anybody knows where else to address this problem.
If Johannes Taelman is reading this, please check the email, my order is #4275, placed on September 23 2019. 
______________________

26 september 2019 EDIT: 

The cancelled order is 4275, though the PayPal receipt states &quot;Invoice ID: WC-4276&quot;.
So if anybody is trying to solve this, might check on both order numbers; might be that 4275 was cancelled by me because one credit card was not accepted by Pay Pal, but still, I payed with another card, and the transaction was sucessful. If this is the case, the (successful) order #4276 doesn&#39;t appear in my account, only #4275, that is cancelled.

______________________

BTW, there are at least two problems with the axoloti website:

1. On the buying page is written that it is possible to order paying directly by card if you don&#39;t have a PayPal account, but actually there is no such option.
2. There is at least very difficult, if not impossible, to login into the axoloti website to see your order status. There is no login button. The only way to login is to make an order, go to the checkout page, and there is an option to login, but after that you have to let the order uncompleted. Still not sure if logging in to the community (this) website, keeps you logged in to the axoloti website, and if it does, how do you get to &quot;my account&quot; page afterwards, to see your order status.

Thank you,
Dragos Andriana.</description>

              <p>I can't imagine Johannes would have cancelled your order, but it's definitely not unusual to have to wait for a reply from King Axo himself due to how busy he is with all this stuff.</p>

<p>Anyway, sorry you're left in the dark for now, but hopefully not for too long.</p>
