    <description>Hi, 
my axoloti core board doesn&#39;t turn on when powered via USB or with power supply 9V 1A center positive. during the last session everything worked correctly, but it doesn&#39;t work now :(

I followed the instructions for the flash recovery but in any case the software does not recognize the board.

someone can help me? The board is compromised forever?

Thanks a lot</description>

              <p>I recall doing a post-mortem analysis remotely on a board with a heating up U4/U5, and it appeared that those heating up was not a cause of failure but a consequence. After eliminating U4/U5 and applying power, it was found that the microcontroller (IC2) itself started to heat up instead. The event that caused the microcontroller to fail was impossible to identify, but the hypothesis was that a flying, exposed power supply wire carrying over 6V temporarily made contact with a GPIO pad. <br>So, yes it is probably dead...</p>

<blockquote><p>I followed the instructions for the flash recovery but in any case the software does not recognize the board.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>just to be clear, on flash recovery...<br>you held down S1 whilst powering on the board, and kept it pressed down... do you see LEDS blinking? or what happens? <br>then once powered up,  start axoloti, go to select device... do you see NO devices listed?  or  some device with DFU in the name.</p>

<p>(make sure you have nothing else connected to board, and the axoloti is connected directly to your computer) </p>

<p>also be good to get some other general info...<br>- any lights coming on?<br>- have you connected anything to the gpio pins?<br>- version of axoloti software/ operating system?<br>- what version is your board? when was it shipped? </p>

<p>as far as i know, the only (rare) board failure that has been seen is for the the v1.0 boards, and is described here <br>(it sounds like this is not sure issue - since in the above issue, users are able to still  see the board, but you say you cannot... but I thought id raise it, as its the only failure I know of)</p>

  <blockquote>
    A few unexpected board failures have been reported, here's the analysis. 

Scope

Affects board revision 1.0, fixed in board revision 1.1

Symptoms:


The red LED keeps blinking forever after startup, while green LED is steady on
Establishing connection is still possible, but extremely low voltages are reported for the 5V supply and the VDD supply, and patches don't run.
IC3 (right behind the output jack) becomes extremely hot


(all three!) 

Failure analysis:

While any short on the audio powe…

<p>is your board a v1.0 , it printed on the board, and would have been from the initial crowdfunding batch or shipped before December 2015.</p>

              <p>Hi, <br>my axoloti core board doesn't turn on when powered via USB or with power supply 9V 1A center positive. during the last session everything worked correctly, but it doesn't work now <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>I followed the instructions for the flash recovery but in any case the software does not recognize the board.</p>

<p>someone can help me? The board is compromised forever?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot</p>
