    <title>How to understand Axoloti &amp; MTM Axocontroller object language</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/how-to-understand-axoloti-mtm-axocontroller-object-language/4307</link>
    <description>I could do with some guidance please. I&#39;ve had the Axoloti and the Tom Whitwell&#39;s MTM Axo Controller for quite some time. The whole Axo GUI object language concept is alien to my brain so I do struggle to get going! It feels like there&#39;s a presupposition that to use the Axo you already &#39;get&#39; this aspect. I need an a-b-c hand holding to get going.

I can load factory demo&#39;s effectively to operate standalone. I also loaded some Axo patches from the community. I&#39;ve not yet effectively loaded any patch that demonstrates the MTM Control in standalone but I have successfully loaded a this patch: https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/musicthingmodular-controller-subpatch/1921/9

What I want to do:

1. Load a patch that I can test standalone that uses the MTM controller. e.g. a synth
2. Learn how to map the controller to the Axoloti to create my own instruments.

Ultimately I want to create a live FX processor &amp; controller for use with piezo&#39;a. At least as an initial start point. 

How do I break through to explore the Axoloti &amp; MTM Controller?</description>

              <p>oh for sure modular hardware patching is different.... <br>my point was, for those that dont even have that, its even harder....  e.g. you need to understand how to patch a VCA/ENV/audio together... which is not intuitive in hardware either, until its explained how CV and audio interact <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> </p>

<p>anyway, back to your  case...</p>

<p>given you have this experience , Id highly recommend you look at the tutorials, in particular how a mono voice is patches, this should look very familiar to you . ... so look at that, then recreate yourself.<br>(this builds on what you already know) </p>

<p>then you just need to slowly extend its, add a small thing to it.</p>

<p>heres an example of how to build up : <br>- take the tutorial 6 (evenlopes) <br>- use it, see what it does, then try to get a bit of an understanding of what it does,<br> - now look to add axo control to it<br>- add my object  tb/ctrl/axoc/bigknobs<br>- disconnect the midi pitch , and replace it by the output 1 from bigknobs<br>(notice pitch is now controlled by knob 1) <br>- add tb/ctrl/axoc/switches<br>- replace the triggers to the envelope with the switch output</p>

<p>viola, you have now converted a patch to use axoc - easy</p>

<p>really, just like learning hardware modulars, patching is about 'doing' , the more you do , the more you learn.<br>its really not hard, its just practice....</p>

<p>and just like modulars, initially start small, connect a few wires, work out what works, what doesn't... you cant break anything ... before you know it , you'll have a huge tangle of cables <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> </p>

<p>also given you know modulars, perhaps focus on similar patches initially, just to get your feet under the table with something your familiar with , then you can branch out from there.</p>

<p>another tip: many objects have help patches, so right click -&gt; help, and they demonstrate how to use the object.<br>(some are better than others <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> )</p>

              <p>Hi</p>

<p>thanks for replying so quickly. I'll check out your patch, thanks for that. looking at it I can't see how I would know how to create a patch to connect a physical control on the MTM to effect a sound. i suppose i'm just pressed up against my own lack of knowledge/understanding.</p>

<p>I have a reasonable stock of hardware modular, in fact with the exception of an electron all my gear is CV. so at least on that front I understand patching. real world patching is somewhat more kinaesthetic and simpler to follow and troubleshoot. perhaps if you are familiar in both realms the parallel runs well but I feel like the hardware analogy breaks down pretty quickly. i'm really a hardware guy that wants to stretch into software patching to create my own hardware boxes. the axoloti should be the gateway and 'interface' between. i understand my position is a case of sitting at the bottom of a learning curve wanting to be much further up!</p>

<p>software patching has always stumped me. i wanted to figure out M4Live but never got anywhere. Puredate looks really interesting. All of this stuff does. Full of promise and potentialI and that's my interest. </p>

<p> think i just need to work on it until i get some incremental improvement in results and understanding.</p>

              <p>depends what you want to do...</p>

<p>if you want to do some fx, try my axoclds patch <br>library-&gt;community-&gt;tb-&gt;axoc-&gt;axoclds</p>

<p>you can then open the patch to see how it works.</p>

<p>however, I suspect when you say this environment is alien to you, its because you have not done any patching before? have you done any hardware modular patching?</p>

<p>there are some patching videos out there for axoloti... did you check these out yet? also looking through the simple tutorial patches is a way to start.</p>

<p>if you have not done any patching, then i think you might need to start understanding the concepts of modules (=objects) and connecting via wires, and building things up in this way.</p>

<p>theres a lot of ways to do this...<br>perhaps try VCV rack on a computer to get familiar with wiring things up... its not the same as axoloti, but it gives some basic concepts.<br>if you want a more 'programmatic' approach, like axoloti you could checkout pure data, which has hundreds of tutorial videos on youtube <br>... you dont need to learn either of these really, just get a 'feel' of whats going on, then you'll quickly see how similar axoloti is.</p>

<p>as for linking up MTM axo control, there are no factory objects for the MTM axocontrol because its not an axoloti product, its third party, but there are a bunch of axoloti control objects in the community library (including my own, see objects/community/tb/axoc ?) which make it pretty easy to hook things up.. but you of course need to know the basics of axoloti patching first.</p>
