        <p>I could do with some guidance please. I've had the Axoloti and the Tom Whitwell's MTM Axo Controller for quite some time. The whole Axo GUI object language concept is alien to my brain so I do struggle to get going! It feels like there's a presupposition that to use the Axo you already 'get' this aspect. I need an a-b-c hand holding to get going.</p>

<p>I can load factory demo's effectively to operate standalone. I also loaded some Axo patches from the community. I've not yet effectively loaded any patch that demonstrates the MTM Control in standalone but I have successfully loaded a this patch: <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/musicthingmodular-controller-subpatch/1921/9">http://community.axoloti.com/t/musicthingmodular-controller-subpatch/1921/9</a></p>

<p>What I want to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Load a patch that I can test standalone that uses the MTM controller. e.g. a synth</li>
<li>Learn how to map the controller to the Axoloti to create my own instruments.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ultimately I want to create a live FX processor &amp; controller for use with piezo'a. At least as an initial start point. </p>

<p>How do I break through to explore the Axoloti &amp; MTM Controller?</p>

        <p>depends what you want to do...</p>

<p>if you want to do some fx, try my axoclds patch <br>library-&gt;community-&gt;tb-&gt;axoc-&gt;axoclds</p>

<p>you can then open the patch to see how it works.</p>

<p>however, I suspect when you say this environment is alien to you, its because you have not done any patching before? have you done any hardware modular patching?</p>

<p>there are some patching videos out there for axoloti... did you check these out yet? also looking through the simple tutorial patches is a way to start.</p>

<p>if you have not done any patching, then i think you might need to start understanding the concepts of modules (=objects) and connecting via wires, and building things up in this way.</p>

<p>theres a lot of ways to do this...<br>perhaps try VCV rack on a computer to get familiar with wiring things up... its not the same as axoloti, but it gives some basic concepts.<br>if you want a more 'programmatic' approach, like axoloti you could checkout pure data, which has hundreds of tutorial videos on youtube <br>... you dont need to learn either of these really, just get a 'feel' of whats going on, then you'll quickly see how similar axoloti is.</p>

<p>as for linking up MTM axo control, there are no factory objects for the MTM axocontrol because its not an axoloti product, its third party, but there are a bunch of axoloti control objects in the community library (including my own, see objects/community/tb/axoc ?) which make it pretty easy to hook things up.. but you of course need to know the basics of axoloti patching first.</p>

        <p>Hi</p>

<p>thanks for replying so quickly. I'll check out your patch, thanks for that. looking at it I can't see how I would know how to create a patch to connect a physical control on the MTM to effect a sound. i suppose i'm just pressed up against my own lack of knowledge/understanding.</p>

<p>I have a reasonable stock of hardware modular, in fact with the exception of an electron all my gear is CV. so at least on that front I understand patching. real world patching is somewhat more kinaesthetic and simpler to follow and troubleshoot. perhaps if you are familiar in both realms the parallel runs well but I feel like the hardware analogy breaks down pretty quickly. i'm really a hardware guy that wants to stretch into software patching to create my own hardware boxes. the axoloti should be the gateway and 'interface' between. i understand my position is a case of sitting at the bottom of a learning curve wanting to be much further up!</p>

<p>software patching has always stumped me. i wanted to figure out M4Live but never got anywhere. Puredate looks really interesting. All of this stuff does. Full of promise and potentialI and that's my interest. </p>

<p> think i just need to work on it until i get some incremental improvement in results and understanding.</p>

        <p>oh for sure modular hardware patching is different.... <br>my point was, for those that dont even have that, its even harder....  e.g. you need to understand how to patch a VCA/ENV/audio together... which is not intuitive in hardware either, until its explained how CV and audio interact <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> </p>

<p>anyway, back to your  case...</p>

<p>given you have this experience , Id highly recommend you look at the tutorials, in particular how a mono voice is patches, this should look very familiar to you . ... so look at that, then recreate yourself.<br>(this builds on what you already know) </p>

<p>then you just need to slowly extend its, add a small thing to it.</p>

<p>heres an example of how to build up : <br>- take the tutorial 6 (evenlopes) <br>- use it, see what it does, then try to get a bit of an understanding of what it does,<br> - now look to add axo control to it<br>- add my object  tb/ctrl/axoc/bigknobs<br>- disconnect the midi pitch , and replace it by the output 1 from bigknobs<br>(notice pitch is now controlled by knob 1) <br>- add tb/ctrl/axoc/switches<br>- replace the triggers to the envelope with the switch output</p>

<p>viola, you have now converted a patch to use axoc - easy</p>

<p>really, just like learning hardware modulars, patching is about 'doing' , the more you do , the more you learn.<br>its really not hard, its just practice....</p>

<p>and just like modulars, initially start small, connect a few wires, work out what works, what doesn't... you cant break anything ... before you know it , you'll have a huge tangle of cables <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> </p>

<p>also given you know modulars, perhaps focus on similar patches initially, just to get your feet under the table with something your familiar with , then you can branch out from there.</p>

<p>another tip: many objects have help patches, so right click -&gt; help, and they demonstrate how to use the object.<br>(some are better than others <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> )</p>
