    <title>Help with controllers, keys, pedal and ... more keys?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/help-with-controllers-keys-pedal-and-more-keys/5052</link>
    <description>Hello.

So I ordered my axolotis for a project which involves some custom controls, as seen in this image:

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3415ced48c092d545ff1be1f9f2c16b21fea74a3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;629&quot; height=&quot;492&quot;&gt;

So we are looking at a 

- 5 left hand keys + 6 right hand keys
- 1 left hand wrist bar
- 3 right hand side keys

There would also be:

- 1 pedal 
- a number of pots


Most keys would control filters, one would be a &#39;silence&#39; key, the wristbar would switch source between noise and osc, the pedal is a pitch pedal, and the other pots control things like pedal range, vibrato, volume, etc.

I am reproducing an old speech synth called VODER, many of you may know about it.


I do have help from some people who are good with axoloti and hardware in general, but I thought to get to know the community I could aswell ask for oppinions myself on how to approach this.

There are two things I would like to know your oppinon about.
- What kind of controllers, hacked controllers, modules, parts... to use (I am not looking to reproduce 100% the same disposition and looks, just their functions, but keys should be separated per hand)
- How to plug them to axoloti


Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you very much!</description>
