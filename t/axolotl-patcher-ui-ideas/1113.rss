    <title>Axolotl Patcher UI Ideas</title>

    <description>Hi,

my name is alx. I&#39;m a synth-nerd from sunny London uk. Mostly now interested in Eurorack modular gear, and came to the Axolotl project through research into programmable Eurorack modules. It looks like Axolotl, paired with paul&#39;s Euxoloti adapter and panel, is going to be one of the most powerful of such modules, hence I was very excited to get my hands on one, and am now looking forward to soldering up my Euxoloti, as soon as the remaining components arrive.

I hope it&#39;s not too cheeky of a newb like me to post this, but I&#39;ve started to put together a [Pinterest board](https://uk.pinterest.com/alexdrinkwater/node-based-development-environments/) collecting screenshots of node-based editing software, across a variety of media-types, with the hope that this may provide inspiration, or talking points in terms of future developments in the Axolotl Patcher application.
