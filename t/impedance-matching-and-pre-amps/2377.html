        <p>Even though it is not designed for guitar input there is enough gain for it. I'd get a radial passive DI. I only have an active one - needs phantom power - so I've plugged my guitar and bass directly to it and it works. </p>

<p>I think in the next hardware revision it would be nice to have two jacks, one high impedance and for line/mic level.</p>

<blockquote><p>to accept guitar signal</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>If will work without preamp or buffer, but if concerned about pickup loading, you can use a EQ or boost stompbox before Axoloti, or maybe a passive DI, or use a fx send/return of an amplifier.</p>

<p>This is much less a concern in my opinion. Driving a high-impedance audio input with a lower-impedance source than expected does not matter.</p>

        <p>You probably you already have a stompbox that will work as a pre-amp. If it's not true bypass then you can use it with the effect switched off. </p>

<p>Just plugging straight in would probably change your tone a bit compared to going into an amp...but if it sounds ok to you then it <em>is</em> ok.</p>

<p>Ax output into guitar amp should be ok ...try it though.</p>

        <p>OK, thanks that's what I needed to know, running it in an effects loop sounds like the best way, though some of the amps I use don't have one, </p>

<p>Pickup loading is the main issue, which I can sort with a buffer before the Axoloti, when I'm not using it in effects loop.</p>

<p>One Strymon delay or reverb costs at least $600 AUD and I figured they must be built around some generic DSP board.</p>

<p>So I thought there might be an open source DSP board that could do it and be much cheaper, and much more flexible.</p>

<p>One google search and I found Axoloti, saved me building one myself , and the years of work developing the software.</p>

<p>The other thing I wanted to use Axoloti for was as a mastering EQ, compressor, exciter and stereo enhancer for live gigs, for that I'll need a preamp with XLR and balanced TRS jacks and some sort of converter from balanced to unbalanced and back again.</p>

<p>Does such a thing exist?</p>

<p>I could build it myself given schematics but my analog electronics design is not that sophisticated yet.</p>

<p>I'm very impressed and pleased that you guys are so helpful and quick to respond, thanks,</p>

<p>IMHO this sort of support and an active helpful community of users is as important as the hardware itself.</p>

<p>Awesome</p>

<blockquote><p>I think in the next hardware revision it would be nice to have two jacks, one high impedance and for line/mic level.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>Integrating a high quality mic pre-amp was once considered, but the requirements get very demanding. Say, a TI PGA2505 as front-end, but requires a bipolar 5V supply, and 400mW per channel, then for condenser mikes need to add a step-up supply for +48V phantom power - that can also demand significant power, ~300mW/channel, then maybe a relay to switch phantom power..... This 'd add significant cost, board space, and demand power, while not everyone would need this. </p>

<p>I have found the integrated programmable gain stage in the selected audio converter a reasonable compromise between flexibility and cost for a wide range of applications. It can't compete with a dedicated mic preamp of ~100 euro/channel but also avoids a similar cost... Its lower input impedance at higher gain is most often a benefit, as signal sources that require high gain also tend to have a low source impedance too.</p>

<p>It seems you do not need the gain associated with a mic preamp there, I'd suggest a passive DI-box.</p>

        <p>I don't think adding a preamp is a good idea. You simply can't do it without changing the price bracket of the axoloti. And then people would still complain because it does not meet their expectations... </p>

<p>What I think would be nice is a 1M impedance parallel input path so you could plug a guitar or bass and don't get surprised by the tone due to impedance mismatch. </p>

<p>I believe the cost of additional electronics required would almost be negligible and would allow you to market it as guitar ready for people looking for a digital DSP stomp box. </p>

<p>Just a thought!</p>

        <p>I'd be more than happy to pay more to have a good preamp onboard.</p>

<p>Phantom power would be nice but it's not necessary a preamp is.</p>

<p>My first experiments with using it for guitar effects have not been encouraging to be honest, it needs a preamp for both input and output stages to be able to use it as part of a live setup, it needs to be able to handle balanced lines in and out at much hotter levels.</p>

        <p>for a mic preamp with phantom power you need very likely a bipolar power supply plus 48 phantom power, so you will need a completely new PSU. There are great diy solution you could pair with an axolotl expat audio for instance have nice preamp cards.</p>

&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Acoustic Guitars really do well with an Eden! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/pca262y2jcci9db/Eden%20Acoustic%20Guitar.wav" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"&gt;https://www.dropbox.com/s/pca262y2jcci9db/Eden%20Acoustic%20Guitar.wav&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rather nice vocal too I think.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/doeg05bq7bnowkm/Eden%20Male%20Vocal.wav" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"&gt;https://www.dropbox.com/s/doeg05bq7bnowkm/Eden%20Male%20Vocal.wav&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;User Feedback:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;"My initial impression so far is that these really are most excellent preamps for when you need some &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; inputs. (and who among us couldn't use a few more inputs!?!) -For the price they're incredible, and they fit comfortably into tiny spaces. -A single-gang pot (readily available) or -alternatively- a multi-position switch and resistors (for stepped-gain applications) is all you need other than an input connector, an output connector and power.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Simple, VERY affordable, but incredibly impressive figures. Listening impressions are "super-clear"."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"&lt;em&gt;So far I am VERY impressed. It has oodles of clean gain - in fact +60dB in total.. I did a couple of quick tests with some ribbon mics and their is no audible hum or hiss even at full gain. The sound is rather neutral and uncoloured in character - I'll try to post a frequency sweep next week but I expect it to be flat. It is a good option for ribbons where clean quiet gain is essential. It will certainly get used in our studio.&lt;/em&gt;" - User Zebra50 on Groupdiy: &lt;a href="http://www.groupdiy.com/index.php?topic=51531"&gt;http://www.groupdiy.com/index.php?topic=51531&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
