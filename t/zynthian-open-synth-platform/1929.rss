    <title>Zynthian : open synth platform</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/zynthian-open-synth-platform/1929</link>
    <description>Interesting project, pointed out by someone on the lines community....
http://zynthian.org

Basically an open source platform based on PI2/3 +HIFiBerry DAC+ LCD and some knobs...
then a collection of software they are integrating....

(It seems to be hackable project, i.e. i don&#39;t think you can buy one, not sure if that is in their plans or not)

Its not a modular like, Axoloti, rather a packing of a PI in a musical format, including synths/samplers etc.
It could be nice to see a modified distribution you could use a PI out of the box for this kind of thing.

so far doesn&#39;t look like any big kernel changes, so not using a real-time kernel, and latency is quite high, boot up times &#39;ok&#39;. 

as I have a PI2 + HIFIBerry knocking around, I might give it a go... I&#39;ve actually also ordered some pots to, so perhaps just need a display and I&#39;ll have 90% of the components :) 

as I said, not really like Axoloti, which is provides a modular, low latency  building your own synth platform.

on reflection, I think its probably more a competitor to C&amp;G Organelle, ok Organelle has a keyboard... but mini keys are cheap... also it uses PD, but that would be pretty simple to add to this.

anyway I thought it was interesting :)</description>

              <p>its configure in github for a dac+ standard or pro, but simple change to alter it to dac+ lite.<br>... not sure, if the rest of the software relies on the hardware volume control, which is not available on the lite.</p>

              <p>Hi!</p>

<p>I haven't search a lot but do you know which model of Hifiberry DAC+ is needed? Light, standard, pro?</p>
