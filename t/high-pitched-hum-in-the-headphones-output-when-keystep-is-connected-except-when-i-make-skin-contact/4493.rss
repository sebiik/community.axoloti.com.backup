    <title>High-pitched hum in the headphones output when KeyStep is connected (except when I make skin contact)</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/high-pitched-hum-in-the-headphones-output-when-keystep-is-connected-except-when-i-make-skin-contact/4493</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m getting a high-pitched hum in just the headphone output when I plug in my KeyStep via USB.

* I am using a choked USB cable from my Axoloti to my computer.
* I am using a non-choked USB cable from my Axoloti to my KeyStep.
* The noise goes away when I unplug my KeyStep.
* The noise gets louder when I swap the cables.
* The noise does not go away when I use a USB phone charger instead of my computer.
* The noise gets quieter when I make skin contact with the metal backplate of my KeyStep.
* The noise goes away when I apply pressure to the metal backplate (skin contact optional).
* The noise goes away when I flip the KeyStep upside-down.
* The noise sometimes goes away when I move my cables around (I can&#39;t find a pattern).

My KeyStep is modified to have an Axoloti (sans-midi/power) embedded inside it. I covered the metal parts up with a couple layers of scotch tape, so there shouldn&#39;t be any shorting or anything. The odd thing is, the noise is only present in the headphones out. I really hope this problem can be fixed, I&#39;m using the line out to power a small phone speaker so the gain has to be as high as possible (not good for ears!).</description>

              <p>If the unit has a switching power supply (no big transformer) then that is a real possibility. Switching supplies are notorious for noise and would be filtered less on a device that doesnâ€™t produce audio to worry about.</p>

              <p>I would use a cable with the RF choke on both places. That is a clue to a badly shielded cable or connection. You hear of this all the time with USB connections to Beat Step Pros and other USB peripherals. Since it is a high frequency, it is not a ground loop (the other USB problem).</p>
