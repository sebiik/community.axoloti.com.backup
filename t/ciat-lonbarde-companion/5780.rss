    <description>Hi all, first post here.

I&#39;ve been building up a park of CL-gear and noticed the need of a stereo compressor, EQ, sound shaper especially for the Plumbutter which has a kind of dry sound. I&#39;ve seen in videos that Hainbach uses stuff like the OTO Boum and / or Bugbrand stereo compressor to solve these things but as these are expensive devices and I own an Axoloti I thought I&#39;d give it a go.
Shared is my first try of designing something like this but as my knowledge in EQ&#39;s and compressors is somewhat limited I&#39;d love to get some input.

The goal is to create a warm compressor with some distortion and EQ to lift those bass drums and tame the high notes. The panning module is to balance the output as all CL gear are hard panned L/R which is cool but can make the head spin at times.

Any input, thoughts, recommendations, lectures are very welcome!
