    <title>On/Off For Master Patch</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/on-off-for-master-patch/4145</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, 
I currently have a patch that utilizes a number of subpatches. Each of these subpatches is connected to a mux/mux 2, with a hardware button to switch between the two modes. I&#39;m trying to figure out the best way to create an additional on/off for the entire patch. 
As of now, I&#39;m working around the issue by connecting everything to a mux/mux 4, then connecting that to a mux/mux 2 in the second inlet and connecting all of that to a gpio/in/digital, so i can use a toggle switch to turn it on and off.  
This definitely works fine and can be my final solution but i feel like there must be a more elegant solution that i&#39;m missing? 

Thanks!,
