    <title>About the User Guide category</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/about-the-user-guide-category/51</link>
    <description>This category contains posts to help users use Axoloti, a dynamic user guide.

This category is moderated, with posts representing different topics/chapters of a user guide.

The intention is that the community will extend this user guide, by introducing new topics that other members of the community will find useful, in addition communities members can edit existing topics either for correction, elaboration or extend. (because they all topics are marked as &#39;wiki posts&#39;)

new topics
any user with level 2 (member) or above  can post in this category.
(if you would like to contribute and are not level 2 yet, please PM me and I can raise your level)

once a new topic is create, a moderator will then checks its correct to be in the user guide (i.e. not accidentally been place here), and then will mark the initial post as a wiki, allowing others too edit.

**important note**
do not edit a topic, if you think it may be currently edited, discourse does not have any &#39;locking&#39; on edit so changes can be lost if user edit in parallel.
in practice I&#39;ve only encountered this a couple of times, but its &#39;possible&#39;..
my recommendation is therefore:
- don&#39;t edit a post if someone else has been editing recently. (say last 30 minutes), as they may still be working on it.
- try to edit in &#39;short sessions&#39; , so you dont overwrite changes are have made, because you have been working on a copy from 30 minutes ago.</description>
