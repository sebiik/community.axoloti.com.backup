    <title>How to make a toggle-and-hold, or basically lock a toggle for a fixed time</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/how-to-make-a-toggle-and-hold-or-basically-lock-a-toggle-for-a-fixed-time/3280</link>
    <description>Still in newbie mode here... trying to figure out how to set up some dynamic switching between different types of audio processing.  

When the audio input meets some condition/test, I have it toggle a particular processing effect on/off.  

One problem I&#39;m trying to solve right now, though, is that I&#39;d like to set some kind of lock period on the toggle, so that after it has been toggled once, it can&#39;t be toggled again for a duration on the scale of seconds.  The point to this is because a signal will often oscillate back and forth between test conditions on shorter timescales than this, but I want the switching to be less sensitive and wait for well-separated triggering events.  

It seems like there is likely some way to set up this logic with existing objects, but I&quot;m a little bit at a loss for exactly how.  Any tips?  

Many thanks...</description>

              <p>Thanks everyone for the suggestions.  I tried a couple of these ideas and none of them quite worked but I did end up figuring out how to adapt it so that it does.  What I ended up doing was routing my trigger signal to a counter and applying a condition that I only toggle the effect when the counter value == 1.  I use a delayed pulse to reset the counter after a few seconds.  </p>

<p>Thanks again for helping me find some of the objects that I ended up needing for this!</p>

              <p>I think the timer/pulselength is the way to go, but on the output, invert the signal, then connect the inverted signal to a logic/and object, so your audio trigger is then connected to the other logic/and input, so only when both the audio trigger and the timer/pulselength are high will you be able initiate and trigger your wanted event. But during the timer/pulselength period, the signal will be inverted and will be low so the and object cannot go high.<br><img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/grin.png?v=3" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>

              <p>My first instinct would be to say check out some sort of trigger delay.  </p>

<p>I think there are timer objects. They likely measure the time between pulses. Haven't used em yet myself.</p>

<p> You could use a triggered envelope and a &gt; &lt; or == type of object. Your condition triggers the envelopeand, disallows changes while the envelope is running, and when the envelope returns to 0 could you reallow the effect to come on.</p>

<p>No sample patches, sorry.  I'm a on train!</p>
