    <title>Pulselength synced to clock?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/pulselength-synced-to-clock/3407</link>
    <description>Hello :) 

Is there anyway to sync a pulselength to a subdivision of a clock? 

For example I would like to have an ADSR envelope triggered by a sequencer and the adsr must be on for a 16th note. I know i can use the timer/pulselength to set how long to turn on the adsr manually. But since I am modualting the clock, it would be really lovely to be able to sync the adsr envelopes to the clock. So it is never longer than the clock subdivision.

Does that makes sense? :) 

Thanks, Jaffa</description>

<p>I dont think this is a good suggestion. There is all ready a clock running that has the tempo information and therefore I see no point to add an extra lfo.</p>

<p>There are several tempo synced delays in the com.lib. all ready. Look in DrJusitce folders.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the inpit <a class="mention" href="/users/rekhyt">@Rekhyt</a></p>

<p>But my whole point was that I want to avoid anything that I have to set manually. I am looking for something where I can change to any BPM I want at anytime, without having to type in a bunch of numbers manually. That would kill any performance. But I think sirsicksik's object works pretty well. Best solution I found so far.</p>

              <p>Thanks guys, will try those things out.</p>

<p>How ever while exploring last night I also stumbled upon sir sick sik's object sss/timer/SyncPulse</p>

<p>it measures time between triggers AND THEN, according to the time measured you can set the pulselength using a dial. If you set the dial to 64(100%), the pulse will be hold all the way until next trigger, no matter how long there is between. Set to 32 (50%) it will hold half the way until next trigger. This is really great, no worries of overlapping notes, it should always adjust its lemgth according to the clock..... and not too much manual settings i hope. Still testing. </p>

<p>Anyway always good with options. WIll try what works best. Thanks again</p>

<p>Theoretically you could feed the clock into like sss/Clock2timing, then feed this somehow to the modulation inlets of the envelope but I don't about the scaling and everything.</p>
