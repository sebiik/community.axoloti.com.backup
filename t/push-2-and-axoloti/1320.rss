    <title>Push 2 And Axoloti</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/push-2-and-axoloti/1320</link>
    <description>Anyone worked on making Ableton Push 2 work with Axoloti? I understand Ableton have released a load of Push 2-related source code on GitHub recently.

I ask because I&#39;ve just ordered one, which should be delivered today. Exciting!

              <p>I see, thanks for the detailed reply, thetechnobear.<br>I just bought a Raspberry Pi 2, so I could potentially use that instead. I'll probably just stick to using the Push with Live though.</p>

  <blockquote>This is the start of a project Im working on, to allow an Ableton Push to fully control Axoloti patches. 



I love both Axoloti and the Push, both are really powerful and flexible, and using the Push to control Axoloti I think opens up some interesting possibilities. 

e.g. imagine using the Push to drive a probability sequencer, its got plenty of buttons/pads and encoders, and great feedback via the LCD.. There are not many dedicated hardware sequencers that can offer the possibilities Axolotiâ€¦

</p>

<p>Id already hacked the Push 2 before this was released  (actually its just documentation, no code, as far as I'm aware)</p>

<p>anyway, upshot is, Push 2 will not work with Axoloti directly since it is high speed usb 2.0, which axolotl's hardware is not capable of. also its doubtful if the axoloti really would have had the bandwidth to also constantly drive the push 2 display.</p>

<p>this is not a real issue for me, Im going to be using a BeagleBone Black as a 'front man' to my axolotis, which I need anyway for other controllers. (as I have other usb 2.0 high speed controllers, and frankly the axoloti is not powerful enough to drive) .<br>so my current plan is to have all the connected axolotis stream data back to the BBB and then the BBB will format it, and drive the Push2.  so basically similar mechanism as the Axoloti UI has.</p>

<p>this approach has some advantages, in that it allows multiple axolotis to be controlled from one controller.<br>actually I think overall it will be the best solution anyway.</p>

<p>the BBB is credit card sized, so not exactly  a big increase in setup size <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
