        <p>Hello together,</p>

<p>First post here, but reading since I got my Axo in February -- I really like your community <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>I just setup a Windows 7 64 System on my Laptop, since some driver issues with other hardware didn't really work out under Linux (I'd prefer that, but well..). </p>

<p>So I happily saw release 1.0.12-2, downloaded and installed as usual;  <code>no matching PID/VID</code>. Bummer.</p>

<p>I read thoroughly existing threads with similar topics, but the suggested methods do not work. I can further rule out a faulty cable or faulty Axo, since both work on the linux partition of the very same machine without a hitch. </p>

<p>The actual problem:</p>

<p>Windows will recognize both Axo-Devices, but the axo-patcher still won't find the unit.</p>

<p>I tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>replacing the driver for Axo Bulk IF with Zadig (Zadigversion from Axo_Runtime and newer version from Website)<br>=&gt; no change. Substituting libusb-drivers works "for windows", since it will show in the device manager under "libusb**-devices", but still PID/VID-error in axo-patcher.</li>
<li>Installing the compatible drivers mentioned before (winusbcompat) for the Bulk IF<br>=&gt; no change. Recognized by windows as "WinUsb 1.0", but PID/VID-error in axo-patcher.</li>
<li>Booting to Flashrescue.<br>That one is interesting since it works as described <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/installing-on-windows/36">here</a> up to the point where the axo-patcher will not detect any DFU-device. (Windows recognizes the ST*-device and lets me change drivers accordingly.)</li>
<li>Booting with s2 held down to remove any sdcard-weirdness (I understood that this could help, but can't find the thread right now).</li>
</ul>

<p>I tried all of the above also with release 1.0.12 to no avail. </p>

<p>The laptop is a Lenovo Thinkpad (e535), the chipset from AMD; I removed the Lenovodrivers and let Windows-Update get its generic driver for the USB-Host, still nothing. </p>

<p>To me this reeks of a weird cornercase of driverfu**ckups under win, but I am out of my wits. Any of you guys got some idea? </p>

<p>Thanks &amp; Keep up the good work, <br>-alt</p>

        <p>As <a class="mention" href="/u/azaxo">@azaxo</a> said, remove the driver. If that does not help, uninstall it. If that still does not help, scour the system for USB-serial drivers and bulk interfaces and remove all of them (or better yet, move them to quarantine). Just about every piece of flash-upgradeable hardware does install similar drivers, where some may be incompatible, and a few rogue ones claim every vaguely related device.</p>

    Hoi.  I recieved my axoloti yesterday. The software reports a problem with the driver and can not connect, 

DId the installation as told in the guide. Axoloti core is visible in Win 7 Device Manager,  The software found no matching PID/VID., when i try to connect.  (USB is connected off course and the lights on the board blink at start up) 

When i choose select device, it sees the axo core and the usb port, at CPU ID it reads: not available: driver not installed. 

Re-installing the driver did…

<p>particularly the winusbcompat part, <br>as you can see from the above post, the issues is that often down to particular hardware- so unfortunately, when users have issues under windows often the solution is different for each of them - that post, and the common installation post (user guide) contains what we have found useful...</p>

The <strong>ONLY</strong> way I have been able to get Axoloti Core or Axoloti Bulk Interface to appear in Zadig, etc is to do the uninstall / reinstall routine I described above.

        <p>Is that a fresh setup, or is there other software installed? Zadig is a tool used to reclaim generic USB ports from excessively greedy drivers - so you obviously have one of the latter on the computer, and will have to figure out which soft- or hardware it came with.</p>

        <p>unfortunately (!?) I don't have a windows 7 box, so hard to know what to suggest...<br>id say its a driver conflict but which will depend on your machine, what drivers you installed, what you machine required (for built-in devices)…</p>

<p>(this is why for lots it works flawlessly, and for others its a nightmare)</p>

<p>the fact the usb composite driver is failing to install,  would be a red flag, for me, ... perhaps a red herring, or perhaps related.<br>I assume you have installed all the latest service packs for window 7?</p>

<p>other than that is normal windows driver troubleshooting, remove as many drivers as you can, only have one device plugged in, make sure you have all the latest drivers possible... check the event logs for anything that looks like an error/unusual , or even try a fresh windows install.<br>( I know, I hate it too... but with driver conflicts, there are not a lot of options, until you know which 2 are conflicting and why) </p>

<p>honestly, personally, id move to windows 10, perhaps the reinstall will clear the issue because one of the drivers causing issues has been updated.... but of course that's far from a guarantee … and potentially costly if you don't already have a windows 10 license.</p>

        <p>Hi all, </p>

<p>this is my first post here. </p>

<p>Today I got my Axoloti board, but too bad - I am unable to set it up on My Win 7 Pro 64bit system; there seem to be a problem with Axoloti Bulk interface - ist is not recognized (or a driver for it has not been found?).</p>

<p>I read some suggestions about how to solve it, tried to deinstall the Axoloti and re-install it, but always the same issue.</p>

<p>And  - sorry - I'm not going to move to Windows 10 now and I'm not going to reinstall my whole system! <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>Because there are reasons to keep my setup as it is and Axoloti was told to run under Windows 7 fine.</p>

<p>So guys would you please let me know, how to proceed? I'd appreciate it indeed!</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>FP</p>

<p>The problem seems now to be solved, due to rather esotheric (but really effective) suggestion by <strong>ghostly606</strong>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Navigate to C:\Program Files (x86)\axoloti runtime\platform_win and run zadig_2.1.2.exe. Go to Options and select List All Devices then select the Axoloti Bulk Interface and replace the driver listed with the WinUSB option.</p></blockquote>

<p>just, in my case there wasn't any driver listed on the left hand side at all.</p>

<p>I started the patcher now and it indicates, that Axoloti is connected.</p>
