    <description>I want to change patches with a rotary encoder. For that, I use a patchbank and the load/i object. Changing patches works so far, but i need to access the number of patches stored in the patch bank to implement some further instrument change logic. I don&#39;t want to store the number in a controller object but rather read it at runtime. I found the function &quot;LoadPatchIndexed&quot; which is called by the load/i, and the c code in patch.c which parses the index.axb file. Although I know basic c/c++ coding I couldn&#39;t manage to adapt the code to use it in a patcher object. Any hints how to read the index file from within a patcher object would be really useful.</description>

              <p>Thank you very much. The code works fine, although i didn't use the depends section.</p>

              <p>Below is an example of reading the number of patches in the patch bank. In the code.declaration section the function count_lines() is defined. It's a simple function that counts the number of new lines in a file. In the code.init section the function is called. The depends section is needed to use the filing system API.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;depends&gt;
  &lt;depend&gt;fatfs&lt;/depend&gt;
&lt;/depends&gt;

&lt;code.declaration&gt;&lt;![CDATA[

  int count_lines( const char *filename )
  {
    int      n_lines = 0;
    FRESULT  err;
    FIL      FileObject;
    err = f_open( &amp;FileObject, filename,  FA_READ | FA_OPEN_EXISTING  );
    if( err != FR_OK )
      {
        f_close( &amp;FileObject );
      }
    else
      {
        char          byte;
        unsigned int  bytes_read;
        while( !f_eof(&amp;FileObject) )
          {
            err = f_read( &amp;FileObject, (uint8_t *) &amp;byte, sizeof( char ), &amp;bytes_read );
            if( err != FR_OK )
              {
                break;
              }
            if( byte == 0x0A )
              {
                n_lines++;
              }
          }
        f_close( &amp;FileObject );
      }
    return n_lines;
  }

]]&gt;&lt;/code.declaration&gt;

&lt;code.init&gt;&lt;![CDATA[

  int n_patches = count_lines( "/index.axb" );
  LogTextMessage("number of patches = %d", n_patches );

]]&gt;&lt;/code.init&gt;</code></pre>
