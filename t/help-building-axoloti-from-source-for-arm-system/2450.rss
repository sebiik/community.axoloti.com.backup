    <title>Help building axoloti from source for arm system</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/help-building-axoloti-from-source-for-arm-system/2450</link>
    <description>HI, I am trying to build a system sort of inspired by critter and guitari&#39;s Organelle.  I started about 6 months ago and got a Odroid c1+ as it was a good option at the time, Now with the likes of pi 3 and odroid c2 its a bit behind the curve. I got pure data running headless and then let the project sit for a few months. Now i have an axoloti core and would love to be able to build patches from the odroid. 
during building the problem im running into is when compiling firmware 

&quot;/home/fakework/axoloti/platform_linux/../chibios/os/ports/GCC/ARMCMx/crt0.c -o build/obj/crt0.o
/home/fakework/axoloti/platform_linux/../platform_linux/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc: 1: /home/fakework/axoloti/platform_linux/../platform_linux/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc: Syntax error: word unexpected (expecting &quot;)&quot;)
/home/fakework/axoloti/platform_linux/../chibios/os/ports/GCC/ARMCMx/rules.mk:180: recipe for target &#39;build/obj/crt0.o&#39; failed
make: *** [build/obj/crt0.o] Error 2&quot;

Any help or ideas?
Thank you.</description>

              <p>No luck. As reported in other threads its almost un-usable. So my idea now is a stand alone headless device that I can ssh connect into then send patches created on the laptop to axolotl through it.</p>

              <p>So, messing around with it a bit more, now I have the UI running.... maybe not right but its running.  Graphics look blurred, but other then that seems to function. Going to play around with it some and Ill let you know how it runs.</p>

              <p>yup, indeed you would need to build it...</p>

<p>hmm, did you install the required components , using platform_linux/build.sh<br>its really important you use the correct version of the compiler.</p>

<p>I had this running on a PI 2, so it will work <br>BUT...the performance is no where near enough to make the UI useable.<br>see this post:<br><aside class="quote" data-topic="2038" data-slug="is-anyone-using-the-patcher-software-on-a-raspberry-pi-3" data-post="3"><div class="title">

(the linaro distro, is pretty good performance as Ive tried it on other things, PI2 as I don't have a PI3)   so , it took a bit of hacking of the build script for linux, and determining where to source packagesâ€¦</p></blockquote></aside></p>

<p>have you tried running the UI yet? even though the firmware doesnt compile the UI should work....<br>frankly, Id try this first, as I doubt the odriod has enough cpu/gpu power to make the axoloti UI a  pleasant experience ... though id be pleased to hear otherwise <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Sorry if that was a bit too much info. I'm running 32 bit on a  arm-v7l.<br>Following the normal linux install I run into <br>"dpkg: error processing archive axoloti-linux-1.0.11.deb (--install):<br> package architecture (amd64) does not match system (armhf)"</p>

<p>So my understanding from digging through the axoloti community is that to run on Arm I would need to build from source. When doing so is when I get hung up on compiling firmware.</p>

              <p>sorry, im not quite sure I follow...</p>

<p>I think your are saying your issue is just building from source for using with axoloti core.. correct?<br>(i.e. at this stage, odriod, is 'irrelevant' to your issue)</p>

<p>did you have axoloti running on linux without building?<br>e.g. following: <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/installing-on-linux/56">http://community.axoloti.com/t/installing-on-linux/56</a></p>

<p>why did you need to build axoloti? basically the process to build is:</p>

<p>a) clone git repo<br>b) run platform_linux/build.sh</p>

<p>is this what you did?</p>

<p>what distro are you using? and is it 32 or 64 bit?</p>
