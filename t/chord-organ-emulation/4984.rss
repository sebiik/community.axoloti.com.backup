    <title>&quot;Chord Organ&quot; Emulation :-)</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/chord-organ-emulation/4984</link>
    <description>thanks for the inspiration @Tombola 
simply using the chorder object of @Sputnki

I recently built the &quot;Radio Music&quot; module of &quot;Music Thing&quot; and i love it.
I did not even know i could also use it as &quot;Chord Organ&quot; . I guess i will order another one to use both possibilities. For now i am using the Axoloti Core to emulate the &quot;Chord Organ&quot; using a similaer simple chord sequencing method that is used in &quot;Chord Organ&quot;. So the Chord Organ is coming out of the Axoloti. Axoloti is also Midi Clocking the Eurorack Modules and the Volcas together. Also it is arpeggiating the chord notes and sends them to the eurorack oscilators through uTune. Its a setup i might keep for a while since it has lots of possibilities. Thanks to Tom Whitwell and John Cage for the Inspiration.
