    <title>Creating a similar solution to USAMO with Axoloti</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/creating-a-similar-solution-to-usamo-with-axoloti/1085</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;m kinda curious about being able to send an audio signal to the axoloti to convert it to midi clock. This would be similar to what the Expert Sleepers USAMO and the Innerclock Systems Sync-Gen devices which in their case use a vst to send a specialized signal to a hardware box that reads the audio output of the plugin through your audio interface and creates midi clock from it. This way it eliminates any midi jitter that would occur.  Can the axoloti do this? Would it take a new object to facilitate this?  Here&#39;s info on the USAMO and the Sync-Gen for folks who are much smarter than I am.

              <p>I've been doing something similiar with my volca sample: I recorded the sync tick and send the same tick back from a track in ableton to the volca via my rme soundcard (normal line outputs)</p>

<p>It kinda worked and was waaay more stable than midi, but sometimes it was missing a clock tick. </p>

<p>Since I liked the stability I would love to do something like this with the axoloti as well but I am wondering if I would need any input protection when sending an audio signal like this to the axoloti gpio?</p>

              <p>Thanks for the hint to look up the volca sync, I might have found basically what I might have been talking about. I'll look into it and let you know if I find anything interesting.</p>

              <p>In my mind, the metronome output could be used, but it's not to hard to get a good clean pulse and use that through a sampler and route it to your audio outputs via your daw. But I'll check out the volca thread and see if that helps. In the end, it's not too horrific of a deal, since I'd either need to build the clock functionality into each patch or a controller patch, but the USAMO isn't too expensive. If the innerclock systems was the only game in the market then I'd definitely be pushing for something like this. No worries. Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>Another use I had for something like this is a bpm counter though... not super useful for most folks, but could be a good way to use records or cd players in conjunction with the Axoloti.</p>

              <p>I don't think you really need a vst if you can just route an audio signal to the axoloti.. Think of it as like using a rimshot of a 909 to send time to another clock, but maybe the LTC is a good way to go about it. I was just trying to see if the axo can do it since it would save me having to buy one to compensate for the realtime jitter that midi instruments get when dealing with a DAW.</p>

              <p>Axoloti can do this but it takes not only development of new objects, but also the VST.<br>It's a bit of an exotic application to my taste.</p>

<p>Not entirely dissimilar is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_timecode">Linear Time Code</a>, I believe many DAWs can output LTC to an audio channel. Axoloti has an LTC decoder object.</p>
