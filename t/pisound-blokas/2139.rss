    <title>Pisound - Blokas</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/pisound-blokas/2139</link>
    <description>an interesting offering for the PI.
there are a few details available here: http://blokas.io  (beta testers wanted)

seems to basically be an audio interface + midi, connected to the PI via SPI, this is then exposed as an alsa device to linux. though there seems to be some support for &#39;auto starting&#39; a pure data patch of the USB drive.

code is open source

doesn&#39;t seem to offer a real time OS (unlike Axoloti and Bela), so Id assume it could face jitter.
but nice too see more &#39;support&#39; for musicians on the PI, they seem to be &#39;targeting&#39; Pure Data, but presumably if its Alsa, its going to work with anything.</description>
