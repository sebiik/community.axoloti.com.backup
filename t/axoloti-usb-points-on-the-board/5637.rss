    <title>Axoloti USB points on the board</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/axoloti-usb-points-on-the-board/5637</link>
    <description>Hello everyone! I&#39;m a new Axoloti user and I enjoy a lot this board! 

Today I was looking at my Arturia Minilab and found a way to fit an Axoloti perfectly inside it. If you have one, there&#39;s plenty of space so you may try too!

Now, It would be really cool if I could use the old cable of the Arturia to power up the Axoloti and then the Axoloti would recognize the actual keyboard as a MIDI device. I&#39;m trying to figure it out if there are some accessible points on the Axoloti for USB power (instead of the miniusb) and for the USB port (instead of the external one). I tried to dissolder the USB port, but my soldering iron is not powerful enough. 

So: the cable would be connected to the Minilab as usual, but instead of going to the keyboard board it will first pass by the Axoloti which then connects the keyboard.

I have no problem to delve into the Minilab, it&#39;s a simple device, but I have problem into locating accessible USB points on the Axoloti.</description>

              <p>Instead of desoldering the USB port, leave it there, but instead, solder on lead wires to the positive and ground connections on the USB port. Or, hack half a USB cable, plug it into the port, and on the other end disseminate the wires to connect power.<img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/grinning.png?v=5" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:"></p>
