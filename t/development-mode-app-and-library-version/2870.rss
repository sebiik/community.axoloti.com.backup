    <title>Development mode app and library version</title>

    <description>@johannes,
 
It might just be that something is messed up locally for me, but what is the expected library fetching behavior if a developer starts from scratch in master? The app should pull the &quot;latest&quot; version of the libraries, right? But where does this notion come from? It seems like from master I end up getting 1.0.10 libraries rather than 1.0.12. If you could shed some light on how the version number in Version.java is supposed to be calculated in &quot;developer mode,&quot; that would be helpful.

Also, it seems like the latest library development is now happening on version branches rather than on master (like master has drifted out of date). Is that correct?

@DragonSF this is relevant to our PM discussion so keep an eye on this thread.</description>

              <p>Sure, I understand that build.xml generates Version.java dynamically. I guess my question is more about the conventions in use. I suspect what is happening with my copy is that I only have the tags that existed at the time of my original checkout, hence being behind a few versions with library fetch.</p>

<p>Let me see if I understand this correctly (I'd like to just jot this down for posterity):<br>1. ant/build.xml calculates the versions for Version.java by figuring out what the most recent tag is<br>2. the library fetching mechanism fetches libraries that correspond to that version, so in effect the main repo tag name needs to match a library branch name, e.g. if the tag "1.0.12" exists in the main repo and that is the version that is calculated, for library fetch to work, a branch of the same name must exist in the library repositories</p>

<p>Does that sound right?</p>
