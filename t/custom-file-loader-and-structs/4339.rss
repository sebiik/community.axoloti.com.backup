    <title>Custom File Loader and Structs</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/custom-file-loader-and-structs/4339</link>
    <description>This is related to @lokki [question](http://community.axoloti.com/t/two-questions-arrays-and-where-to-put-them-solved/4252) about loading arrays, but coming at it from a slightly different direction, so I thought it worth making a new thread.

I&#39;m working on a custom file-loader object, that I&#39;d like to operate in the same way as the Factory &#39;_table/alloc/16b sdram load_&#39; object- ie you select a file, then the contents of that file is copied to SDRAM, and becomes available to other objects in the patch by setting an attribute to the name of the first object.

However, I don&#39;t want my file-loader just to load simple arrays into SDRAM. I want to define a struct in the loader (let&#39;s called it &#39;_ROMHeader_&#39;), and to be able to access the SDRAM data in other objects by means of a pointer of type ROMHeader.

Is this possible?

<p>Makes sense. But, if I've made checks all along the way that the memory has been allocated, that file has been copied etc., and the format of the file is known, I should be OK, I guess.</p>

<p>Hit that one already, in fact. I found that rearranging the order of variables in the struct solved the problem, but it had me scratching my head for a while.</p>

              <p>Hmm.. I still don't think what you suggest will work for me.</p>

<p>I'm embarrassingly vague on OOP terminology, but I understand you're proposing a singleton pattern, whereby only a single instance of data-loader class is, or can be created.</p>

<p>Doesn't that inherently preclude the use of more than one instance of the class (ie more than one of my Loader objects, loading different files)?</p>

<p>That's exactly what <a class="mention" href="/u/lokki">@lokki</a> wanted, but it's not really what I'm after.</p>

<p>I want something that works (to the user) in exactly the same way as a '<em>table/alloc</em>' module and eg a '<em>table read</em>', ie the user references the data in the 'loader' object by entering the name of the 'loader' in a text attribute of the 'reader' object.</p>

<p>I'd also need the Loader object to be 'poly-safe', by which I understand that if used polyphonically, it will not load the same data into SDRAM multiple times.</p>

<p>In the past, I was able to modify the factory <em>'table/alloc 16bt sdram'</em> object to load my file into an 8-bit array in SDRAM, but this only worked because the size of the file to be loaded was known in advance, and could be set in a const.</p>
