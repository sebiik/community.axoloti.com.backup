    <title>Need help with coding something I have patched with factory objects</title>

    <description>Hello :slight_smile:

Lately I have begun to build some more advanced objects and I am now facing a problem that I don&#39;t know how to solve. I have build what I want to make with factory objects and now I want to try to code it. I have succesfully done this with other things, but this one I can not seem to wrap my head around coding.

I am trying to combine these 2 objects:
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/e/ef372a27145edfedb954dd8dc7e3f015cefb4b06.png&quot; width=&quot;234&quot; height=&quot;133&quot;&gt;

I think it comes down to the sum of the 2 inputs of the math/&gt; object is converted into boolean signal, just by making the outlet bolean... But I cant do that in code, just change the outlet. Well, I dunno how to do that.

So I am wondering if there is a helpful soul that that could give a hint on how to do that internally in an object with code?

Thanks, Jaffa</description>

              <p>Thanks man. </p>

<p>I was trying to do the routing <strong>within</strong> the object... It works as supposed when patched up like on the picture. BUT when I do the same internally in an object, with code, it does not work. I think because themath=&gt; output is a boolean. And it ONlY outputs boolean because of the outlet itself is a yellow output. There is nothing in the code that converts the fradtional to boolean. SO I was looking for a way of converting the fractional value to a boolean.... To emulate what the output does.</p>
