    <title>Subpatch: modal chorder</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/subpatch-modal-chorder/311</link>
    <description>Hello everyone!
---------------

In the past 3 days i&#39;ve been working on a tool that could be quite useful in creative situations where a daw is not available: a modal chorder: 

&lt;a class=&quot;attachment&quot; href=&quot;/uploads/default/original/1X/9dde1b12279aa6af0d9559aa638d0682a706c31e.axs&quot;&gt;modal8.axs&lt;/a&gt; (43.1 KB)  [LATEST VERSION: removed master detune and dedicated outputs, cpu usage is now only 4% and i trimmed away 57 KB of sram usage, tutorials are still valid]
&lt;a class=&quot;attachment&quot; href=&quot;/uploads/default/original/1X/e85c842096daa90f5735e16011521a8b92aecdf9.axs&quot;&gt;modal.axs&lt;/a&gt; (99.9 KB) [OLD VERSION, far heavier (10% cpu usage), download this for the example patches]

**What does it do?** 
This chorder allows you to memorize up to 8 musical modes (if you don&#39;t know what modes are you can check [the article on wikipedia][1] ) and output pitch CVs accordingly, tuned to the pitch you want.
You can for example memorize 4 chords and build a chord progression, or you can make an arpeggiator out of it (you could do such a thing using the modal chorder in combination with my 16 step sequencer for example)

**What does it look like**
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/1X/12a3843cb2ee6c8f5818399367b8833ede3f3dc9.png&quot; width=&quot;266&quot; height=&quot;326&quot;&gt; 

Despite its scary look, the principle behind it is quite simple: 
Say, for example, you want to output a D minor scale (which is D E F G A Bb C).
First of all you&#39;ll need to provide the root pitch CV. This depends mostly on the pitch you tune your oscillators in, i usually tune oscillators in C4 (-4), so if i want to provide a D root i&#39;ll have to input +2 in the chorder.
At this point you&#39;ll need to choose the scale. The natural minor scale is the 6th mode of the natural major scale, so you&#39;ll have to click the first button in &quot;Scale 1&quot; and the sixth button in &quot;Mode 1&quot;
Click on the buttons 1,2,..,7 from the &quot;active note&quot; strip and you&#39;re done.
Gate outlets 1,..,7 will output boolean 1, and CV outlets 1,..,7 will output the desired pitches. 
&lt;a class=&quot;attachment&quot; href=&quot;/uploads/default/original/1X/c32c7627db8fc4cf05151db6a2faaba75ab6c91d.axp&quot;&gt;ModalE1.axp&lt;/a&gt; (11.6 KB) 


A more musical example can be found here: &lt;a class=&quot;attachment&quot; href=&quot;/uploads/default/original/1X/e5fbbee7a092348fa598a00340657bf083b18573.axp&quot;&gt;ModalE2.axp&lt;/a&gt; (14.3 KB) 

**Inlets:**
**Root pitch:** Used to provide the pitch to build the scale on
**Select:** Allows you to choose one of the 8 memorized chords

**Outlets:** 
**Bass CV** Outputs the root pitch octaved down by 1 octave. Always active.
**CV (1-7):** These will output the desired pitch values, corresponding to the active notes. 
**Gate (1-7):** If the corresponding CV is active, this will output a boolean 1

**Per chord parameters:** 
**Scale:** Allows you to choose a scale between these 4: natural major, harmonic major, harmonic minor, melodic minor. Check wikipedia if you don&#39;t know what these are!
**Mode:** Allows you to choose which mode you want to use for the selected scale. If you&#39;re in natural major scale, for example, the modes will be: Ionian (natural major), dorian, phrygian, lydian, myxolydian (dominant), aeolian (natural minor), locrian.
For this selector only buttons 1-7 are used (since there are only 7 modes per scale), button 8 outputs mode 1
**Octaver:** Allows you to pitch one octave up the corresponding note, in case you want to play some inversions or extended chords, again only steps 1-7 are used, steps 8-16 won&#39;t do anything (this because there are not 7 steps long selectors in the patcher
**Active note:** Activates the desired note of the selected scale. Because you might just want to play a 7th chord, or a suspended note, and not the full scale. Only steps 1-7 are used, steps 8-16 won&#39;t do anything (this because there are not 7 steps long selectors in the patcher

**Chorder logic:** This chorder will stack the outputs. If you activate steps 1, 3, 5, the corresponding CVs and gates will be outputted at 1, 2 and 3.
So, CV 7 and Gate 7 will be used only and only if all steps are activated.

**No known issues for the newest version, if you encounter one please report!**

**Known issues for the older version:**
It&#39;s really heavy, that object will suck away 10% of the cpu. This because it&#39;s really a complicated patch inside. 
Also this object is quite an hardcore sram eater, this is a major issue since it will easily overflow patches. 
I have some ideas on how to make it lighter, but by now this is it. So, maybe you can use it as a quick substitute for a daw, if you&#39;re in a creative moment and don&#39;t want to use midi or if you need to provide some really big chords.


Hope you enjoy it :smiley:

              <p>Updated, the patch is now far lighter, i also removed master detune and dedicated outputs (they were quite impractical to use) </p>

<p>ALSO, big change: no need to activate bass note. There are now just 7 CV outlets and 7 Gate outlets (referring to the 7 notes in the scale)</p>

<p>Octaver is active only for the latter 7 CVs</p>
