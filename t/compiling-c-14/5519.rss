    <title>Compiling C++14</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/compiling-c-14/5519</link>
    <description>Hey people,

I am trying to run some code from a third party library (qlib from cycfi) inside an object but it looks it requires support for more modern language features namely c++14.

I tried changing the c flag in the Makefile of the patch from -std=c++11 to -std=c++14 which does compile successfully but still gives me an error which seems to be caused by the compiler still being configured to c++11.

The error that I am getting is „body of  Constexpr function not a return statement“, which by what I gather is a restriction that was removed in c++14.

Any ideas on how I could make it work?</description>
