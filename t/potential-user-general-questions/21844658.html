        <p>I picked up a <br>Sandisk 16GB Ultra Micro SDHC  80MB/s UHS-I Class 10 <br>as it was about the cheapest way I could buy something genuine (under £5 delivered)</p>

<p>Looking forward very much - I installed the Editor in anticipation .. I should get the board before the card, so there will be no delay in getting started</p>

<p>I can see the getting started threads - but might there be wonderful tips on best practice and organising things to keep it easy to maintain scattered through many other threads - anything (brief) that comes to mind in terms of keeping it all neat (if this was a discussion on Max/MSP etc i'd have my own take to share about keeping on top of user content and external extensions etc)</p>

<p>I also don't like apps which create additional folders within the Applications folder (it's already too busy)</p>

<p>I guess it will be easy to move this or package it so it's within one 'app' </p>

<p>It also doesn't seem possible to create without the device, have I missed something, I can review existing patches, but wanted to test the patching mechanics and see the suite of modules (i'm 99% sure this is a premature noob comment)</p>

<p>yeah, the reason for the runtime, is its quite large (includes gcc) and doesn't change... so we wanted it separate, and this is the 'easiest' place for users to place it. (ideally it would go in application support) <br>yes, you can move it... and then in File/Preferences change the runtime path to where you have moved it to.</p>

<p>you can run the Axoloti UI, and create and modify patches without the board... so Im not quite sure what your referring to. (as if you can 'review' patches, then you can edit them...)<br>perhaps read the user guide... <br>(to see list of modules , use object browser  by double click canvas, or press N or spacebar) </p>

<p>you cannot <strong>run</strong> the patches without the axoloti board, as the code is specific to the axoloti core board. (this is why the 'live' button is inactive)</p>

<p>(also if you edit the axoloti.prefs file, you will find an 'expert' mode which allows you to compile the patch , but really no point, as you still cannot run it <img src="../../images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile30f4.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> ... this mode/option is really useful when you are writing your own C++ objects, and so just want to test compile... as you may have made C++ syntax mistakes - obviously not going to happen if you are using 'pre-baked objects')</p>
