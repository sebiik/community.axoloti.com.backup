    <title>Patcher Wish - Sort by Type</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/patcher-wish-sort-by-type/1630</link>
    <description>There&#39;s enough great objects being made by the community that I&#39;m starting to get lost bouncing around people&#39;s names - it&#39;s be great if there was a way to define something like a group of &quot;favorites&quot; lists I can use to quickly navigate to frequently-used objects.

I didn&#39;t see a more sensical place to put this, if it should go somewhere else just let me know.</description>
