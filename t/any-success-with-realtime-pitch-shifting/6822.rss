    <title>Any success with realtime pitch shifting?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/any-success-with-realtime-pitch-shifting/6822</link>
    <description>Hi all,
I&#39;ve been scouring the forum for patches that succeed at pitch shifting in real time. Looks like the idea has come up quite a few times without much in the way of a resolution. Has anyone managed it over the last few years? fx/clds, Factotum and PitchshifterHQ produce fairly wild, glitchy and rhythmic outputs for me on even a clean saw wave.

I&#39;m basically hoping to find a method to get +/- an octave on a middle C tuned sound source without massively distorting the source input. Would be a really entertaining way to work with different sound sources. Ideally there would be a method with enough headroom for polyphony. I&#39;m assuming I&#39;ll have to tune each note individually and assign each to a midi note.</description>

              <p>Thx mate, you know I've had this thing for a while now and never noticed the tutorials! Missed that detail in the manual somehow.</p>

<p>pitchshifter2 works well for shifting up but not down weirdly so halfway there. if I get results I'll post em for the archives</p>

              <p>I think the pitch shifting objects that are in Axo library are all delay based, which can be fairly "wild" as you describe it. And obviously also add some delay.</p>

<p>More precise pitch shifting can be done in FFT domain, which is a lot more complicated and cpu hungry.</p>

<p>So I think in Axo world some trade offs is to be expected. There are probably people in here that could make something better, but personally I am not able to.</p>

<p>If you want to play around with delay based pitch shifting yourself, take a look at the tutorial called "22_overlap_add_shifter.axp". It's not directly pitchshifting as it is, but the idea is very close. Experiment a bit and see what you can come up with <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
