    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/mellotron-no-sound-fixed/7653</link>
    <description>Hello, I can’t get any sound out of the Mellotron Axocontrol OLED patch, I have the ten folders on the sd card, any ideas how to make it work?
Oled display patch changing works, tried midi from logic all channels and a midi keyboard, oled oscilloscope is just a line, it never moves, axoloti software shows sd card is connected, tried Uploading separate files and the ten folders, LittleClassic synth works so hardware is fine</description>

              <p>I didn't used the Mellotron patch in a long time, but I remember I had a hard time making work.<br>I don´t remember all the issues, but:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I'm not sure, but I think that the folder labeling don't match the adress in the patch (I remember I had to do something so the patch can find the samples). Or maybe was something to do with the sound selction (sample set selection).</p></li>
<li><p>It only worked on MIDI channel 3. I changed the MIDI channel on the patch but still working on channel 3 (strange).</p></li>
<li><p>The samples don't cover all the keyboard, just a few octaves, so play a wide range of notes until you find the working range.</p></li>
<li><p>I remember that sound selection (sample set selection) works strange, sometimes changing sounds makes the patch stop working.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I don't have the samples anymore, so I can't try, but I can share my modified patch.<a class="attachment" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/3/319963e3793ce07ccb923cd80289e5176dbe4278.axp">Mellotron.axp</a> (28.5 KB)</p>

              <p>I don't have the Axocontrol but check the axoloti monitor to see if the files aren't loading. if you press a key and it says "cannot load file: [mellotron file] you might have to move the files to the main SD card folder. it depends on what folder the table/load object is set to. </p>

<p>if the axocontrol mellotron patch is similar to the mellotron patch in the library (or if it's the same one, this is from memory) then go into the mellotron subpatch, that's where you can check the table/ load object to see.</p>

<p>if you're not getting audio it makes sense why the oled is just a flat line. if you press a key and you don't get an error, hook up a disp/scope to any/all audio outputs to see if sound happens and where it stops.</p>
