    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/relative-encoders-midi/491</link>
    <description>maybe wrong thread to ask but - does axo support endless knobs? Or what&#39;s a better term - Relative Midi input? 
I don&#39;t think any of my gear supports it since i GUESS it isn&#39;t class compliant or something.</description>

              <p>(moved to new topic)<br>Yes, you can already use relative encoders, by doing the decoding yourself with Axoloti objects.<br>the encoding is more a 'convention' than something that needs support as such.</p>

<p>simply use midi/in/cc then decode using maths logic - then you can pipe the result either directly to an object (e.g.filter) or use a mod source object.</p>

<p>I think adding a single object which response +/- (fraction)  might be easy to add, but beyond that gets more complex, and I guess will have to compete with other enhancements (limited time etc).</p>

<p>remember, its unlikely that a particular controllers 'special features' will be implemented, unless there is a user out there that has the controller and feels like implementing it. the code is open source, so that is very possible and is how most open source projects get such things done. (its the only practical way)</p>

<p>and... if your are a programmer and want to give it a go, then you can contribute it, and it can then be merged into the main line. (of course, you can ask questions here, if you need any help doing it)</p>

<p>BTW: when making requests, its a good idea, to post specifics.. in this case, a link to the manual pages for the devices regarding the encoding scheme... with exact specification. I (and probably anyone else ) are far more like to look at it, if the info is close to hand... rather than being expected to find the info for ourselves (remember, we don't have the controller which already makes it a bit tricky)</p>

              <p>The Arturia Minilab and Beatstep have a provisions for several types of relative encoding for their endless encoders.  I bought the Axoloti board to make a hardware interface between these controllers and my Octatrack hardware.  This would eliminate a computer when I perform on the road.</p>

<p>I hope you will consider adding capability to read relative encoding easily.  Is there currently a way to set this up with existing Axoloti objects?</p>

              <p>interesting question... my understanding is...</p>

<p>relative encoding is a way of interpreting midi data... so you cannot 'just support it' you have to say, "I know" this controller sends relative encoding and so I will interpret as such. </p>

<p>sooo... In my Push controller, I know that is using relative encoding so I interpret it as such.<br>(and this could be done with any specific controller support someone wanted to add)</p>

<p>whats interesting is, yes, we could add generic relative encoding support, in two areas:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>low level, i.e. have something similar to midi/in/cc that held a value, and that would inc/dec it using relative encoding</p></li>
<li><p>CC midi mapping... probably more important, here where you midi mapped a parameter, it would have to know to use relative encoding rather than values. this would need additional UI so you know to interpret as relative and is slightly problematic, as we don't distinguish sources (i.e. you might have one controller thats sending relative and another absolute)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>as for usb compliance, yes its not a compliance issue... its not at that level, its at an interpretation level. (you will see in Live, you have to explicitly say you want to use it)</p>
