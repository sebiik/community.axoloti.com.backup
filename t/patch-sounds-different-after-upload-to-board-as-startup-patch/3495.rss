    <title>Patch sounds different after upload to board as startup patch?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/patch-sounds-different-after-upload-to-board-as-startup-patch/3495</link>
    <description>Hi - been a while but back at it. I&#39;ve worked out a patch that sounds quite different when it is running LIVE from the patcher vs when it is uploaded as a startup patch. Is this normal? What should I watch out for when prepping a patch for upload. Seems a bit bizarre, but I&#39;ve went through the patch (polyphonic patch with a single voice subpatch) and adjusted the knob settings on the parent object and saved it..making me assume that the file that would be uploaded has the same exact settings as the one in the patcher (i am using the preset community object but it isn&#39;t loading anything on startup or has any midi commands hooked up to it yet).

*my only idea is that the execution order is causing this since it is different when running a patch with the internal patch loader?</description>

              <p>i think its the execution order of the sample loads into a table..gah. moved some stuff around and got the same sound from the patcher like i do if i make the patch the startup. hopefully this is solvable but is pretty ridiculous.</p>
