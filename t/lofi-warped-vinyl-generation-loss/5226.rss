    <title>LoFi Warped Vinyl + Generation Loss</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/lofi-warped-vinyl-generation-loss/5226</link>
    <description>Been thinking about this one for a few days now and finally just brought my Axo to work and spent some time setting this up.  

Sort of a combination of two effects pedals I really enjoy, ChaseBliss Warped Vinyl and CooperFX Generation Loss.  They both can be pretty pricey so I decided to try to work it out on the Axo and am really digging the results so far (though I&#39;ve only tested it with Spotify running through it, cant try it with guitar until later tonight)

For those unaware: 
[Chase Bliss Warped Vinyl](https://youtu.be/5c4M3rwnzLY)   
[CooperFX Generation Loss](https://youtu.be/SUTxBn41Vew)

Both pedals aimed at simulating vinyl or cassette/vhs tape thats been warped/damaged with age.  Both do a great job getting some of that warm warbly lo-fi sound that I really love

So heres what I came up with!
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7cd34acc8c22067d96c807bea384b0eb72f1c9cc.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;422&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bb884ce7d9def65d1925785ed4d6f48dae657d49.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;302&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/1/175a8f0542dafb3eb585e567f30037e42e601c44.axs&quot;&gt;LoFiVinyl.axs&lt;/a&gt; (16.6 KB)

Really enjoying how this came out.  As you can see, I start with a little sample rate reduction to give a little age and grit, some noise that you can mix in (was way too loud at first which is why I have the couple mixes in front of it so its easier to mix in subtly), a hp/lp filter section that is really nice to tweak and really get that generation loss sound, and then finally I modified one of the chorus stomp objects to just be one signal for vibrato.

It was sounding pretty nice but I wanted to add some random-ness to it all so I doubled up on the sample rate and vibrato and added the sequencer to do the switching so you can set your standard level of the effect and then also dial in the maximum you&#39;d want it to change and while the sequencer is on those bits, it&#39;ll ramp up and then go back to usual after which worked out really well for subtle variations (or not so subtle).  Can also crank the speed of the sequencer which actually produces some almost pops and crackles as it runs which is also really nice


Let me know what you guys think!  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll tweak a bunch more and maybe change things once I can try it on my guitar</description>

              <p>Sorry about slow getting back to you, been busy.  You can find an mp3 sample along with the .raw of the vinyl noise in my folder <strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RpmHXYZJ4UbEOIvHgMzkcaPd51iYGEei" rel="nofollow noopener">HERE</a></strong></p>

<p>Just looped some quick drums (from axo), bass, and organ (from axo) with the lofi patch after - few seconds of the loop playing and then I turn on the patch, doesn't seem like the vinyl noise came out very audible since the whole track is a little static-y to begin with.  Can hear me adjusting the low pass and high pass filters as well as the vibrato speed/depth - I go a bit out of hand with those but the sound is a lot better in person a bit more subtle.  You can hear some blips and almost like time stretching, thats when the VHS Wobble object is turned - needs to be adjusting a bit IMO but easy to do with the knobs on there</p>

<p>Updated patch attached here, you can use an older version already posted if you want to keep using the min/max stuff on random as I originally had it.  Just adjust to taste</p>

              <p>I'll record some samples tonight and post the updated patch.  </p>

<p><strong>Some changes I made:</strong><br><strong>1.</strong>  Removed the min/max vibrato for just a single vibrato - easy to add back in if you like it but I prefer the single vibrato with it being much simpler to control<br><strong>2.</strong>  Added a VHS wobble object that was used in one of the patches in the thread reubenfinger posted.  Have an option to turn this on/off and it comes out pretty cool and blends with the vibrato well<br><strong>3.</strong>  Removed the uniform distortion noise and instead have been using a wav play of just some vinyl noise I found on youtube.  Not a huge difference but gets a more effective lofi sound IMO that I wasn't getting from the uniform noise</p>

<p>Pretty happy with the results now.  I think it sounds best when youre running a whole track through it rather than just one instrument.  </p>

<p>Im currently using the stereo jacks on the axo to run my pedalboard through as an effects loop (in axo left -&gt; out axo left -&gt; pedalboard -&gt; in axo right -&gt; lofi patch -&gt; out axo right) that way I can do guitar/bass/drums/keys/whatever into my loop pedal and then use this patch on the entire loop.  Can get pretty wild with the higher settings on the vibrato control</p>

              <p>So after playing with the one from that thread, I found the one object I liked that seems to be based around a delay and pitch shift that simulates almost like the tape gets stuck then quickly speeds up to get back in time...really cool effect, not sure how it'll translate to actually playing guitar and stuff but I added it to the object with an on/off switch so I can test it</p>

              <p>Oh wow did not even see that thread when I was searching for something similar, thanks!</p>

<p>Looks like there is only once patch in there someone did but I'm really digging it, very different approach it seems like and gets that like effect like the VHS player is having tracking issues or someones manually messing with it.  Think I may take one of the wobble objects they put together and add it somewhere into the patch I made, I thnk the combo could be really awesome!</p>
