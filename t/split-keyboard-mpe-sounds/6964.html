        <p>So I've been tinkering around for a few weeks trying to figure this out. I'm looking to do a mpe keyboard split to control two different mpe sounds. So I want one sound to only respond to channels 1-8, while the other sound would only respond to channels 9-16. As of now it seems that the architecture of sub patches when in mpe mode defaults to listen on all 16 channels and there currently isn't anything I can see where you can choose channel ranges for each sub patch.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a way in which to choose a range of midi channels for mpe play, or how this functionality could be added in somehow? I was thinking the actual code of the patch/patcher object would need to be altered, but wasn't sure. I feel as if I've hit a wall with my current knowledge. </p>

<p>(Posted this in another thread but it was the wrong category, seeing if there's any other interest in adding this feature)</p>

        <p>Following because I'm interested, although sadly I don't have an answer.</p>

<p>This is a problem with many hardware MPE synths, they always seem to expect to be the only MPE synth in play. Both my Audiothings Micromonsta and Futuresonus Parva want to use all channels. I have to use a MIDI Solutions MIDI Router to filter/remap MIDI channels so I can use them together with a split on my Linnstrument.</p>

        <p>Yeah it looks like it's a new type of functionality that has not really been adopted much yet. In terms of the patcher I found this section in the patch/patcher code when set to be a patch/object which seems to define a low and high channel.</p>

<p><img src="../../uploads/default/original/2X/f/f99cc201ef6299d5a9ade4bb30f6605629717096.png" width="471" height="52"></p>

<p>So I'm thinking if there was a selector where the low and high channels could be changed by the user for each patch/patcher object then this might be able to solve the problem, but there may be other parts of the code that would need to be changed as well. Also, I'm not even sure how to change and save modified code of the patch/patcher object, it doesn't seem as straightforward as doing it for other objects.</p>
