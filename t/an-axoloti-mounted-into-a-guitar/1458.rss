    <description>Has anyone tried or thought of mounting an Axo into a guitar ?
I think it would be pretty cool to do, would have to really think outside the square on how it would be controlled so effects could be changed mid song with your hands while playing without affecting the song itself.</description>

              <p>I thought of that, but then you may as well just mount it into the footswitch unit, and save the hassle of hacking a guitar. I know there is the Livid guitar wing setup, but it doesn't look intuitive when in play. One idea is a kind of guitar tremolo with controllers on it, and it will still let you hit the strings while holding it. It would only need 3 or 4 buttons on it to switch effects on and off. And when you don't need it, you can drop it, and it swings out of the way. Then maybe a few other buttons to switch between patches, or even a couple of rotary encoders to switch between parameters and adjust values etc.. mmmmm ... making me interested...!</p>
