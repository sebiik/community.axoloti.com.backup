    <title>Sending program change from axoloti &amp; pulse sequencer question</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/sending-program-change-from-axoloti-pulse-sequencer-question/480</link>
    <description>Hey :smile: 

I am working on a Blofeld sequencer/controller and I have encountered a few issues. 

1. I would really like to be able to send program change from Axoloti to Blofeld. I see there is a prg change in object. I guess that is for changing program om Axoloti, right? Any ideas how to send program from Axoloti to Blofeld?

2. Notelength. I am using pulse sequencer objects to trigger blofeld, but the trigger signals are very short and I can only hear the sound when I turn up the amp release. Is there a way to make the pulse signals send by the sequencers last longer?</description>

<p>2.<br>I have tried using the "sel/sel b 16", but the problem is if you want to send trigger from all steps in the sequencer there is no sound, only from first step and the next 15 is silent. Also if you put two notes after each other, there wil be silence on second one. So basicly only 1/8 notes is possible, not 16th.</p>

<p>But the pulse sequencer send out ALL notes and that is why I use the pulse seq instead. I think I remember Tim Vets talking about this in a thread in here.</p>

              <p>1: "midi/in/pgm" is for receiving midi program changes. It just receives it, what a patch does with it is up to the patch. "midi/out/pgm" is missing, will add that in the next release.</p>

<p>2: "timer/pulselength", or use "sel/sel b 16" rather than "sel b 16 pulse"</p>

<p>update: midi/out/pgm is in git now for inclusion into the next release.</p>
