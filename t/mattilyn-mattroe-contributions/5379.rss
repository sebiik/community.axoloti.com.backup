    <description>Hi!

I don&#39;t know github and my axoloti laptop is offline so I&#39;ll post stuff here beforei figure that out.

Launch control XL objects

Here&#39;s some objects I put together for the launch control XL by messing with the factory midi objects and rbrts launchpad objects. All of them work with the first default bank CC&#39;s and notes on channel 9, so pretty plug and play. 

First up, a sequencer help patch. Bottom right button on the launch control xl is play, bottom 16 buttons are step toggles, top two rows of knobs control the pitch of the corresponding step -

Here&#39;s the light objects, for displaying values from a table on the knobs or bottom buttons, based on rbrts matrix display launchpad object

&lt;a class=&quot;attachment&quot; href=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/8/88cb404d42d4575645e5678d43d5faef7cd88300.axo&quot;&gt;matrix display LCXL.axo&lt;/a&gt; (7.1 KB)

These are for displaying the current step on the knobs or bottom buttons, the light that runs across the buttons as a sequence is playing.

&lt;a class=&quot;attachment&quot; href=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/5/53e3e53b82102cfd76a375329697909ea1d539ee.axo&quot;&gt;step display LCXL.axo&lt;/a&gt; (4.4 KB)

This is a step toggle for the bottom 16 buttons

Here is a keyboard input for the bottom 16 buttons - outputs midi notes 64-80, or 0-15 in axoloti, if you see what I mean.

And some gate objects for the buttons

&lt;a class=&quot;attachment&quot; href=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/1/16348c7ab0e5318dba43dd432e0bde0a838dc537.axo&quot;&gt;bottom buttons LCXL.axo&lt;/a&gt; (3.4 KB)

Hope they&#39;re useful.

    Hi all! 

I posted an earlier version of this in my contrib thread, posting it here to stop that thread getting bogged down in looper talk before it's ready for the library. 

Anyway, it's my new midi Looper setup. I'm still working on it but I've been on a bug hunt and I think it's pretty much done. 

It's 6 new objects - clock receiver, note recorder, pitch bend recorder, cc recorder, poly touch recorder and channel touch recorder. I've tested it fairly thoroughly and it seems to hold up. If a…

              <p>Oh and the shortened note, I think I can stop that from happening, by quantizing the note to the one if its slightly early. The Looper actually starts recording a 16th before the 1, so it catches a slightly early note. Which is fine when quantizing but I hadn't factored in unquantized recording, where it wouldn't get nudged into position.</p>

              <p>I hadn't thought about interpolating, will have a think! Though I quite like just having the higher resolution because why not? Though I may think differently about that than some because I'm not trying to squeeze in an internal synth to the patch, I have an axo dedicated to just looping. So table size/processing isn't as much of an issue.</p>

<p>The table size is big because of the way the automation recording works. Note recording table size is pretty small. And the table size will reduce a lot if you set the objects to use less slots, and a shorter max bar length.  I've got a couple of ideas for reducing the table size for the automation stuff, and I might split out the automation types and have separate objects for cc, bend and touch. That way you can take out what you don't need (I imagine a lot of the time just notes and bend would be enough)</p>

<p>The bit magic is a bit beyond me, I only know what I know about coding from playing around with other people's objects! Something to look into though.</p>

<p>No videos of the current set up yet, but soon!</p>

<p>I have been mainly testing the unquantised option. Yes it could be that the cut off note was supposed to be on the one but ended to be on the very end of the bar. </p>

<p>I think a more common choice here is 96ppq and the option to quantize to 1/3, 1/6 etc. so you can do triplet grooves.</p>

              <p>MIDI LOOPER PRO!</p>

<p>So, I haven't quite finished it yet, but it's pretty stable. Needs some tidying/optimizing and stuff. I haven't uploaded to the library yet, but here's an embedded patch-</p>

<p><a class="attachment" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d89381e8f82c9152cbe3bc3a15d7301b5bf358e1.axp">midi looper PRO upload.axp</a> (104.9 KB)</p>

<p>If you find any bugs/have suggestions, let me know!</p>

<p>It doesn't use a poly subpatch, which means the object is quite 'big' inside. I'm going to make some stripped back versions with less voices.</p>

<p>It's currently set up to record 9 voices at once and play back 15.</p>

<p>The patch is set to record up to 7 slots, and each slot can be 8 bars. You can vary this on the object settings.</p>

<p>Control is set up like Ableton's clip slots- </p>

<p>trigger an empty slot to start recording, trigger again to play back. If recording and it reaches the maximum bar length, it starts playing. <br>Trigger a full slot to play it, if playing it will restart.</p>

<p>Most controls are quantized to the bar (trigger, and it starts recording at the next bar).</p>

<p>It uses a few objects, one for sync to midi clock, one to record/play back notes, one to record/play pitch bend, cc and mono touch. Another that record/plays poly touch. Did them as separate objects so you can get rid of what you don't need.</p>

<p>It records at 128ppq, and can quantize to 1/4, 1/8, 1/16 and 1/32. Note lengths are preserved while quantizing.</p>

<p>It works fine with internal synths, as far as I've found!</p>

<p>Any suggestions, etc, let me know</p>

<p>Allright thanks for pointing that out! <br>For now I only want to controll like 2 parameters in real time, but my voice live gets it's midi via a dsi tetra that is also receiving midi notes. So i have to see how that works.</p>

<p>The Ideal solution for me would be usb support and then having one midi stream for each device. </p>

<p>sending lots of SysEx via DIN is bad idea in any case, because MIDI DIN ports still work at 31250 baud, and SysEx messages are byte hogs. </p>

<p>so, to avoid many kinds of problems, some king of thinning has to be applied before actually sending them. </p>

<p>here's a quote <a href="https://www.gearslutz.com/board/showpost.php?p=13971568&amp;postcount=62" rel="nofollow noopener">from Gearslutz</a> that explains it very well: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another more thorough answer to this in case it's not already fully covered. (I wrote this out mostly for my own understanding of why this is necessary, so please do correct me on any of this that I got wrong.)</p>
<ol>
<li>MIDI runs at 31250 baud. That's 31250 bits every second</li>
<li>To transmit each byte, actually takes 10 bits: 1 start bit, 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit. So that's 3125 bytes transmitted every second</li>
<li>A "note on" message takes 3 bytes (noteon+channel, key, velocity), so that's 1042 note ons messages per second. Alternatively every note on message takes around 1 millisecond.</li>
<li>A chord on a poly device might have up to for instance 16 note ons. A drum machine might have e.g. 8 voices. Add a few monos for good luck and you're in the realm of events that happen at the "same time" from a conceptual perspective are now around 30 milliseconds different in time.</li>
<li>Also consider that we require a 3 byte "note off" message, regular clock messages, 3 byte CC messages, multi byte Sysex messages etc. all to take up the same time slices that we want to send note on info within.</li>
<li>Now consider a bass note that might be as low as 30 Hz for sake of argument (i.e a period of 30 milliseconds). Imagine that you are trying to place two competing notes in a similar frequency band (perhaps these are actually a bass note and a kick drum). Place two 30Hz sine waves 15 ms apart and they cancel out. Place them 30 milliseconds apart and they play double as loud. You can see how being constrained about where note placement happens based on other messages on the same physical channel hurts things musically and sonically.</li>
<li>The easiest way to get around the situation where playing notes for things that conflict like this at more exacting times is to add more physical channels.</li>
<li>Note: This is one example, another similar example is to just consider the emotive feel to drums / piano. We notice small 10s of milliseconds changes in these values.</li>
<li>Also consider the values that you might enter using percentage based swing. A 51% swing value at 120BPM shifts the delayed note just 10milliseconds (50% swing: notes at 0ms and 500ms, 51% swing: notes at 0ms and 510ms).</li>
</ol>
<p>So how many physical channels is enough? The answer to this likely depends on how deep your GAS budget is and how much you face the above problems.</p>

    Hello, 

so this is my first post here and also my first time trying to programm an object in axoloti. I am trying to programm the axoloti as a controller for my Roland Alpha Juno 1 by sending a sysex message via MIDI. I use this two lines of code from the forum to send the message: 

uint8_t sysexArray[10] = {0xF0, 0x41, 0x36, 0x00, 0x23, 0x20, 0x01, 0x10, 0x00, 0xF7};
sdWrite(&amp;SDMIDI, sysexArray, 10);

This works just fine, but I want to be able to edit the parameters in real time using an enc…

<p>My strings are slightly more complicated because the Vlt uses 28bit values that are packed into four bytes and can be positive and negative.</p>

<p>I'm quite happy about this atm because my usb host ports are blocked by midi controllers anyway. But in the future I plan on changing my setup and using a midi interface to controll more of my hardware.</p>

              <p>Thanks for that Smyth, will investigate, what are you trying to send sysex to?</p>

<p>I am sending it down the host port thru a Novation Remote SL and then on to din, sometimes the remote sl can be finnicky about start up sequence, so it has to be on &amp; connected to a power source before connecting to the host port or it won't work, just a thought, also the sysex string is in decimal so you will have to convert your hex string,</p>

<p>eg alpha juno filter cutoff of (midi channel 4) is;</p>

<p>F0 41 36 03 23 20 01 10 i F7 (where i is the data being changed)</p>

<p>and in the object the sysex string appears as 240,65,54,3,35,32,1,16,i,247</p>

<p>You can send a midi sysex message to the midi DIN output, but you need to build a custom object to do this. </p>
<p>Here's the relevant code to transmit a single sysex string of 14 bytes (including header and footer):</p>

              <p>MIDI implementation in 2.0 is significantly different, it introduced virtual MIDI ports layer and other things. <br>(that's the reason for me to keep at least one board at 1.0.12, because it serves MIDI routing via Miditech MIDIface 8x8. in new implementation virtual 8 MIDI i/o ports just can't address 16 physical i/o ports of MIDIface. in 1.0.12, i have all of them working, plus Axoloti's own MIDI DIN ports, totally 18.)</p>
