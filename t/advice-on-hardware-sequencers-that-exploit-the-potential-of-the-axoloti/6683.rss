    <title>Advice on hardware sequencers that exploit the potential of the Axoloti</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/advice-on-hardware-sequencers-that-exploit-the-potential-of-the-axoloti/6683</link>
    <description>I&#39;m enjoying building intricate sounds with the Axoloti (well, or reusing patches from the community that do that for me), for now I&#39;m using it in conjunction with a Novation Circuit MonoStation in order to deepen the sound, add polyphony etc.
But the sequencing capabilities of the mono station are... subpar to say the least (you can&#39;t sequence several notes on the same step, even if you can play several notes live at the same time (it works fine with a polyphonic patch on the Axoloti) and it can sequence only 2 tracks, because well that&#39;s what it&#39;s made for), though I like playing on it. The pads are good and velocity-sensitive, settable scales with 4 octaves in range, it&#39;s great, better than a keyboard since I&#39;m no pianist, and you can get some nice first synth drafts. So I use it mostly as a scratchpad for ideas.

However, I noticed how WAAAAY faster it is for me to go through composition with dedicated hardware rather than with a DAW. So I&#39;m wondering what people here use to that end, as my main synth will be the Axoloti (too much gear is too much, modular&#39;s not for me and if I need more power for even more complicated synth, well I can just buy a second Axoloti or use my laptop).
I&#39;ve seen videos and reviews on, like, all of them (stuff from Elektron, Akai, Synthstrom, Squarp, Toraiz, even the arcanic DIY midiphy stuff or the unaccessible/crazy expensive Cirklon or not-released-yet stuff like Polyend Tracker).

I&#39;d really like something that has the flexibility to send as many notes as the Axoloti can handle (so 8 tracks is like a super bare minimum), that is not locked into a quaternary time grid, one note per step and fixed pattern lengths. Ideally for 600€ or less (second-hand or not) but I guess I can (and should ^^) be flexible on that.

The 3 on top of my list for now are (1) Synthstrom Deluge (of course), (2) Squarp Pyramid (of course again) and (3) Polyend Seq. But the downsides of them are (1) it&#39;s a bit above my price tag even in second-hands, (2) it has only 16 pads, so it means some menu scrolling etc. to edit and work through your song so not super convenient and (3) above the price tag (esp. given it has only 8 tracks, yes I know I&#39;m spoiled, I come from PCs and DAWs and I don&#39;t like low arbitrary upper-bounds of any sort) and quite big and more difficult to transport in just a bag.
But I know some people around here have a Pyramid and love it, so maybe I can be convinced :) plus I&#39;m not afraid of some steep learning curve or 2- or 3-key shortcuts (I develop using emacs everyday, for those who know).

Playing live is not my main goal (just hitting play, occasionally switching patterns and fiddling some encoders is good enough for me), but iterating fast, easily working with odd time signatures and not having to hack around like crazy with note offsets to put together some simple triplets/quintuplets in a 4/4 track are.
Also if I can be free from wall sockets that could be great (internal battery or external power bank, don&#39;t care).

...and also I need it for tomorrow (/kidding).</description>

<p>i have fetish for sequencers, Pyramid is №1 in my personal chart. <br>№2 is Roland MC-80, and №3 is shared between E-Mu Command Station and Yamaha RM1x. but those are too big &amp; heavy for 2020. </p>

<p>interesting. <br>i've recently bought two Mono Stations. using both with Axoloti as MIDI processors and FX units (all FX patches found here). <br>btw, i've reverse engineered Mono Station patch SysEx format. it's only 136 bytes, so it's <strong>probably</strong> possible to use Axoloti as additional patch storage for Mono Station, overcoming its 64 patches limit. did not try it yet, but i already know that there's no problems with sending SysEx of this length from Axoloti.</p>

              <p>I'm really tempted to get a NeoTrellis just as a playing surface. But the issue is that it seems it can be powered only via USB, and the Axoloti only has one USB port for a MIDI device and doesn't support USB hubs, say the docs (I don't know if hubs support is planned).<br>I could plug my Pyramid (now that I have one ^^) via MIDI, but then I'd need a separate power plug/bank because the Pyramid can't be powered over MIDI, so it's less nomad, and I'd like a good playing surface to complement the sequencer that's easy to carry, specifically for that purpose (my mono station works well as a stationary playing surface, or my Roli lightpad, which is rather difficult to use nomadly without a laptop or an iPhone, which I don't have).</p>

<p>Do you guys know of a small and thin MIDI pads surface (like 8x4 pads) that could be powered via MIDI (or possibly via an internal battery)? I know the Axoloti can power stuff over MIDI from <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/bluetooth-le-midi/3967/6">that thread</a>.</p>

I know the Pyramid wasn't made for playing anyway (no velocity etc), but even to program steps it could be nicer.</p>

<p>Not 100% sur what that mean.</p>

<p>Does that mean that you have to connect it to an Arduino and then to Axoloti?</p>

<p>There is also a limit to Organelle. But for making logic stuff, I'd say it's pretty hard to reach that limit.</p>

              <p>Axoloti (in my opinion), specially for creating synths and FX is much quicker and "better sounding" .  I wish I could find the same bandlimited oscillators in pd or some saturating objects, or some of the effects..  Also, Axoloti provides the Hardware part.. I have things connected to the gpios, I use the din- midi and I still plug something else to the usb-host in the axoloti and pass it thru to Organelle. <br>Organelle in the other hand, (or puredata).  Doesn't have a limit regarding how many objects you can use and also I find it quicker to make logic stuff (like a complex multichannel sequencer with lots of screen feedback).

              <p>Sounds like you've already done some thorough research, all that stuff is just always too expensive... I have also looked for the right sequencer for a long time and then decided to get the Deluge. It's the most expensive thing I've owned so far and I had to sell some other equipment and get cheaper stuff in exchange - until now I'm pretty happy with that.</p>

<p>The only cheaper alternatives that come to my mind (and weren't already mentioned) are getting a used Akai MPC 1000 or a (huge) Yamaha RS 7000. Both are very capable sequencers and superior to all the overhyped Elektron machines when it comes to track count, polyphony and so on, but are of course not very portable and have a dated workflow.</p>

<p>There are also a few more modern contenders I don't know much about: 1010music blackbox (probably fiddly touchscreen action) and the new Roland MC grooveboxes (101 and 707). Or wait until Behringers "Jam" is ready...</p>
