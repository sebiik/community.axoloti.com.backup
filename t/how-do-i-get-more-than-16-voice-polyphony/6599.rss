    <title>How do I get more than 16 voice polyphony?</title>

    <description>Hey :) 

I am working on a patch where I think it would be nice with more than 16 voices polyphony.

But when making a patcher/patch object polyphonic, you &quot;only&quot; get up to 16 voices, you can&#39;t set more than that.

I tried embedding the polyphonic subpatch and switching out the attr_poly values everywhere in the patch with a static const of 32. It didn&#39;t seem to work. Also a bit impractical cause then the object will be code only and you can edit it as a regular subpatch.

I also tried changing one of the numbers from the attribute dropdpwn menu, but it didn&#39;t seem to do the job either. I got an error:
&quot;Error: object &quot;patcher_1&quot; attribute &quot;poly&quot;, value &quot;16&quot; unmatched&quot;

Well I only get the above error when the patcher that I embedd has some content, if I do it on a clean patcher/patch, I didn&#39;t get that error.

Anyway, I was wondering if anyone has suggestion to making more than 16 voices polyphony?</description>

              <p>Yes it definitely is nice to be able to see the content, it makes it a lot easier understanding what's going on behind the curtains in subpatches.</p>

<p>I was thinking maybe just coding it instead. </p>

<p>I will check the object, thanks <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>nice, never noticed that you can look at the code of the patcher itself by using the menu-option on top of the screen. Seems like some nice usable codes to "abuse"!<br>Anyways, I then tried to edit the poly-attribute and also adding an extra attribute, but it seems the patcher won't update it's attribute controls. So I guess it Ã­s actually hard coded somewhere in the software..</p>

              <p>I tried again just now and if I DON*T embedd the patcher/patch object I don't get any errors. I put the right names and number in CEntries and MenuEntries. Looks like this:</p>

</div></a></div></p>

<p>Bus as you can see on the picture I can still only select the first 16.</p>

<p>But If i embed the patcher/patch, then I am able to edit the patch/patcher object, but then I get the error and it won't work, when the attribute is set to the new setting. I think this is what you did too. But didn't work in practice. And embedding is probably the last way out, cause when you embed the patch/patcher, you can't edit it as a regular subpatch anymore.</p>

<p>So yeah, not there yet.</p>

<p>Yes I first changed the last value 16 to 32 and then I got the error. But jst before I went to bed last night, I tried addiing consecutive number into the menu entires, instead of just changing one number to 32, i ADDED more numbers, like 17, 18, 19, 20, etc. and then it seems to work, I don't get the error. But did not try if it out in practice yet.</p>

<p>Anyway there might have been some user error in what I did last night. So I guess I need to try with a fresh mind. So I am going for a run now and trying it out when I get home <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>I did a little testing and I cant's see anywhere in the Java nor the C code that polyphony is limited to 16 voices. The issue here might just be that the combo attribute is limited to displaying 16 distinct values (in this case, from "1" to "16").</p>

<p>In other words, I changed both the last "MenuEntries" and "CEntries" from "16" to "24" and I did get the 24 voice option (which replaced the 16 voice option). Haven't run the patch live because I usually don't work with polyphony so I wouldn't know how to best test it, but maybe you can give it a try.</p>
