    <title>A knob that adjusts Oscillator drift by percentage (Moog Beat Knob)</title>

    <description>Hello again good people!

I&#39;ve been trying all day to make a &quot;Beat&quot; knob (that mimics the famous Moog feature).   Most people think a Beat knob is a fancy term for oscillator tune, in fact it is not.    It is a percentage that it is added to your second oscillator that&#39;s based on the first oscillator frequency.    The tolerance for the Beat knob I&#39;m trying to reproduce is -/+2%.

So, say OSC1 is at 250hz, 2% of this number would be 5, so, OSC2 would do 255hz (turned fully clockwise) and 245hz (counter clockwise).   This very clever trick works very well say with bass synths.    2% of say 50hz is only 1hz more/less.   In short, the low end stays focus for those low notes and the more you climb up the keys, more of the &quot;drift&quot; is applied.

I succeeded implementing this &quot;behaviour&quot; in PureData but Axoloti is another animal.   The fact that the midi/in/keyb module outputs a bipolar value kind of throws me off.    I think I figured out how a knob would generate a -/+2 value there, but using the math/* function doesn&#39;t work, there&#39;s something I don&#39;t grasp still.

Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks in advance!

              <p>Hey Lokki,</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick answer, it worked from the get go!    Maybe 2% was a little low, so based on your "setup", I simply replaced the 0.02 multiplication by a "div 128" block (which I'm pretty sure Shift &gt;&gt; 7 bits) which gives it a range of -/+0.5 and now it's pretty damn perfect!   I didn't understand the fact that you can mix bipolar signals with a mix 1 block, thanks again for that.    Here's my final "render":</p>

              <p>0 to 64 is the full range. so 0.64x2 gives you 2 percent. so a bipolar knob followed by a multiplication by 0.02 should give you -1.28 to 1.28 range.</p>

<p>put your midi/keys output into a mix1 object (the topmost connection) and your drift knob into the other connnection. out goes to the oscillator. that should do it.</p>

<p>btw. this beat adjustment is not specific to moog, prettymuch every synth has it. detuning with a fixed amount of hz (over the whole range) may also be desirable, since you can get consistent results in all octaves. i did this with axoloti as well <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> and i think <a class="mention" href="/u/smashedtransistors">@SmashedTransistors</a> has some objects for that...</p>
