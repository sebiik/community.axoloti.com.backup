    <title>Error embedding factory pitch shifter object (Workaround)</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/error-embedding-factory-pitch-shifter-object-workaround/4415</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to embed the factory pitch shifter object that is based on Mutable Instruments&#39; clouds algorithm, but I get this error:

&quot;fatal error: ./clouds_fx.h: No such file or directory&quot;

Hopefully the solution might be as simple as navigating to the correct location of the missing external file, but I cant figure it out! Anybody knows how to fix this?

Thanks!</description>

              <p>I see. Well I just put my patch with the modified MI pitch shifter in the library build folder and it works for now. This does not matter as much because I run the axolotl in standalone mode with a midi foot controller and I only use patcher software for programming. I am happy that there is a workaround <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>yeah, there are a few issues with extending code that is located fully or partially in the firmware. <br>Originally the idea was most users would not need to extend this code, or if they did they would alter the firmware and make a custom firmware.<br>However, when we put the MI code in the firmware that has become undesirable/too complex for most. </p>

<p>So in development, we have a new concept called modules, theee allow users/libraries to have their own compilable units which can be shared, more over it also puts each module into its own namespace, this preventing name clashes and linkage issues which can also currently occur if a user attempts to override bits of the firmware code.</p>

              <p>I found out elsewhere on this forum that problem is due to the inability of embedded patches in locating included header files for their corresponding objects. Copying the header file in my patches folder didn't work. The workaround is to save the patch in the build folder, or (not recommended) to edit the XML file of the factory object. Most likely other embedded patches that rely on objects with external <span class="hashtag">#include</span> x.h files (like osc/tri) will have the same issue. So far i don't think there is any clean solutions yet. Sorry for my limited understanding of inner works of the Axoloti.</p>
