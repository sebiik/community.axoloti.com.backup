    <description>I&#39;m curious what all you guys have for ideas to use Axoloti. I noticed there isn&#39;t really a good place to post this in the forum. Maybe a separate category for ideas and discussions?

Another idea that came to mind, let do contest! Creating patches with certain rules or restriction within a week time frame and see what others can make. I this it will be a lot of fun :)</description>

              <p>I agree the less categories the better. It's something which will probably evolve over time.</p>

<p>For me it is definitely to soon to start contest or stuff like that, still gotta get a hold of the basics. Was just an idea, I'm not really an organized kind of guy so setting this up would just end in disaster, but maybe there is someone else why does have some ideas for simple projects or something like that.</p>

<p>The more ways we can connect and stay busy with Axoliti, the more we will all learn and develop this into something way bigger then we can imagine.</p>

              <p>yeah, I was going to add a 'General Category'  but feared it might mean posters just dumped everything in there... and then no one can remember where they saw that thread about X.</p>

<p>I thought that perhaps discussions specific to the hardware, software and patching might be better served being separated.<br>you can still post general topics in there, e.g. patching competitions in the patching category, <br>or an idea you've had for a hardware device etc... and of course ideas about the firmware/UI can be posted in the software category.</p>

<p>so post where you think is most appropriate, and if it becomes clearer we need a broader category I'll create one.<br>(its very tempting to create lots of categories as a moderator, but I think most users like to have as few as possible <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile"> )</p>

<p>one thing to consider (and I don't have the numbers), a good percentage of the boards have now been shipped, but many will still be 'in shipping', even within Europe it will often be 5-7 days, and could be longer for other parts of the world.... and then as you know, Axoloti is pretty deep, so going to take a while for many to get their heads around it.<br>so perhaps wait a little, till people get their boards for competitions etc?</p>

<p>anyway just thoughts, feel free to throw ideas out there to the community and see what sticks <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/raised_hands.png?v=0" title=":raised_hands:" class="emoji" alt="raised_hands"></p>
