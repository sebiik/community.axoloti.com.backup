<blockquote><p>It's a definite improvement, but why add another button instead of just moving the existing one to the right?</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>My guess is that the lay out is that it is based on the design of the Organelle, as I mentioned earlier. Organelle uses the left most button as a selector button. So by adding the extra button, you get the 16 buttons AND get to keep the selection button.</p>

        <p>Ah I see, but the goal should be to make it work for Axoloti, and in this case I would still ditch that orphan key and replace it with two buttons used for + and - instead.</p>

<p>That way you would have something along-side the steps that can be used to select 1-16, 17-32 etc.  Or like I said, simply ditch the key altogether as you have two displays on this thing anyway, both with two buttons underneath, so even those could be used for such a task.</p>

        <p>After the deep passsion i have seen here for 16 buttons i have been emotionally moved to add anouther button! jks it was actully always meant to have 16 i just forgot to add anouther button after i decided it needed a modifier button so crisis averted.</p>

<p>Thanks everyone for the feedback made me reconsider some things first i'd just like to say that this is basiclly the first pass on ui and a lot of the awkwardness is purely a result of trying to fit it all around the cutouts and header for axoloti i think it can be definitely improved but it's hard to move the pots out of the way or add a second row without creating a lot of dead space at the top of the device there's already more than i would like.</p>

<blockquote><p>Another mistake that is often made (also demonstrated in your prototype), is the use of encoders in odd numbers.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>As far as the 5th pot it is there entirely to act as a control and can be reassigned by the user if they really want as i don't see a reason to prevent someone from doing so. Your assumption that it was a 5th pot does however make it clear that putting it some close to main values is confusing so i will be moving it to a more sperate location and properly diffrentalting it with a diffrent knob type.</p>

<p>The was orginally planning on two joyticks but ran out of pins what i think might to on the on a public version an assuming there there remain space after iterating on the layout is have a postion for the joytick on both wired to the same pin allowing people to pick which side will have the stick.</p>

<blockquote><p>One idea would be to do all the digital IO via MIDI instead of explicitly using digital IO pins. You could make the controller more reusable away from an Axoloti.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p> I've considered this approach but i'd much rather have the pins accessible directly and have a object that just truns it into a midi keyboard  than implementing all the LED's and gate outputs the onyl reason i really see to do it is if runn the io is going ot be a massive resource hog which i don't think it will be so the jury out till  after the first prototype on that.</p>

<blockquote><p>I'd also suggest thinking about the software integration.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>Yeah software is going to be a big part of this. The project is mainly about creatring a platform for some more plug and play axoloti patches  and building on some really good existing community work. I'm working on this with a friend who's studying electrical engineering currently and were hoping get things like a navigatable menu/parameter slection going and some polished patches for sequencing. Although i want to very clear this is probs going to be decently far out on the timeline.</p>

<blockquote><p>Just glancing at this another thing came to mind: why not just run 3.3V logic for everything? For example U5 is running on +5V VCC but then it looks like it potentially drives MISO on PA6.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>Based on my reading ofsome old forum posts that pin should be 5v tolerent  but now that you've brought it up i am unsure. I've gone with 5v as it lets me do the gate outputs easily and the led's are 5v since it's already on the board i figured i'd take advantage of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>awesome project! i agree with most of the constructive criticism in here, also wanna add you are currently kinda wasting space on the frontplate.</p>
<p>what about something like this? you can never have too many pots..</p>
<p>fp.jpg1500x660 99.4 KB</p>
<p>oh also did you consider replacing the bicolor LEDs with WS2812 RGB?<br>and then since you're thinking eurorack i assume, you might wanna look into adding CV in out. but that could also be handled by another expansion frontplate i guess.</p>
</blockquote></aside>

<p>The extra pots you added sit right on top of the axoloti unfortunately so adding more pots will substaully increase the size of thing unless people are okay with having them orphened in strage places right now it's around 265mmX120mm which is feeling kind of big to me. </p>

<p>Considered doing RGB bbut honestly could think if why you'd need more than 3 colours on those buttons.</p>

<p>CV would be cool but requires a decent amount of extra components and given my realtive newness to electronics have penciled that away for a future revison/at the very least after i have a working prototype of the current featre setwith most of it working.</p>

<blockquote><p>Is there some reason I'm not aware of, why we have to have that orphan key in the bottom left?</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>I envision it as a modifier key akin to shift where you can hold it down while pressing another button or knob to get a diffrent function and hitting it with your pinky felt like a natral place for it mabe making the button a diffrent shape would better differentiate it's function and help it sit better visually.</p>

Your latest diagram shows exactly what I was getting at regards a group of four, and placing the buttons beneath the encoders - now <em>that</em> makes sense!</p>

<p>Neither the original design or Weasel's did.  The good thing about Weasel's version is it makes good use of space, but the bad thing about it is that the button positions do not correlate to the encoders.</p>

<p>You have fixed this in your new bank of four diagram, and that's a big-ass improvement right there, so the next task in design is to place that bank in the right place <em>and</em> in context of the other controls on the panel.</p>

        <p>one more thought, bear in mind you can get most encoder models with a built in switch, so you might not actually want an extra button beneath every single encoder? in general i don't see the use case for a direct conncetion/linear mapping between encoder and button? other than a main "data entry"/"preset" encoder maybe</p>

<p>also i am a bit confused as to why the position of the axo board would matter? won't it be underneath the frontplate, within an enclosure? you should easily be able to put buttons and encoder to whereever you hide the axo board in the back?</p>

<p>i think rgb leds do make a lot of sene in a step sequencer, you could easily indicate different trigger types/samples/velocities etc. or switch colour between banks etc.</p>

<p>i really welcome this! bear in mind that with encoders you need some kind of visual feedback to see where the value is. propably that would be the display on the right. as you maybe wanna display 4 values that could be a bit bigger?</p>

<p>One thing to consider with display is also that they should stay readable when you're on the controls.</p>

<p>Illuminated push buttons got nixed as they add about $15 to the cost vs seperate buttons and led's + anouther $20 for button caps that are designed to illuminated i'm trying to keep the cost as low as possible if people want to build at home and for my student budget (right now it's sitting at around $35aud (21 euros)) If there's enough intrest i might consider a varient with illuminated buttons since the electronics would be pretty much the same.</p>

<p>I've seen your project previously and think it looks fantastic would have bought some if the Australian dollar didn't fare so badly against the euro. As for as somthing simlar for this that would be cool but is going to limit it's diy ability and push the cost up substatually.</p>

        <p>So i've had some time to do a second pass on that layout the first pass was oviouly a bit of mess and was mostly derived from where i found space on the pcb in order to be able to fit everything in with minimal dead space i've decrated the height of the device and widened it to around 31cm which should make the buttons a lot more comfortable to use and of course added the 16th step and some +-/modifier buttons on either side of the step sequencer.</p>

<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/f0b537de31d1d3ccd2bf8921ec012d463e019463" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f0b537de31d1d3ccd2bf8921ec012d463e019463.png" class="lightbox" title="image.png"><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/f/f0b537de31d1d3ccd2bf8921ec012d463e019463_1_690x235.png" width="690" height="235"><div class="meta">
<span class="filename">image.png</span><span class="informations">1793x611 78.5 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>
</div></a></div></p>

<p>Current concerns i have with this layout are the bank buttons not clearly indicating that they are linked to bank selection rather than the values of 4 main encoders but having them where they are is a much more effiecnt use of space so that might be a necessary compromise that can be ajusted for by labeling he front plate.</p>

<p>Also keep in mind that there might soon be a more powerful Axoloti board around, created by <a class="mention" href="/u/urklang">@urklang</a>, which is probably going to be the future of Axoloti.</p>

        <p>That's looking way better, Tim, and I like that it has some symmetry to it now, looks a heck of a lot more tidy.  Being the stubbornly honest chap I am though, I'm still gonna pick out two personal dislikes about it.</p>

<p>The first thing that stands out as odd is the offset position of the buttons under the knobs.  To fix that, I would put the buttons directly beneath the knobs, and instead, put the indicators to the side of the buttons rather than offsett the buttons themselves.  This would make it look less odd or skewed, this is because the positions of the buttons and knobs are more noticable than the positions of indicators.</p>

<p>The other thing that stands out as odd is the shape of those bottom corner buttons (yuck).  I understand why you did that due to the shape of the case, but to be honest I preferred the hard corners of the original case over the rounded ones of the new one.  One other thing to bear in mind is manufacture, cause I'm guessing it will be more difficult and expensive to manufacture the round-cornered case anyway.</p>

<p>That said, I'm just being brutally honest with you; design is my thing and I don't believe in blowing smoke up anyone's backside when they ask for opinions on something regards design.  So, other than the two things I just pointed out, I think it's very nice!</p>

        <p>Actually, I'd like to add a third dislike about that design.  It has to do with the graphic strip you've placed along the top because it creates two problems that would not otherwise even exist.</p>

<p>The first problem it creates is that is makes the unit look smaller than it is.  The second problem it creates is that it's driving you to waste panel space at the top.  If it were not for that strip, there would be no need to offset buttons or indicators in order to keep it looking tidy.</p>

<p>So the strip doesn't work, it creates two problems and basically, solves nothing.  I also think the unit would look better without the strip anyway.</p>

<p>I think the strip is there because the midi and USB ports need more clearance than the rest of the components, so this has to be done to keep the whole unit from being too thick.</p>

        <p>To be honest I never imagined it being <em>that</em> small.  Why does just about everyone lately seem to have this obsession with things being so small?</p>

<p>When it comes to physical interaction, small is no good, small is bad ergonomics, small is a PITA, and small will always be outclassed by big (as no doubt KORG are learning the hard way <em>right now</em> with Behringer on the scene with their full-sized key Odyssey for a fraction of the price of the <em>utterly pointless</em> down-sized KORG).</p>

<p>I'm guessing Roland are another brand who will never learn <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/roll_eyes.png?v=5" title=":roll_eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":roll_eyes:"></p>

<p>I get that people like portable, but does it have to be <em>so</em> thin that the layout is physically effected by it?</p>

<p>The same problem is true with modern cameras, they're nowhere near as nice to use as the older stuff, and mainly it is down to poor ergonomics cause they're <em>too</em> small.  I could go on, but don't worry, I won't.</p>

        <p>This is shaping up v nicely. I will be picking up a second axoloti when urklangs new H7 based board comes out, think I might have to pair it with a heron control board when you're done <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
