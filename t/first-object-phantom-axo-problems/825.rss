    <title>First object, phantom .axo problems?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/first-object-phantom-axo-problems/825</link>
    <description>Started looking into custom axo&#39;s this morning and ran into some more user ignorance on my part. Initially I was using the default objects path for creating new axo&#39;s:

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Axoloti\app\objects\`

I added my own directory and copied an existing axo over to get started. I made some simple changes and got it loading, but during this process realized I could add another object search path to my preferences, so I moved the .axo over to my github directory, for easier access and easier source control.

So moved it over, and I deleted the original file I wrote that lived in the normal Axoloti directory:

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Axoloti\app\objects\fma_objects\fold.axo`

However during startup and anytime I reload objects I am still getting errors uuid errors with the file I nuked from the primary Axoloti directory. I even restarted my machine (both the PC and the board) just in case there was some weird .tmp file stuff going on.

Am I missing some flush command? Do things live somewhere else that I also need to delete? Is windows just fucking with me (this is normally my default answer). Has anyone else seen this behavior? I&#39;m sort of diving in head first, using this community as my how-to book, and im sure I have missed a bunch of no brainer RTM stuff.

Here is the rror just in case. I am not worried about the error itself, that seems pretty normal (I dont quite understand how to generate correct uuids yet, but thats later), but maybe they are entwined? like there is a uuid table I need to flush?

&gt; search path : objects
Incorrect uuid hash detected for object: C:\Program Files (x86)\Axoloti\app\objects\fma_objects\fold.axo , does not match its signature (439f340c2da8a031b6d48ed82626b4fbfma00002). True signature would be dfc0e2bf348b696cf099d6a3af3742792523ff20

              <p>There are no magic temp files involved here, and rebooting your PC will not solve anything (I only do that less than once a week!)</p>

<p>Easiest way out I believe is altering the upgradesha field in your object file (just use some random), and editing/saving your object with the integrated object editor (object popup menu (little triangle) -&gt; edit object definition)</p>
