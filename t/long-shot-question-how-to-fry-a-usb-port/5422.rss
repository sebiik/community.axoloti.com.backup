    <title>Long shot question: how to fry a USB port</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/long-shot-question-how-to-fry-a-usb-port/5422</link>
    <description>Hi community,

I will post my question here, though it&#39;s a long shot: A couple of months ago, my Seaboard stopped connecting via USB, just dead, wouldn&#39;t be recognized by the axo or the software on my computer. USB over bluetooth still works (the cable is ok, too!), so it really seems to be something about the USB connector on the Seaboard.
A week ago, the exact same thing happened with my other Seaboard; while plugged into the Axo, it just stopped sending. 
I did notice this time, though, that there was a weird disconnect just before. I didn&#39;t save the log, though, since I didn&#39;t think anything of it at the moment.

So, my question iiiis: Is there a theoretical possibility that something that the Axo sends/emits via USB could fry something inside the keyboard? I am not trying to put blame, I am just wondering if there even is anything electronic on the USB client side that could break, and if the host even _could_ send stuff that would have such an effect. I just find the conincidence too curious.

Evidently, I have no clue about the inner workings of MIDI or USB, so any hints would be welcome!</description>

<p>hmm, the only thing that could somehow fry an usb-port (or more likely some component behind it) would be a wrong voltage at the wrong pin. so what you could do is splice up a spare usb-cable and measure with a multimeter while the other end of the cable is connected to the usb-host port on the axoloti. you should have two data lines and ground and a 5v line. does the host port work with other gear? have you used other controllers regularly as well? the fact that the seaboard used to work with the axoloti indicates that there is nothing wrong though. have you already tried another cable? (even if the one that you have works with other stuff) see also here:</p>

              <p>Axo is only a 3.3v board, so I can't imagine it could fry any MIDI equipment.  I'm wondering if there's a 'Master Reset' on the Seaboard.  If there is, did you try disconnecting all MIDI, resetting the Seabord, and giving it another try?</p>

<p>Reason I mention it, is because if a reset were to reset the initial behaviour, it could be that something unrecognised had been sent to it and locked it up.  It wouldn't solve your problem but it might eliminate any suspicion of it being fried.</p>
