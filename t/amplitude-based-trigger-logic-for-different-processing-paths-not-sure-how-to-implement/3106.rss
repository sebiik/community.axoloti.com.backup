    <title>Amplitude-based trigger logic for different processing paths... not sure how to implement</title>

    <description>Hi all,

I&#39;m a newbie both to axoloti as well as audio processing, so I think I&#39;m having trouble figuring out how to do this just because my vocabulary isn&#39;t right.  It is a straightforward idea.

What I want to do is this:  I want to evaluate the information in a short audio buffer/table and if the mean or max(abs()) of the table elements (some test statistic basically capturing an overall amplitude) exceeds some value, I want to do one processing path, and if it is below that value, I want a different processing path.  The concept is &quot;are you giving me something loud?  then I&#39;m going to do blah blah blah.  Did you get quiet?  then I&#39;ll do this other thing.&quot;

The part I can&#39;t figure out how to do (or if I can do it with existing objects) is calculating a test statistic based on values in a short buffer.  Am I missing something obvious?  Or is this harder than it seems like it should be for some reason?  

As always, the first few questions from someone working within a wholly new framework are usually quite &quot;stupid&quot; so thanks in advance for your time and patience!</description>

              <p>Aha, vocabulary barrier strikes again!  "Envelope follower" indeed looks like what I need and I just didn't guess that from the name.  Thank you for taking the time to respond!</p>
