        <p>Hey there, so i just got into axoliti like 2 weeks ago, i want to build both a toy-ish synth for my daughter and a more serious one for myself. The architecture on both is supposed to be rather classic, 2-3 osc polyphonic, adsr for filter and amp, some effects. The osc's are supposed to be switchable between some classic VA waveforms and also most importantly some (20-30) simple rompler sample playback choices. for the bibg one i am also playing with the thought of having one axo per osc and including even more synthesis forms, fm, wavetable etc, so you could have 3 totally different osc engines running parallel. i think this would be way to much to ask from a single axo?</p>

<p>so i have a basic version running surprisingly nice already. 6 voice poly, with each voice playing a VA osc and two sample layers at the same time. here's some screenshots:</p>

</div></a></div><br>please ignore the abandoned disp and vca objects and pointless mixer channels, they were for debugging/i just now realized i should eb using the vca over the math mul, to get k-rate interpolation.</p>

<p>now what i'm looking for right now is general feedback and hints. since this is my first axo project and also the first time coding in like 20 years. i am running into CPU limitations  with this patch already (currently around 90%). While that would even be ok, i could just use 2-3 axos in series for effects and things, i am also looking for ways to optimize the CPU efficiency. eg. i think streaming from SD might make a lot of things easier and lighter on the CPU, but couldn't find a ready-made pitchable player module. i also tried benchmarking the CPU load of several OSC objects, here's my finding for 6 voice plyphony - not sure if there's a list or anything like this?</p>

<p>there's a couple more questions i have that i will keep adding to this thread, but feel free to post any notes, ideas or thoughts you guys have!</p>

<p>edit:  adding random questions here:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>does it make more sense to have the midi CCs linked in the subpatch, or copy all parameters to parent patch and assign CCs there? probably makes a difference for the preset system? same with the midi note/gate in. main patch? i probably can have one in both?</p></li>
<li><p>would love to add some meta data to each of the samples, like NAME,  LOOP START/END... how would i go aout this? do i have to manually parse a txt file from sd card or something like that? how can i dynamically assign the loop-parameters on play_pitch_loop? just add inlets instead?</p></li>
<li><p>the table load via midi cc gives me audio dropouts of about half a second and makes everything stutter while i move it. other than that it works perfect though. is that the usual loading time for a table or might that be caused by the CC sending like 100 triggers in a row. when being touched? should i insert some kind of sample&amp;hold there so that it triggers the load object at most every 300ms or something like that?<br>edit: i added a sample and hold in the midi code, while it seems to work perfectly and limits triggers to one every third of a second, i still get the dropouts. from reading the forum more i gathered this actually is the table load. clicks could be prevented with quick fades but faster sound change could only be achieved with streaming or preloading? what if i add a third table, which preloads the new sound, once its finished loading the playing table gets overwritten with the preload table - would be faster ram operations only then, no sd card involved?</p></li>
</ul>
