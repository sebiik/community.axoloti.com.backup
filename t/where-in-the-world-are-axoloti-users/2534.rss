    <title>Where in the world are Axoloti users?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/where-in-the-world-are-axoloti-users/2534</link>
    <description>Would like to put forward the idea of this link..
[http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-create-shared-collaborative-google-maps/](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-create-shared-collaborative-google-maps/)

Its an interactive global map that can be setup so members can place a marker in the area they live for all to see. (they don&#39;t advise you adding your actual address) You can even setup markers for upcoming events etc..

Its very easy to setup, and anyone can choose to add themselves, or not.
Will only be useful if enough people add themselves to it.

Thought it would be nice to see where everyone is, maybe will help bring people together, newcomers to find contacts, and will at least help me in being a little more respectful towards cultural differences.
