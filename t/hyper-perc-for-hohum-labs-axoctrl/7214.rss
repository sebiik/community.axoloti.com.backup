    <title>Hyper perc --- for Hohum Labs Axoctrl</title>

    <description>##**hyper perc** is a kick &amp; snare machine with distortion and a &#39;hyper delay&#39;. It is made to be controlled by the Hohum Labs Axoctrl.

## available for download here: &lt;a class=&quot;attachment&quot; href=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/c/cc6dc70d2d37c4af6d29e916c3e1e74738e2b486.axp&quot;&gt;hyper perc axoctrl.axp&lt;/a&gt; (53.8 KB)
&lt;/br&gt;
Originally I wanted to learn about [creating a menu system](http://community.axoloti.com/t/creating-a-menu-system/7181) by using just a few knobs &amp; buttons. I was making a patch to try making a menu system. It eventually turned into this percussion machine that I wanted. 

The hyper delay is a really short delay that only goes up to 85ms. The delay time can either be modulated by the envelope follower (before distortion &amp; delay), and by a quick LFO. It also includes a distortion section with tone control. 

It&#39;s called **hyper perc** because there are [a few videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nJ7535X5pM) that shows you how to make a percussion/snare sound like the ones you heard in hyperpop music; a kind of music that become popular recently with artists like 100 gecs &amp; SOPHIE. A lot of percussion in hyperpop are tonal &amp; spatial, and a short delay with high feedback will produce a tone out of any sound while also giving the sound space. 

the demo video below uses the iPad to sequence the kicks
_listen in headphones or good speakers_

## UPDATE: here&#39;s a guide

the hyper perc has 3 pages; hard **kick**, snap **snare**, and an FX section called hyper **delay** 
- the kick can only be played with midi channel 1
- the snare can either be played with midi channel 2, or with the snare trigger button
- every page has an extra function by pressing the extra feature button
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5a7da07fcbfabb55eaaa3255b6860967f304ebc8.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;430&quot;&gt;

**here are what all the buttons &amp; knobs do in each page**

## **hard kick**

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/4/458115cf2ea7b5957217dec382ec657007d15aba.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;430&quot;&gt;

* the oscillator is from Mutable Instruments Braids Sinefold oscillator, so you can change the wavefold amount if needed in the patch. 
* the kick will sustain just like 808 bass if you hold down a note. 
* there&#39;s also a glide function to imitate gliding 808 bass. the glide amount is only adjustable in the patch.
* it can only be played through MIDI Channel 1, but you can change the channel number in the patch.

## **snap snare**

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/2/280f34157464d032a2564d9f6379e96e7a234de8.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;430&quot;&gt;

* the snare is from Mutable Instruments Braids Snare oscillator
* the snap function is a short pitch envelope amount that you can apply to the pitch. adjust the envelope decay time if needed in the patch.
* if you could barely hear the snare, try turning down the gain of the kick

## **hyper delay**

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7849223083b17cdc66405770dcf0b8cb8dd7dbf8.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;430&quot;&gt;

* this page is an effects section that contains distortion with tone control and a short stereo delay called &#39;hyper delay&#39;
* the distortion goes before a limiter that sends the drum sounds to the delay.
* the delay goes up to only 85ms, but you can adjust the delay time with the two knobs on the bottom left. 
* shorter delay times with a high feedback creates a tone. use the feedback tone and experiment with how it sounds.
* the delay time can be modulated with an envelope follower in the patch. the envelope follower signal is the top bar of the volume meter on the screen. set the &#39;env mod&#39; to middle position for no modulation. 
* the delay time can also be modulated by a quick sine LFO. you can adjust the LFO rate by yourself in the patch by adjust the sine LFO object **(drj/lfo/sin_4_p)**
* the tone control is actually a parametric EQ. you can adjust different settings like EQ gain, resonance/width, and frequency in the patch with the BiQuad filter object **(sss/filter/BiQmd)**.
* pressing the extra feature button turns on a high pass filter for the delay. in the patch it&#39;s a stereo filter **(sss/filter/endBand)** and you can adjusts its settings like high shelf freq or low pass freq in the patch.



**plans:**
1. polish the patch to make it look tidier
2. add external input
3. turn the &#39;fx send&#39; into a &#39;dry/wet&#39;
4. switching out the snare to another instrument
5. trigger the kick and snare on the device instead of just the snare</description>
