    <description>!

Got my AxoCore few days ago and start to integrate it into my studio and workflow. 

In my studio I use XP based PC (some of my outboard stuff from the past century can run on XP only).

In this thread I&#39;ll report some issues and workarounds with Axoloti on Windows XP. 

I haven&#39;t placed this topic in helpdesk category or something because XP does not listed as supported OS and it&#39;s just a fluke to see that the patcher is working with it. I just think it can be useful for some lonely XP users )

So, one by one.

1. When I had connected Axoloti to PC at first time (after installing axoloti_runtime and axoloti application, of course) Windows, as expected, starts to install drivers for Axo, but it couldn&#39;t find drivers for &quot;Axoloti Bulk Interface&quot;. There was no success also when I had pointed Windows to that folder with winusbcompat drivers. After doing some research I found that zadig_2.1.2.exe from Program Files\axoloti_runtime\platform_win does not run on XP because the version that included in runtime can only be run on Vista or later. Then I downloaded the proper version of zadig (zadig_xp_2.12.exe) from http://zadig.akeo.ie/, placed it into the runtime directory and ran it. Next I have installed winUSB driver for &quot;Axoloti Bulk Interface&quot;. Since that moment all things are going as they should and the patcher can see the Axo.

2. Since the 1.0.5 was released, the Axoloti.exe can not be started from Program Files\Axoloti. Now you can only get the patcher running if you launch the axoloti-app.jar file from Program Files\Axoloti\app.</description>

              <p>Just a heads-up to confirm that indeed, using a username without spaces won't change anything.  Mark already pointed this out, but I just had to reinstall on another hard drive cause the other failed - so I though I might as well try it anyway.  So this time I chose a username without spaces, and everything went exactly as before, therefore I still had to set-up the AXOLOTI_HOME variable manually again.</p>

<p>The good news of course is that I know it can be repeated and work perfectly if something screws-up again if I decide to stay with this system.</p>

              <p>There was only SP3, Blender, VLC, and my Canon printer drivers installed at the time, and I only installed SP3 because I originally thought the lack of it was stopping the Axoloti Patcher installer from running.  But that was before I asked and Mark pointed out it needs to be installed in another working environment first.</p>

<p>I don't think I did anything wrong to the installation, although I might have done and not realised it.  It's not impossible considering the amount of messing around I've had to do with OS installations lately.</p>

<p>Worth it in the end though, looking forward to finally playing with it again this afternoon <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>

<p>no, as I stated, these are override variables... to allow users to change the default behaviour.<br>within the code, we already use defaults.. but that defaulting appeared to not work in your scenario (and is one of the reasons we are not support XP, since it might have different operating system defaults, so requires different code)</p>

    Some users may need to use different directory locations for their setup, due to permissioning or using things like remote profiles. 

important note This is considered advanced use only, you must know how to configure for your operating system. Incorrect usage will cause issues. Also it will make it difficult for others to support you, since your files will not be in the 'usual' locations, an assumption most will make.

<p>That was the first time I ever had anything to do with a system variable.  I found the panel where all the variables are handled, but neither of those variables were listed, they simply were not there to start with, so nothing to edit.  Anyway, I added a new one and named it AXOLOTI_HOME, and gave it the value by copy/pasting the correct path.</p>

<p>After that, I had to remove, reconnect, reset all, sync libraries again, and now it works.  I've even tested the card this time by uploading that formatter object to it, and even that works.</p>

              <p>Wow, that's <em>really</em> odd.  I've absolutely <em>no idea</em> why it made a folder called "axolotiments", and I assure you, it certainly wasn't me <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/open_mouth.png?v=5" title=":open_mouth:" class="emoji" alt=":open_mouth:"></p>

<p>Regards the space in the path name, that part is my fault cause when I installed Windows XP, I called the default user "User 1". But ok then, I'll look into changing that variable, and if it works I'll reinstall Windows XP again and use a name without spaces next time.  Tell you what though, that "axolotiments" path was not there last time, because I followed the path it was complaining about, and yes, the file is there.</p>

<p>I think I've aquired an Axoloti with a mind of her own - she wants to play games?<br>Right, I'll give her games, I'll tame her ...</p>

<p>so it cant find the generated source file.<br>is it there?<br>(path looks incorrect to me)</p>

<p>I guess something to do with the spaces in the filenames and xp...<br>one possibility is to move the home directory to somewhere else, without spaces in it.<br>the override the environment variable <span class="bbcode-s">HOME_DIR</span> AXOLOTI_HOME to point to the new location.</p>

              <p>Damn, it still isn't working, I thought it was!</p>

<p>The patcher is working, it connects and disconnects perfectly, recognises the Axoloti etc.  But I just tried to upload a patch to it and it keeps throwing up an error, the part highlighted in red basically telling me that it cannot find the file "xpatch.bin".  I've checked the directory it says it's looking for it, and the file is there!</p>

<p>Any idea what's causing this?</p>

<p>I thought I was finally in a position to take a look at that Sample Scrubber and VHS patch Lokki and Krikor made, and now this, damn stubborn thing!</p>

              <p>Im not really sure how you got into this state.... as depends what you did.<br>but basically, you have ended up on the master branch of the libraries rather than 1.0.12</p>

<p>if your online (which you'll need to be to sync with the libraries), then you simply need to do preferences-&gt;reset all</p>

<p>(if you search on this forum, you will see others have had similar issues at times)</p>

              <p>Well, I've set-up internet on the XP box now, tested and working, so no problem there.</p>

<p>Trouble is, it will not sync at all.  The good thing is it's not unique to the XP box, cause it happens on the Windows 7 box as well.  What I do is connect the board, start Axoloti Core, it says there's a library mismatch and would I like to sync?</p>
