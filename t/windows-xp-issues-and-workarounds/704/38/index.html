Got my AxoCore few days ago and start to integrate it into my studio and workflow.

        <p>Damn, it still isn't working, I thought it was!</p>

<p>The patcher is working, it connects and disconnects perfectly, recognises the Axoloti etc.  But I just tried to upload a patch to it and it keeps throwing up an error, the part highlighted in red basically telling me that it cannot find the file "xpatch.bin".  I've checked the directory it says it's looking for it, and the file is there!</p>

<p>Any idea what's causing this?</p>

<p>I thought I was finally in a position to take a look at that Sample Scrubber and VHS patch Lokki and Krikor made, and now this, damn stubborn thing!</p>

        <p>Cheers Mark, I'll split it into two parts so you can see what happens when I first start the Axoloti Patcher, and then what happens when I try to upload a patch to it.</p>

<p>so it cant find the generated source file.<br>is it there?<br>(path looks incorrect to me)</p>

<p>I guess something to do with the spaces in the filenames and xp...<br>one possibility is to move the home directory to somewhere else, without spaces in it.<br>the override the environment variable <span class="bbcode-s">HOME_DIR</span> AXOLOTI_HOME to point to the new location.</p>

        <p>Wow, that's <em>really</em> odd.  I've absolutely <em>no idea</em> why it made a folder called "axolotiments", and I assure you, it certainly wasn't me <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/open_mouth.png?v=5" title=":open_mouth:" class="emoji" alt=":open_mouth:"></p>

<p>Regards the space in the path name, that part is my fault cause when I installed Windows XP, I called the default user "User 1". But ok then, I'll look into changing that variable, and if it works I'll reinstall Windows XP again and use a name without spaces next time.  Tell you what though, that "axolotiments" path was not there last time, because I followed the path it was complaining about, and yes, the file is there.</p>

<p>I think I've aquired an Axoloti with a mind of her own - she wants to play games?<br>Right, I'll give her games, I'll tame her ...</p>

        <p>Don't bother with the username, that's probably not going to help </p>

<p>Use axoloti_home variable this is what it's for, to be able to override the default home directory.  </p>

<p>As for the oddity, could be any number of things, I can't know for sure without running it myself - this is  why we test software on different versions of OSs, and why we don't support older versions. </p>

<p>also bare in mind , older OSs do have bugs that have been fixed in newer versions, and behavior that has been altered - hence compatibility issues.</p>

        <p>It has happened, I have tamed her, she's on her knees begging for patches now!</p>

<p>That was the first time I ever had anything to do with a system variable.  I found the panel where all the variables are handled, but neither of those variables were listed, they simply were not there to start with, so nothing to edit.  Anyway, I added a new one and named it AXOLOTI_HOME, and gave it the value by copy/pasting the correct path.</p>

<p>After that, I had to remove, reconnect, reset all, sync libraries again, and now it works.  I've even tested the card this time by uploading that formatter object to it, and even that works.</p>

<p>Thanks again for sticking with me on this <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/sunglasses.png?v=5" title=":sunglasses:" class="emoji" alt=":sunglasses:"></p>

<p>no, as I stated, these are override variables... to allow users to change the default behaviour.<br>within the code, we already use defaults.. but that defaulting appeared to not work in your scenario (and is one of the reasons we are not support XP, since it might have different operating system defaults, so requires different code)</p>

        <p>There was only SP3, Blender, VLC, and my Canon printer drivers installed at the time, and I only installed SP3 because I originally thought the lack of it was stopping the Axoloti Patcher installer from running.  But that was before I asked and Mark pointed out it needs to be installed in another working environment first.</p>

<p>I don't think I did anything wrong to the installation, although I might have done and not realised it.  It's not impossible considering the amount of messing around I've had to do with OS installations lately.</p>

<p>Worth it in the end though, looking forward to finally playing with it again this afternoon <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>

        <p>Just a heads-up to confirm that indeed, using a username without spaces won't change anything.  Mark already pointed this out, but I just had to reinstall on another hard drive cause the other failed - so I though I might as well try it anyway.  So this time I chose a username without spaces, and everything went exactly as before, therefore I still had to set-up the AXOLOTI_HOME variable manually again.</p>

<p>The good news of course is that I know it can be repeated and work perfectly if something screws-up again if I decide to stay with this system.</p>
