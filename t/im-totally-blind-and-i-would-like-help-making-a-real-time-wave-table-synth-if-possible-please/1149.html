        <p>hello every one, i'm trey from the uk and i'm totally blind. </p>

<p>for a wile now i've been wanting access to wave table synthesis, current hardware and software wave table synths are not accessible to me as a totally blind electronic mussision. </p>

<p>There for i'm wondering would it be possible to use Axolotl to create a wave table synth that could be used stand alone and controlled with physical controls and in real time with out a computer. As I have know DIY or coding ability I would have to get some one to make this for me with my input in to the project and I wouldn't mind paying for the time or conponits. </p>

<p>How possible do you all think this dream of mine could be? </p>

<p>Your help with this idea would be most welcome, kind regards trey.</p>

        <p>Hello mate and welcome <img src="http://community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>Interesting. I have worked a little bit on a real time wavetable synth. I was basicly inspired by a plug in made by an electronic music group called Infected Mushroom. They have created a plug in called "I wish" which is a real time wavetable synth. But it can also do so much other things.</p>

<p>Check trhis link. There is video as well as audio clips:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/infected-mushroom-present-the-i-wish-granular-note-freezing-plugin-631043" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/infected-mushroom-present-the-i-wish-granular-note-freezing-plugin-631043</a></p>

<p>You wont need coding skills for this ou can do it with Axoloti as it is now. I think you should just try it out. If you have problem let me know and I iwll help you out <img src="http://community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> But I think you should first see what you can come up with and then I can help you along <img src="http://community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> </p>

<p>Let me know if you dont know where to start <img src="http://community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>Have fun.</p>

        <p>hello, thank you <br>jaffasplaffa for your reply. </p>

<p>When I say real time I mean A wave table synth with all physical controls and no menus. </p>

<p>Also i don't think the computer interface axoloti uses to create synths and alike is accessible to screen reeders because of its graphical nature, there for I believe I would need help with every aspect of the project, i hope this helps kind regards trey.</p>

        <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="../../users/soundwarrior20.html">@soundwarrior20</a>,<br>What you describe is absolutely possible with axoloti. I myself have just built a synthesizer box (with 24 physical controls) and am working on a wavetable patch for it now. When it's done I'll be happy to share my software, bill of materials, and electrical design with the you and the rest of the community. I'm in the USA so wouldn't be able to collaborate with you in person but will happily help out with patching or instruction if you can find a qualified hacker locally (namely, someone who can read schematics, solder, and do a bit of DIY). I expect I'll be able to share more about my project next week as I'm still finishing parts of it.</p>

<p>Best of luck!</p>

        <p>thanks for your reply, <a class="mention" href="../../users/matthewcieplak.html">@matthewcieplak</a>  i'm completely new to all this <img src="http://community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> what is meant by a "wave table patch?". Also will your wave table synth be able to make the same kinds of sounds found in massive and serum? </p>

<p>And will it be completely non menu and computer based? also will you be able to use your own wave tables on it? </p>

<p>your help with these questions would be most welcome kind regards trey.</p>

        <p>Hi Soundwarrior. I seen your post on gearslutz about sequencers and I had a similar thought. Axoloti could potentially be made into a sequencer as well with accessible controls. I didn't reply on gearslutz about this because I couldn't register.</p>

<p>Does braille work inverted? If an plastic enclosure was engraved with braille could you read it? Even if the dots were going in the way instead of stick out?</p>

<p>A patch is what we call the program that runs on the Axoloti. You create it in a editor and upload it.</p>

        <p>Ahh cool. You want to build a box with knobs and faders for controlling wavetable synth. I was thinking you wanted to make a synth that created the wavetable out of incoming audio signal. What you want to do is not so complicated as the real time granular thingy <img src="http://community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>I am not into hardware modding just yet, so Ill leave this to the other guys who offered to help. I have build some patches for wavetables, that are allready on this forum. Doing a search on wavetable will bring up a lot of posts <img src="http://community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> But I was wondering what are you expectations to the wavetable synth you are looking to make? Are you looking for multiwavetable with many waves or just single waves? Do you need fx, etc. ?</p>

<p>Anyway, I have got a bahcelor degree in social education(pedagogy) and this is right up my alley. Interesting project. I have been working on a project which basicly is called "creativity with one finger". The goal is to be creative and be it with ONE FINGER ONLY. SO everyone can do this. The project is especially aimed for kids with muscular dystrophy. They often loose there feasibility over a period of time. And I want to give them nice and interesting things to to do with their lives, while they still have their feasibility. Like modern activities. My view on this is that kids with muscular dystrohpy arte often only introduced to activities that is kind of "outdated". They also want to participated in modern day activities to feel like they are a part of something bigger modern. And I think it also could help some of these kids make friends. Kids with muscular dystrophy often feels isolated. If I could put a few of these kids in a room together with a few Ipads I am sure it would be ground for a lot of creativity but also creating new meaningful friendships.</p>

<p>Anyway, let us know how it comes a long <img src="http://community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

        <p>hi, thanks for your help and ideas gang <img src="http://community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>for my wave table synth I was thinking of a multi wave table multi ossolater multi env synth with LFO filter VCA and amp, with effects and arp how ever the effects and arp are not as important as the wave table synthesis capability, in addition to all this the synth must have midi control options for setting the channel and clock source. It must be non menu based and be able to work stand-alone with out the use of a computer. I hope this helps, kind regards trey.</p>

        <p>Cool. That gives a good perspective of what you are aiming for.</p>

<p>I saw that a user posted a kind of spectral analyser some days ago. This could be used as an interactive tool for using voice and microphone for controlling Axoloti... Like for example use the pitch of your voice to scan through the wavetable. </p>

<p>Just an idea havent tested it, though. Could probably be used in many ways. Maybe there is a microphone placed in the room, that picks up the ambience.... Which then triggers a different wavetable depending on which frequency comes into the mic... <img src="http://community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>This take it a bit beyond using knobs.</p>

        <p>I thought of a text to speech module for feedback for settings/program changes etc.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11711" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11711</a></p>

<p>Could possibly be connected directly to the Axo (would reduce the pins a lot though) or driven from a Teensy or Arduino.</p>

        <p>hi all, the idea about the tts module was a good one maybe this could be used as an accessibility but on for the mutable instruments ambika or elektron products what do people think???</p>
