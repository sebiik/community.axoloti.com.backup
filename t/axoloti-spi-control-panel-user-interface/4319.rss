    <title>Axoloti SPI control panel / user interface</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/axoloti-spi-control-panel-user-interface/4319</link>
    <description>Hey Guys, 
I&#39;ve been developing an SPI hardware user interface, mainly for rapid prototype development for our own stuff, something we can re-use all the time. 
Someone mentioned that it might be something that would work well with axolti, I must admit, I hadn&#39;t heard of this before and have just been reading up about it, looks really cool. 

OnBoard: OLED display, 16 pots, 16 sliders, 32 pushbuttons, 48 LEDS and 4 rotary encoders with internal pushbuttons.

Anyways, just letting you know about it. happy to discuss how it could work with this, and we would also be publishing the libraries and firmware as open source. 

here&#39;s a pic of it.

              <p>I plan on refining it based on feedback and releasing it, yes. Even though it was intended for internal use. <br>It seems there are not many SPI control surfaces about for prototyping like this. <br>We would make the firmware open source</p>

              <p>cool could definitely work nicely with Axoloti.<br>Are you planning on releasing it ? publishing schematics? or perhaps just sell the pcb for a diy build?</p>
