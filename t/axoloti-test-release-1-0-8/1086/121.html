        <p>check your credentials etc.<br>how can you have uncommitted objects if you deleted the folder as I requested?</p>

<p>note: after the init, its possible you might have to exit axoloti and do a sync... (I cant remember this bit about how the bug existed)<br>but dont do a sync if there are un-commited objects, since thats not right... unless they are your own, and even then you should do this AFTER you have done a successful sync.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="../../../users/johannes.html">@johannes</a> we really need to get 1.0.9 out, its getting frustrating, doing workarounds for 1.0.8 when I know these were fixed months ago in dev <img src="../../../images/emoji/emoji_one/frowninga4f0.png?v=0" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

        <p>I did exactly that procedure, however after the init the contrib folder is not empty but contains a .git hidden folder.<br>And there are a lot of uncommitted objects  </p>

        <p>ok, so this is assuming you have deleted everything... </p>

<p>which is odd, that means the initial clone failed, did you get any errors in the console when you did the init().<br>can you please try it again, I cant think why it would pull the head revision, yet not download the files.</p>

<p>can you give me a screenshot of how you have configured axoloti-contrib.<br>also double check you have entered your authentication details correctly and also your contributor prefix.</p>

        <p>ok, something strange is happening... Ive just tried on windows and I'm getting the same now.</p>

<p>its weird as its not happening on Mac, and it was working on window before.... and doesn't appear to work at all now. (even without authentication) <br>I'll need to test it some more... or perhaps <a class="mention" href="../../../users/johannes.html">@johannes</a> as I cant rebuild the windows app.</p>

        <p>ok, Ive fixed it.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="../../../users/sputnki.html">@Sputnki</a> , do the init again.</p>

<p>The issue was cause by <a class="mention" href="../../../users/jaffasplaffa.html">@jaffasplaffa</a> including files with names containing ":" which are not valid under windows.<br><a class="mention" href="../../../users/jaffasplaffa.html">@jaffasplaffa</a> can you please not use 'special' characters in the filename of objects.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="../../../users/sputnki.html">@Sputnki</a> , Im a little 'unhappy' , I asked you if there were any errors in the console in the init, and there were errors about the above file.  once I saw this, it took me 2 minutes to fix... instead, Ive ended up having to install 1.0.8 on my windows system, and have had a whole number of posts going through this issue. a waste of both mine and your time.</p>

<p>please guys, read the reporting issues post I made, <a href="../../reporting-issues-bugs/21.html">http://community.axoloti.com/t/reporting-issues-bugs/21</a><br>I think its pretty obvious, that any error in the console should be included when you have issues.<br>it means less leg work for me, and faster solutions for you.</p>

        <p>no problem, in 1.0.9 you don't get to name files, it automatically names them from the object name, and so accounts for things like this <img src="../../../images/emoji/emoji_one/smilea4f0.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

        <p>I think there may be a bug related to the Glide object in 1.0.8.</p>

<p>Does the following patch loop like it should work, from the attached screenshot?</p>

<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/02102a62860d6c2efca9e3bc94cabafbd8c7f92b" href="../../../uploads/default/original/2X/0/02102a62860d6c2efca9e3bc94cabafbd8c7f92b.png" class="lightbox" title="Screen Shot 2016-03-25 at 17.12.54.png"><img src="../../../uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/02102a62860d6c2efca9e3bc94cabafbd8c7f92b_1_690x391.png" width="690" height="391"><div class="meta">
<span class="filename">Screen Shot 2016-03-25 at 17.12.54.png</span><span class="informations">1530x867 74.4 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>
</div></a></div></p>

<p>I managed to get it to work once, but there seems to be a problem with the smoothing amount- a value of 0 seems still to produce a pitch glide (where I assume it shouldn't).</p>

<p>After that one time, it appears to compile and upload (log below), but produces no audio, and there's no activity on the two scopes, either.</p>

<p>I've tried connecting a cntrl/button object to the 'en' input of the Glide object, too, with the same result- no output. With nothing connected to 'en', it works, but no glide, obviously.</p>

<p>Here's the patch in question:<br><a class="attachment" href="../../../uploads/default/original/2X/f/nmpgen3.axp">nmpgen3.axp</a> (5.6 KB) (requires my nmpgen3 object, which is in the contrib library).</p>

        <p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I've tried with the math/smooth object in place of the Glide.</p>

<p>In this case, I get the same behaviour I saw before- with smooth at 0, I still get smoothing.</p>

<p>If I try to add a multiplexer to switch between the smoothed and unsmoothed pitch (see screenshot), again it fails to make a sound.</p>

<p>I'm just trying to achieve a switched glide effect, based on a boolean output from the nmpgen3 object. I'd have thought this should be possible. Is it something to do with execution order, perhaps, and not a bug after all?</p>

        <p>no problem <a class="mention" href="../../../users/sputnki.html">@Sputnki</a> .. I recognise its hard on both sides. </p>

<p>just every now and then, Id like to remind everyone, I also prefer making music with axoloti (and my other gear),  Im just another  community member helping here, its not my job, I'm not paid etc  (like it would be for a Native Instrument support guy) , so I kind of appreciate it when others help reduce the amount I have to do to chase these things down.... I view its as a team effort, where end-users are a vital part of that team.</p>

<p>but as I said, I do recognise its not always easy for those reporting issues to know what is important and not... even on my side sometimes I miss the more obvious causes initially <img src="../../../images/emoji/emoji_one/winka4f0.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p><a class="mention" href="../../../users/toneburst.html">@toneburst</a>, id guest this is not 1.0.8 specific i.e. probably same in 1.0.6, so I suspect not high priority on 1.0.8 for fixing.  (1.0.8 does mean we can update objects between software releases, so not vital its fixed before 1.0.9 is out)  - not saying not important, just may not get priority at the moment.</p>

        <p>I see. Were you able to confirm it's a bug, just out of interest?</p>

<p>I'm a newb when it comes to using the Patcher, but I think my patch should work, conceptually, at least. The fact it Does work, with a different oscillator object suggests Bug pretty strongly to me.</p>

<p>By looking a little bit more into it, axoloti changed The names of The objects. Actually i didnt use The : sign, i used the / sign. But axoloti changed The : to /. But Will avoid using Those special characters at all. Just letters &amp; numbers?</p>

        <p>I'd avoid both.</p>

<p>The forward-slash '/' character is the path delimiter on UNIX-based systems (including OS X). It can't be used in OS X filenames, but I guess the system replaces them with ':' characters, behind the schenes, while displaying the original forward slash you typed in Finder (but not in other apps like the Axoloti patcher).</p>

<p>the substituting rule for : / is SLASH, as axoloti substitutes with words, e.g. * becomes STAR.<br>anyway, I just pushed a change for 1.0.9 that means : becomes COLON.</p>

<p>but yeah best avoid special characters, as there are quite a few that could cause issues.</p>

<p>in 1.0.9 when you use 'add to library' it shows you the filename that is going to be used, so if its still has odd characters, best not to use it ... and if its a useful one, let us know and we can ensure its gets substituted.</p>

<p>So, today I had time to change the names of the objects in Finder in OSX. Do I have to change the name of the objects in textwrangler also(the name that is shown in the editor)? Or is it enough to just change the name in Finder? </p>

<p>I dont have any Windows machine so cant really test if they would work on Windows now. </p>
