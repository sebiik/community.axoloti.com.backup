    <title>Using an audio Kick to generate a midi clock</title>

    <description>Hello everyone,

I want to implement something like these devices do:

http://www.s-n-d.com/acme4e_b.html
http://www.e-rm.de/products/multiclock.php

They take an audio signal containing a kick or a metronome on a &#39;digital input&#39;. (With a comparator / schmitt-trigger cirquid in between) and generate a midi clock from it. This is very handy, since it is not possible to sync any DAW to external gear, jitter-free, using a usb-midi-interface (There is always jitter, if USB [or firewire for that mater] is involved).

I would use one hw-timer for that in input capture mode to measure T. A second one, I would set to T/24. Unfortunately T/24 leads (most likely) to fractions, which leads to drift. Does anybody have a better idea on how to realize that?

Certainly I could always retrigger T/24 timer on rising edges on the input, which would reduce the drift to 1 quarter note, which would not be noticeable I guess. But probably there is a better approach for that. (?)

Regards
