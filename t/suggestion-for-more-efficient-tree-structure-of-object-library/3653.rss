    <title>Suggestion for more efficient tree structure of object library</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/suggestion-for-more-efficient-tree-structure-of-object-library/3653</link>
    <description>I suggest that the object library hierarchy be changed to make it more logical and easier to find and compare modules

The top level should be the list of object categories not factory or community.
each object category would have a factory path and a path for each user&#39;s contribution to that category of object.

It would make a lot more sense and save a lot of time going back and forth between the 2 branches of the current tree all the time.

Any comments?</description>
