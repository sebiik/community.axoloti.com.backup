    <title>Midi merge problems *fixed*</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/midi-merge-problems-fixed/7877</link>
    <description>Hi,

I just bought a RK-006 from Retrokits which I wanted to use to merge my &#39;Keith Mc Millen Softstep&#39; and my &#39;Fishman Tripleplay wireless&#39; together and send them to mulitple Axoloti&#39;s/midi units.

The Axoloti is receiving midi from both units in their respective channels via the RK-006. When connecting the USB from Fishman to the Axo USB input, the midi information is the same as with the RK-006. My patch however only reacts to the midi from the Fishman when it&#39;s connected to the Axoloti and not when it&#39;s connected to the RK-006.

Does anybody know why this is happening? Like I said, the midi information when monitored via the midi/monitor object is virtually the same.

Thanks!

**My patcher&#39;s midi device was still set to USB :persevere: . So just here to let you know that the RK-006&#39;s midi merge function works wonders. Truly a great device.**</description>
