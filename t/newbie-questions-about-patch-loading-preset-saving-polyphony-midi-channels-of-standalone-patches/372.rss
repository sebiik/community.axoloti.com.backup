    <title>Newbie Questions about Patch Loading, Preset saving, Polyphony, Midi Channels of standalone patches</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/newbie-questions-about-patch-loading-preset-saving-polyphony-midi-channels-of-standalone-patches/372</link>
    <description>Hi all, I&#39;ve had lots of fun creating  some instruments that are more or less ready to implement in my live sets - but I am now wondering about enclosures and building interfaces and started thinking about versatility of my instruments.

The main questions and sources of anxiety that I have now are:

How can you make a patch that has adjustable polyphony and switchable midi input/output channels?
-For polyphony I guess the easy solution would be to load different patches with the number of polyphony that you need for the situation. For midi input channels, I am not sure what is an easy workaround. I basically would be glad if I could assign controls to the drop down menus of the Polyphonic subpatch - but not sure if those paramenters are Live-switchable..

How can you save patch presets while the instrument is in live mode?
-Is it possible to create presets while the instrument is live? and what is the best practice to implement that, since I guess the presets need to be added to some sort of array.

Patches that use tables that need samples - do they need some sort of an Init Script to load up the sample once the patch is live?
-I have a button that I need to press to load the sample into a table, but i think there is a better way of doing that. I&#39;ve got tables that I want to load one of 200 samples into..would be cool if someone can give some advice about making an interface for that - otherwise i think i just make 200 string objects that get selected by some ridiculous switch system.</description>

              <p>A new version of the preset manager is up, please ref. my contribution thread for a description.</p>

<p>The functionality is now very close to 'conventional' presets. Just need two things to make that happen:</p>

<p>1 -  Get those currently non-registered parameters fixed. I still have only spotted the integer spinbox, but I haven't been searching for that  (too busy programming...).</p>

<p>2 - A list of sub patches, with something to identify each sub patch, e.g. just a sequence number or something like that, so that name clashes in the global save mode can be avoided (that is equally named parameters in different sub patches). I.e. an array of  sub patch pointer/identifier pairs.</p>

<p>The addition I suggested for xpatch.cpp is simply a list of pointers to each patch root structure. A simple NULL terminated array would do fine. The metadata stuff we briefly discussed was more theoretical.</p>

<p>From looking at ui.c, ui.h and xpatch.cpp, it seems to partly be a work in progress for the remote. If it's the intention that ObjectKvps should be a registry for all parameters, that will be a great thing to have. However, right now it looks like it's incomplete and can't be used for this.</p>

<p>My test scenario consists of a patch with one sub patch, and I'm only seeing some of the top level parameters in ObjectKvps - still with the caveat that I could be doing things wrong.</p>

<p>I've added the test scenario to the library, so that you or anybody else who knows the firmware and xpatch can have a look and see what's going on:<br>patches/drj/test/preset_manager_test.axp,<br>objects/drj/test/preset_manager_test.axo</p>

              <p>Its a bit of time (when I was doing the push stuff) since Ive played with this.</p>

<p>as far as i remember though... <br>you will see all parameters... just remember when you 'place on parent' you are really just exposing the same underlying parameter (i.e. the one in the sub patch) , so that can be confusing.</p>

<p>also as I said, I noticed some objects are not correctly registering their parameters. from memory this was some of the sel type objects.  (this is something I think we should fix.)</p>

<p>perhaps try the following...<br>create a patch with dials in the top level, and also dials in the subpatch (name them all, so you can see whats what).<br>and see if you get all the parameters.... </p>

<p>hopefully, then what we can do is go the other way, and narrow down, what is not being registered... and see if we can do this. i suspect its possible , perhaps you chose a different set of objects to the ones i did.</p>

<p>at some point, I'll create once to just print the stuff out as you did, as I cant use my push object now (traded in for  a push 2)... </p>

<p>unfortunately, as I said in my first post, its definitely 'not right' at the moment, there are 3 different structures (albeit related) doing things in this area... and I dont think any are vary consistent, or have the information we need.<br>the reason for raising this, is I suspect, we will need to tweak it all.... and the last thing I would do is create another one (e.g. adding the tree info your requesting for PExch) without reviewing it all.<br>as I said, Id put it on hold really, as I know Johannes will also need this updating for the Axoloti Control... and when we discussed it before, he did say the ui bit in firmware, was really just provisional/prototyping until Axoloti Control gets developed properly....<br>BUT... I thought its useful/important for you to know a little more about how parameters are handled... as Im sure you will have some good ideas for the future too.</p>

<p>of course my understanding may be incorrect, as I took a different approach on Push (as I wasn't storing the data), I used the global object parameter table (ObjectKvpRoot) ,  and just presented this to the user.however, this also has 'issues' as its only the underlying parameters, so it doesn't have any knowledge of a parameter being on a 'subpatch', no issue for storage, but means from a UI perspective, you cannot show parameters that have been 'placed on the parent'of course, the advantage for display, was also it has details about max/min , which aren't in PExch... unfortunately I dont think there is a relationship between PExch and the main object table (as far as i remember when playing with this) </p>
<p>here kind of illustrates where the two worlds divide:</p>
<p> parent-&gt;PExch[PARAM_INDEX_square__3_pitch].pfunction = pfun_signed_clamp;<br> SetKVP_IPVP(&amp;KVP_instancesquare__3_pitch,ObjectKvpRoot, "square_3" ,&amp;parent-&gt;PExch[PARAM_INDEX_square__3_pitch], -1&lt;&lt;27, 1&lt;&lt;27);<br> KVP_RegisterObject(&amp;KVP_instancesquare__3_pitch);</p>
</blockquote></aside>

<p>I've followed that up now, and I can't make sense of the ObjectKvps table. So far, from what I can see it only has top level patch parameters registered, and then not all of them as you mentioned, even though I see the registering calls is xpatch.cpp. Also, the registered parameters are seemingly not consistent with the SetKVP_IPVP() and  KVP_RegisterObject() calls in xpatch.cpp, among other things I can only retrieve the keyname of a few of the ipValuePair structs that are registered.</p>

<p>There is of course a good chance that I'm doing something wrong. The code below is what I use to inspect ObjectKvps ATM. It's executed at the first iteration of the preset manager module (BTW, I'm thinking of renaming it to "snapshot manager" as you suggested, to avoid confusion). </p>

<pre><code>if( start_sequence == 0 ) // Only do this on the first iteration of the module!
  {
    extern struct KeyValuePair *ObjectKvps[];

    LogTextMessage( "preset_manager::krate(): ObjectKvpRoot = %08x, ObjectKvps = %08x, n = %d", ObjectKvpRoot, ObjectKvps, ObjectKvpRoot-&gt;apvp.length );

    for( int i = 0; i &lt; ObjectKvpRoot-&gt;apvp.length; i++ )
      {
        switch( ObjectKvps[i]-&gt;kvptype )
          {
            case KVP_TYPE_IPVP :
              LogTextMessage( "KVP_TYPE_IPVP: .keyName = %s, .value = %08x",
                ObjectKvps[i]-&gt;keyname != NULL ? ObjectKvps[i]-&gt;keyname : "NULL",
                ObjectKvps[i]-&gt;ipvp.PEx-&gt;value );
              break;
            case KVP_TYPE_IVP :
              LogTextMessage( "KVP_TYPE_IPVP: .keyName = %s, .value = %08x",
                ObjectKvps[i]-&gt;keyname != NULL ? ObjectKvps[i]-&gt;keyname : "NULL",
                ObjectKvps[i]-&gt;ivp.value );
              break;
            default :
              LogTextMessage( "KVP_TYPE_ = %d", ObjectKvps[i]-&gt;vptype );
              break;
          }
      }</code></pre>

<p>I agree, but when I was writing this, I couldn't think of anything either.</p>

<p>my fear, is this will get users asking for the current presets to be a snapshot (as your PM is) , which we have had already, but I think thats wrong (its been discussed many times here already) , as the current system whilst perhaps not perfect/familar is very useful.</p>

<p>perhaps snapshot manager? is it Reaktor that calls these things snapshots?</p>

<p>yes it does that, as it stores all parameters. <br>(Ok, Ive seen a couple of objects that do not appear to be registering the the parameters properly... I can't remember which)</p>

<p>again the above table has a name, which makes it less fragile... and I believe this name has to be unique, though its worth checking this.  if you look at my Push code, from memory i display it, with the parameter name and the object name its within (IIRC) ... so hopefully forming a FQN.</p>

<p>However... I will repeat, this does all need improving... but making it so its backwards compatible, and adding the extra meta data is no small task (also has to be kept small, as its part of the runtime)<br>... there is also another possibility, which is to keep this metadata separate, but along side (an in step with) the patch binary... such that the axoloti core doesn't have to load it, but its available for other processes to decode , think, like debug symbols.  this might be better, since potentially there is alot of useful meta data, that only editors/controllers need and that for runtime axoloti does not need.<br>(axoloti runtime, could deal merely with a single index, doesnt care about the rest) </p>

<p>as I said, I suspect when Axoloti Control is being finalised, it will also require this area to be improved, as it will face the same issues when wanting to display data to the end user in a logical fashion.</p>

<p>Ah yes... that's an area open to confusion. These 'presets' are not the same as the original Axoloti presets (please add me to the ranks who gets confused by that - I'm used to the conventional meaning of 'preset' in synths). And since the original Axoloti presets aren't parameters as such, they don't get saved. PExch is fully populated AFAICS, and tests confirm this.</p>

<p>So, this thing should probably have another name, but what should that be? For what it's worth I think 99% of users will expects 'presets' to be a total store/recall of all parameters. So we have patches (which in fixed architecture synths are also called presets), original Axoloti presets, and my attempt at 'conventional' presets.</p>

<p><aside class="quote"><blockquote><p>also... and this may not matter... Id assume PExch changes as your patch changes... so does any patch change invalidate the preset stored?</p></blockquote></aside></p>

<p>I assume the above explanation, makes this half redundant, but: Changing the parameters is fine, that's what the preset manager is meant to capture. Adding/removing/changing modules in a patch will invalidate the presets previously stored for that patch. Changing the placement of modules reorders PExch, so that should be avoided too - I strongly suggest that Axoloti implements an iteration order based on the topology of the patch, not the placement of graphical placements  (you can have an algorithm from me if you wish). Therefore this PM module is best used for finalized patches, but even so I use it for patches I'm working on just to switch parameter sets (aka recall presets...) during testing. It sure beats having no conventional preset storage at all.</p>

<p><aside class="quote"><blockquote><p>...the global object parameter table (ObjectKvpRoot)</p></blockquote></aside></p>

<p>OK - that's something I will look into. If this can help me read and write all parameter values in all sub patches, I'll use that. Otherwise, just an array of pointers to the root structures of each patch would allow total store/recall of all patch parameters.</p>

<p>The issue with presets getting invalidated by patch structure changes could be avoided by having access to patch/module/parameter metadata, such that named parameters could be stored for named modules in a named (sub)patch. That metadata would eat RAM though - best placed in the SDRAM rater that the SRAM then.</p>

<p>In any case, I believe that (conventional) preset save/load is a very important feature that users will expect, so let's find a reasonable implementation and just do it!  <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley.png?v=0" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/users/drjustice">@DrJustice</a>  just been taking a look at your preset manager (only code, not played with it yet  ) </p>

<p>for discussion purposes i.e. its not criticism, its just great to have someone playing in this area, so can discuss these things. ... also I'm interested if my understanding is correct <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>I notice your using PExch, Im assuming this is fully populated on the patch (I've not checked, but explains how your PM works) <br>as such, I think this is not really saving presets, but saving a full set of current parameters values. presets are stored value in 'p' (i know not best name!)   and are a subset of the parameters. so 'theoretically' it should only save those, and also I think it should populate 'p', since otherwise if a user does a recall of a preset later, they will not pick up the values that they earlier loaded.<br>I raised, this as potentially, there is going to be confusion, between the interplay of presetmanger and recall/storing of presets  ... and frankly, I think presets already confuse many (including me <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ) </p>

<p>also... and this may not matter... Id assume PExch changes as your patch changes...  so does any patch change invalidate the preset stored?</p>

<p>of course my understanding may be incorrect, as I took a different approach on Push (as I wasn't storing the data), I used the global object parameter table (ObjectKvpRoot) ,  and just presented this to the user.<br>however, this also has 'issues' as its only the underlying parameters, so it doesn't have any knowledge of a parameter being on a 'subpatch', no issue for storage, but means from a UI perspective, you cannot show parameters that have been 'placed on the parent'<br>of course, the advantage for display, was also it has details about max/min , which aren't in PExch... unfortunately I dont think there is a relationship between PExch and the main object table (as far as i remember when playing with this) </p>

<p>here kind of illustrates where the two worlds divide:</p>

<pre><code> parent-&gt;PExch[PARAM_INDEX_square__3_pitch].pfunction = pfun_signed_clamp;
 SetKVP_IPVP(&amp;KVP_instancesquare__3_pitch,ObjectKvpRoot, "square_3" ,&amp;parent-&gt;PExch[PARAM_INDEX_square__3_pitch], -1&lt;&lt;27, 1&lt;&lt;27);
 KVP_RegisterObject(&amp;KVP_instancesquare__3_pitch);</code></pre>

<p>thats this shows, is the global table knows about the parameters and all its attributes but only knows at PExch instance, it has no knowledge of where it comes from e.g. parent/Pexch idx , similarly parent-&gt;pExch has no understanding of the actually parameter that is created in the global parameter table.</p>

<p>anyway, this is a bit fyi and discussion only... alot of this matter only when building controllers which want to expose the parameters in a sensible way to the user. but I think some of it is 'interesting' to storing patch state.</p>

<p>note: the global parameter table has the object name, which is what I kind of referred to above, this name only changes if the user changes object names, rather than patch structure.<br>I fear PExch and the index in ObjectKvpRoot are both based on the order things are built in a patch, which in turn is position on the patch canvas vs other objects. (though Ive not verified this) </p>

<p>anyway, perhaps this should be a separate topic, but i thought Id start here... as may not interest you at all <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>It depends on a structure in the firmware, which could theoretically change and break at some version, but I think that bit is fairly stable for now. And <em>if/when</em> it changes [1] it might be to the advantage of the preset manager, which I plan to keep up to date.</p>

<p>If xpatch.cpp had an array of pointers to all the patch root structures, a full global store/recall would be possible. Could this be added? Or perhaps they can be gotten to from a module already, and I'm just missing it?</p>

<p>the data could be stored in a binary blob, along with the patch version... this would allow for quick loading (no parsing) when the patch is the correct version.

              <p>I think SDCard is the best medium for storing complete patch parameter snapshots. <br>There are 2 approaches: </p>

<ul>
<li>simply writing/loading the "PExch" table to a file. This would save all parameters in the current patch, including on-parent parameters of subpatches (but excluding not-on-parent parameters of subpatches), in a binary format. It will only load well if the patch is exactly the same. Basically fairly easy to implement, but lacks preset-edit-ability from the GUI, and migrating such files when making changes to a patch. </li>
<li>writing parameter + value lists to a file, perhaps even in a human-readable text format. I think this is what <a class="mention" href="/users/thetechnobear">@thetechnobear</a> has in mind. More robust towards patch changes, but still need to be careful with unexpected behavior when loading an older preset into a changed patch. This approach has less chance to work without interrupting the audio computation, since it involves a lot of string parsing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both approaches touch an open area in the Axoloti framework. Currently the editor can only write a compiled patch to sdcard, but not open or connect to a patch running from sdcard, and keeping other data on the card (like parameter snapshots) in sync with the editor. The axoloti usb protocol allows uploading a file to sdcard but not downloading from sdcard yet.</p>

<p>My main focus atm is trying to implement midi cc into the ctrl/i object. I tried once but with wrong program editing the javacode for that object. I think I got right program now so Ill try and edit the java code again and see if I have any luck. </p>

<p>Presets are a bit down on my list, since I dont really use it as stand alone a lot yet. When I have more patches finished the presets would become more important <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

              <p>Guys, I'm not saying its not important... just the only 'paid' axoloti resource is Johannes... so there are lots of goals.<br>...currently there are 92 posts in the improvements for the patcher UI alone, and many more posts around asking for improvements/more performance etc.   </p>

<p>anyway, as I said its 'quite easy' to build this yourself if you are a programmer....<br>you will see in my Axoloti with Ableton Push video, I directly access and change the parameters completely standalone. this is done by accessing ObjectKvps in ui.c ... so that could be persisted using the fatfs libs to the SDCard.<br>(Im not sure we can write to the flash easily, Id have to check that, but I think personally id prefer SDCard)</p>

<p>the 'issue' with this, and why I have not pursued it (apart from also being busy) is some objects are not being stored there correctly, and also the current structure is (imo) too limiting. (it needs to be hierarchical, and have a bit more metadata) ... for me this is a prerequisite to any work in this area (including saving/loading) ,  the parameter code needs a bit of an overhaul which might invalid other work.<br>I've discussed this a bit with Johannes, but not enough to be able to just do it... as its pretty fundamental and could potentially break things, and i cannot put in my own private fork, as this would immediately be broken by other work that may be done in this area.</p>

<p>anyway, perhaps the show of interest, may mean johannes  will turn his attention to this area.</p>

              <p>You can save values to SD card using tables. There are examples of how to do that, but with random numbers. I made a patch, with help form community that creates a bunch of random numbers created with a random object and then saved in a table. This can be recalled over and over again and it works. But I am ot sure how to use it for preset system. Cant figure out how to send the different table values to the different parameters. The random table object is only made for controlling ONE parameter, but with many values. It should work opposite, like many parameters with only ONE value for each(Or actually as many values as you want presets).</p>

              <p>Yes , i think  store a Preset in a standalone version is a 'must' , equal what you build . It must be easy possible to save  and load  presets .<br> This are only the values of the knops  than must save and load to SD card .  Is it so hard to build a Module for this ??<br> But all in all , i am very happy with AXOLOTI.<br> Specially for me i like to have  the 12 Bit  input ADC'S in audio frequency and also the PWM's  with more than 100HZ .<br> 10..40 KHz  . Than it was usefull to control other electronics  outside from AXILOTI in realtime.<br> Hopefully it comes in an update .<br>Greets<br> Andre'</p>

<p>Yes. The current preset system is too complicated and too hard to set up. And if you want to control a lot of parameters and objects there might be some issues with the SDram, especially on larger patches. Large patches cannot really use the presets system very well. </p>

<p>Yes that would be so awesome. Nord g2 have an awesome preset/snapshot system. And I think Axolotis is inspired from G2 preset system. But in G2 you dont have to set a value for each parameters manually in a seperated system like Axoloti. This is what makes Axolotis preset system a bit complicated. On G2 you just push preset 1 adjust parameters as you like, push preset 2 make the sound as you like and so on. It is way simpler and could be used in "Live" mode too <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>BTW the parameter table must be big, because my Synth has about 107 Parameters to store. <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/sunglasses.png?v=0" title=":sunglasses:" class="emoji" alt=":sunglasses:"></p>

But i can't store  the Presets   in the standalone mode ?!!<br>We have now a tool that allows us to develope  nice synths and effects - but without saving - or - only save the presets on a PC/MAC. The goal should be to get a standalone APP that allows  also to store the presets. <br>Hopefully this will be fixed in future .<br>Best was a preset manager  that is controlled by MIDI so that i can switch the Presets  via MIDI <br>Without saving patches   it is a little...... disappointing.<br>But Ok ,   AXALOTI  is a brand new   System.
