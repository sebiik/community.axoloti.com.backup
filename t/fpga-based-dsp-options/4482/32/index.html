        <p>With a FPGA you need digital <strong>electronics</strong> skills along with programming skills (to program cores) and DSP skills (to design audio algorithms).</p>

<p>As you state, the main interest is that even if some embedded cores have a sequential internal behaviour, the main interest and <strong>difficulty</strong> is that everything in a FPGA runs in parallel. You have to deal with synchronisations and build yourself such things as pipelines...</p>

<p>About FPAA... you cannot miniaturize capacitors in the range we use in the audio (nF uF). These are condemn to be external components. FPAA will be of limited use. So, don't expect a one chip Prophet V. </p>

<p>I think that the right way (low cost, efficient way, easily programmable) is an array of ARM processors.</p>

<p>But i don't think that <a class="mention" href="/u/johannes">@johannes</a> plans to make Axolotis SPI-communicate-and-synchronize (which is complex and difficult for a "one man army") any time soon <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/disappointed.png?v=5" title=":disappointed:" class="emoji" alt=":disappointed:"> .</p>

<p>How would it work in Scanalog though, surely the miniaturisation is no obstacle due to the ability to interconnect the built-in components.  Wouldn't any such limits be overcome by simply programming the connections between resistors, capacitors etc, in series or parallel configuration depending on how much capacitance or resistance is required?</p>

<p>In analogue, you increase or decrease resistance or capacitance through their arrangement.  Don't forget they're working with ready-made component blocks, so that probably means that if the capacitance or resistance you wanted is not physically possible with a single component, it would silently connect two or more in the required configuration in order to achieve the same task.</p>

<p>I'm hoping it must work something like that, otherwise that Scanalog project would not be much use at all.</p>

        <p>It seams from some documentation, the built in components are somewhat part of an attempt to mimic the real life components, not sure if all FPAA devices are the exact same, but one document describes use of a transistor, a single generic capacitor, and op-amp to achieve the required outcome, so would expect it could contain many multiples of this group within the FPAA itself. It doesn't state it as an accurate result, but a close enough result in terms of how it operates. Documentation also highlights very high dependancy on software like "Scanalog" to make good use of all this.</p>

        <p>The Anadigm FPAAs use switched capacitor technology. E.g. a switched capacitor filter uses the ratio of smaller capacitors (on the chip), so no large (external) capacitors are needed, at least for that. It's worth noting that with switched capacitor circuits, the sampling theorem applies and anti-aliasing filters must be applied accordingly. To this end the Anadigm chips have programmable 2nd order anti-aliasing/reconstruction filters on board.</p>

<blockquote><p>What is the switching frequency of the switched capacitors ?</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>I think it's max 4 MHz for the AN231E04 (the chip variant used in the Paradigm synth).</p>

<p>BTW, the AN2xxxxx family is called not FPAA, but dpASPs (dynamically programmed Analog Signal Processors), since they can be (re)configured at any time, not just on start up.</p>

        <p>So as it has been at least 6 months since I have thought about seeing if I would be interested in learning FPGA, I decided to use your links to see if it would change anything, the video is good, but boy does he talk a lot...</p>

<p>Anyhow, unfortunately the outcome is the same, when I look into what is involved with simulating signal paths and problem solving, added with the fact that a lot of coding can be done much simpler with a microcontroller, it does create an overwhelming sensation of a very steep learning curve, and as before becomes something maybe for a later date.</p>

<p>One example I looked at was a 4 in 1 out mux, for a beginner I guess the code would appear quite complex, but over time I could get familiar with it, but then when I saw the simulation and tried to compare it to the code, I thought WTF !, I just could match it up, I think due to it appearing to be very complex, and I may have just talked myself out if it, but still, not for me.</p>

        <p>This thread reminded me of an excellent project for those interested in the basics of logic design and low-level programming: <a href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.nand2tetris.org/</a></p>

<p>The project has a corresponding book: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686/ref=ed_oe_p" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686/ref=ed_oe_p</a></p>

<p>It basically walks you up the stack building up a basic computer architecture at the gate level, assembler and high-level language all from first principles. The toolchain is all custom to the project, but the concepts are very general. At the end you have a full computing system stack all emulated in software that you can write games for, somewhat like a Gameboy.</p>

<p>The DREAM company offers a range of multi DSP chips optimised for audio applications.<br>See for example : <a href="https://www.dream.fr/pdf/Serie5000/SAM_Datasheets/SAM5708B.pdf">https://www.dream.fr/pdf/Serie5000/SAM_Datasheets/SAM5708B.pdf</a></p>

<p>The problem, as already stated, is to make them easily programmable so that a graphic editor can be used to design synths.</p>

<p>As usual with this stuff, looking into one product leads to another, and another, and another.  And yesterday I stumbled upon what is probably <em>the</em> most important development of all (for me anyway).  It's a board (PyBoard) that runs the Python programming language (MicroPython), and does so "Bare-Metal", so it's incredibly fast.  In other words, the MicroPython language is its bare-metal operating system, meaning you can start programming, or have it run, MicroPython with <em><strong>bare-metal</strong></em> performance the moment you switch it on.  To give you an idea of just how easy it is to work with, check this page out:</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/pyboard/pyboard/general.html" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/pyboard/pyboard/general.html</a></p>

<p>Love it, and I think I'd be better-off concentrating on learning that than learning the FPGA thing, cause I'd also be learning Python.  I should point-out though that I don't really want it for DSP, I want it mainly for controlling logic of products, and I honestly cannot see a limitation of a board such as this in being able to deliver.  It being bare-metal, you can do DSP on it if you wish (it's incredibly fast), but like I said, that's not what I want it for, I would much rather use Axoloti for working with DSP.</p>

<p>Anyway, it's a <em>very</em> different thing, I know that, but I think I'll go for this instead of an FPGA board, might even pick-up the book as well cause that'll help learning Python as well as the board:</p>

        <p>Micropython has been extended to several other development boards like some arduino boards etc.. and is continuing to do so for others.

        <p>Just out of curiosity... why do you choose a dev board programmed in MicroPython which is relatively new, over a dev board programmed in C like the arduino which has many years of available free resources which has many concepts that transfer over to how you program the modules in the Axo patcher... ?? <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/thinking.png?v=5" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:"></p>

        <p><a class="mention" href="/u/gavin">@Gavin</a>  I was reading about that, being able to use it on Arduino etc, but I don't see the point when the board shown above is the official one that was designed from the ground-up to run it.  The hardware is Open Source hardware, just like the software is open source, so buying the official board to learn on just makes perfect sense to me.  If I were to start making successfull use of it in various products, I'd be able to take whatever components I need and just incorporate them into my own designs, so it's not as if the price of the official board will have any bearing on that.</p>

<p>Basically, I see the purchase of the official board as a sensible one-off move so I have the comfort of knowing that any problems I come-up against while learning it, are down to me, and not some hardware-based problem.  Not only that, I like to support the people who brought the project to life, so even if I only ever buy that one official board, I've supported their time and effort in bringing the platform to us.</p>

<p>Regards the C/Python thing, I hear you, but I've been looking into various languages and trying a little of each, reading/watching opinions etc, and I really like Python cause it feels more human-readable and like there is less work to do in order to do the same thing, so less chance of errors and easier to learn.  I'm not saying it is easier to learn or that it is less prone to errors, but it looks/feels that way to me.</p>

<p>What's cool about MicroPython is that you're programming a language that's easy to digest, and is getting run "bare-metal" on a piece of hardware that is so simple even a beginner could roll their own hardware with just a few components and a hot-air solder station!</p>

<p>So it's easy to build, easy to program, and very fast (cause unlike standard Python, it runs bare-metal).  Also, unlike on a Raspberry Pi, there's no OS to get in the way and/or slow things down or complicate things.  You just switch it on, and you have <strong><em>bare-metal</em></strong> Python <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>

<p>There's nothing other than a persons own programming skills stopping them from developing their very own standalone computer with custom designed video and sound drivers etc.  Just switch it on and off you go, bare-metal performance would come of your MicroPython programming skills!</p>

<p>Getting carried away there, but the point I'm making is it's true, you <em>can</em> do that.  All of that said, for all I know, I could get into it and suddenly decide, nah, I'd rather learn C or whatever <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/grin.png?v=5" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>

        <p>I guess the downside of a Python-based solution would be when it comes to trying to integrate with external hardware (which is likely to happen pretty quickly), you’ll likely have to write your own drivers etc. from scratch.</p>

<p>That’s could be viewed as a ‘plus’ for some, but is definitely a ‘minus’ for most, I imagine.</p>

        <p>I know, but that's the kinda stuff I want to learn it for, drivers etc (that's why the FPGA thing grabbed my attention).  I'm wanting to get as close to bare-metal as possible so that I can write my own LCD drivers etc.  I want to be able to design these things and reuse them across multiple products.  Learning this stuff also cuts product costs considerably, cause driving for example an LCD and everything else from a single board or chip, removes the need for having to purchase dedicated driver boards which ultimately, would not perform as good as a custom bare-metal driver would.</p>

<p>If I'm going to learn this stuff, it might as well be stuff that is geared towards what I need in the long run.</p>
