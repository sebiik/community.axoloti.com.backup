    <title>Multi midi source sampler control</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/multi-midi-source-sampler-control/5650</link>
    <description>Hi
I&#39;m working on my polyphonic 8 voice sampler patch using different midi source.
basically the patch gets midi from USB and din.
DIN midi is used to play notes and get clock signal. The USB for control of parameters.
I&#39;m using an arpeggiator, clocked by the DIN signal and with its parameter controlled via the USB host.
I&#39;m having a problem switching between normal playback and arpeggiated playback.
I could managed it on one version of the patch but then I get all voice playing at the same time when arpeggiated, then being louder then normal playback and distorted.
On the other version (v14) I seem to get some kind of midi feedback loop, if I get things right I would need to be able to declare midi device as omni on the main patch then transfer part of it to an internal port and then declare the voice subpatch as only controlled by internal. Unfortunately I could not find a way to do this.

I already posted about this here:
http://community.axoloti.com/t/arpeggiator-playing-louder/5380/9

I have another problem related to the clocking of the arpeggiator from the midi DIN in. I made clock division to get it to be on the 32th to 2nd division. Problem is that It slowly drifts from the clock and I have to start stop the midi clock (a midipal) to get it to be in sync with the other machines.
Is there any way to fix that? or maybe another way to do it that would not induce this drifting.

here are the two patches

<p>on the precedent version K11work, I was using counter to divide the clock signal coming from the DRJ object clock _rx. I was trying to reset counters each bar, and I also try to reset those when loading a new sample via program change. It sent that any CPU drain would drift the clock sync.</p>

<p>In the new version I used the divremc objet for the clock division and the basic midi/in/clock for the clock source, as it is just for an arpeggio I don't really need start, stop and other option.<br>It seems to be stable this way.</p>

<p>I still need to find a way for the other issue, I used volume control to put down the level when on arpeggiated mode, but still it does saturate a bit the sound.</p>
