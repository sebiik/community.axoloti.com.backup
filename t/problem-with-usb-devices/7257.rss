    <title>Problem with USB Devices</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/problem-with-usb-devices/7257</link>
    <description>One of my Axoloti Devices just became glitchy with USB Keyboards. Normally I used a LPD8 for it but some days ago the LPD stoped working at all after I used it with my Axoloti. Now I wanted to map another USB Devices and I realize that there seems to be a problem with the Axoloti receiving the midi data. Someone knows what it could be? I did not change anything inside, just had it at home for some time cause I was painting the enclosure. After that this problem showed up. Can it also be that the LPD got destroyed by the Axo in some way?

the pots to the analog in are working as usual...</description>

              <p>I also assume that it is a power issue. Just realize that both boards that I have act glitchy when I power them with USB Power from a laptop and have the patcher open. I just thought it is just one of those after my LPD got fried and as I tested another keyboard these glichtes appear. That happen some time after I program the Axoloti in the way that it lights up the buttons of the LPD. DonÂ´t know if that fried it after a while? Also I have two external LEDs connected to the Axo. But yes the other one is also glitchy when I test it with USB Power from a Laptop. But maybe it is in general a good Idea to go away from USB Power with an adapter?</p>

              <p>I use a few different usb midi devices, and don't often have connection problems (sounds like yours is losing connection after a while?).</p>

<p>My first thought is how are you powering the axo? And what are you trying to connect now? Could it be using more power?</p>

<p> I have some weird issues sometimes that I think are power related. Like, I use the dc socket for power, launchpad pro connected, patch running fine. If I plug in usb I think my crappy laptop does something funny and the launchpad crashes. Seems to happen when I have lots of leds lit up. A restart sorts it, and it doesn't happen often. Probably totally unrelated to your problem!</p>

<p>Did you spill paint in the axo? <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/grinning.png?v=5" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:"></p>

              <p>Anyone has an Idea how I can solve it? Just testet it again. I made a patch with just the midi display object. When I connect a USB Keyboard it first works as expected and after a while it just stops receiving any data...</p>
