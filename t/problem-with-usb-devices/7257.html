        <p>One of my Axoloti Devices just became glitchy with USB Keyboards. Normally I used a LPD8 for it but some days ago the LPD stoped working at all after I used it with my Axoloti. Now I wanted to map another USB Devices and I realize that there seems to be a problem with the Axoloti receiving the midi data. Someone knows what it could be? I did not change anything inside, just had it at home for some time cause I was painting the enclosure. After that this problem showed up. Can it also be that the LPD got destroyed by the Axo in some way?</p>

<p>the pots to the analog in are working as usual...</p>

        <p>Anyone has an Idea how I can solve it? Just testet it again. I made a patch with just the midi display object. When I connect a USB Keyboard it first works as expected and after a while it just stops receiving any data...</p>

        <p>I use a few different usb midi devices, and don't often have connection problems (sounds like yours is losing connection after a while?).</p>

<p>My first thought is how are you powering the axo? And what are you trying to connect now? Could it be using more power?</p>

<p> I have some weird issues sometimes that I think are power related. Like, I use the dc socket for power, launchpad pro connected, patch running fine. If I plug in usb I think my crappy laptop does something funny and the launchpad crashes. Seems to happen when I have lots of leds lit up. A restart sorts it, and it doesn't happen often. Probably totally unrelated to your problem!</p>

<p>Did you spill paint in the axo? <img src="https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/images/emoji/twitter/grinning.png?v=5" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:"></p>

        <p>I also assume that it is a power issue. Just realize that both boards that I have act glitchy when I power them with USB Power from a laptop and have the patcher open. I just thought it is just one of those after my LPD got fried and as I tested another keyboard these glichtes appear. That happen some time after I program the Axoloti in the way that it lights up the buttons of the LPD. Don´t know if that fried it after a while? Also I have two external LEDs connected to the Axo. But yes the other one is also glitchy when I test it with USB Power from a Laptop. But maybe it is in general a good Idea to go away from USB Power with an adapter?</p>
