<p>Secondly, and more importantly, is it in anyway possible to receive the mouse X/Y data as X/Y positions instead of velocity?<br>I opened up the help file, but it seems this is just a secondary operation to carry out on the velocity instead of setting it to get absolute X/Y position in the first place.. as I guess the converter will send mouse X/Y positions..</p>

        <p>fixed it.. not the way it should, but at least it's working..<br>hint: don't try to put the 12 bits into a 16 bit variable directly.<br>Make a second X and Y (next to the x and y variable, I just used upper case) to get MSB and LSB independently into x/y and X/Y (usb_hid_mouse) and add them together in the usbconf.h.

        <p>i find it a little irritating that you delete all your posts before the "final" answer, why is that? also, maybe you could share your code snippets of the changed files rather than giving hints. i am personally not trying to replicate this, but who knows, maybe someone wants to and you could spare him all the trouble you went through (sorry i could not help out there, btw.) that aside, great effort and glad to hear you got it working!!</p>

        <p>why so bitter?</p>

<p>this was a post/problem related to a firmware change. most of the people on the forum here (except for maybe 2 or 3)  have never even touched the firmware (or don't have the capability to compile it). this of course does not mean they have not read your post. i imagine <a class="mention" href="../../u/johannes.html">@johannes</a> or <a class="mention" href="../../u/thetechnobear.html">@thetechnobear</a> could have helped you out, but anyone else? i am not so sure about that. what if <a class="mention" href="../../u/thetechnobear.html">@thetechnobear</a> was on holiday for example, computer off time? you cannot take answers/help for granted with advanced stuff like this, especially since this is an open source software thing, and apart from <a class="mention" href="../../u/johannes.html">@johannes</a> nobody gets any money from it.</p>

        <p>I'm reacting bitter as no one even tried to help or even support to raise awareness for this question for 6 days but do have the balls to ask for the anwser a soon as there is one. I'm a noob with coding myself, so even though it's a hard one for everyone here, any help or support might have been really welcome. Just the fact that people would take notice and write down some good intended advice would have taken away the feeling that I was being completely ignored, which just made things worse as I'm quite susceptible to that and it screws up my head. Forcing me to not only solve the problem, but also having to fight my own head as every negative thing gets highlighted to the max..</p>

        <p>you see, it is quite the inverse for me. it screws with my head if people write things that don't belong in a post (because they don't know the answer) only because they think they have to write something down. so rather then writing an answer i knew would not help you, i stayed quiet, but still read the post.</p>

<p>not knowing the inside of your head, how should anyone here know that you take that personally/that it messes with your head?</p>

<p>and as also stated before, i don't need the answer, i just find it a bit ironic that you ask for help in a forum, and once you don't get any (for reasons we don't know, but i gave some suggestions) and find the answer yourself, you are not willing to share it. but ok, it is your work, so your choice as well.</p>

        <p>I think we all have asked questions in here that never got answered. I have many of them...... Which is at times annoying, but there could be many reason, maybe people dont know how to fix it or maybe those who knows how to fix them simply haven't seen them.</p>

<p>I would feel stupid just writing something that doesn't make sense. That would probably be even more annoying when trying to troubleshoot something.</p>

<p>Some things just takes longer time figuring out.</p>

<p>Anyway, stil happy that you sorted it out, so you can get on with the project <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

        <p>Hey Remco, could it be true, the mighty-module-making-machine otherwise known as the SickSik, has gone and lost his cool?</p>

<p>Nah, I totally understand your frustration, and I was hoping someone would help you out.  I think it's true though, that probably only Johannes and Mark would be able to help with firmware stuff, and I have a feeling that maybe both of them are at NAMM 2019, hopefully showing-off that new axoloti control thing.</p>

<p>Anyway, just wanted to cheer you up, just be glad you're not me <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/grinae52.png?v=5" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>
