    <description>Hello, sorry if this is a stupid question. How can I convert a binary file on the sd card back to .axp?

Axoloti froze up while saving and the file it saved is 0kb. I&#39;m trying to get the old version back.</description>

              <p>I've had problems where it doesn't save properly and there's some java related errors showing. It seems to happen if I've been using the patcher for a while and have copy/pasted a lot of objects or have moved a lot of objects at once or rearranged a lot of things. I notice the patcher slowing down, save and it doesn't save properly. It doesn't happen often, just every now and then.</p>

<p>I always 'save as' with a new name when saving now, and do it regularly, so at least I don't lose too much.</p>

              <p>Ugh this time nothing even happened but trying to open my AXP this morning i got all kind of java XML parsing errors and it wouldn't load the project. Upon inspecting the AXP file it looks like the XML code just got truncated at around 80-90% of the object.</p>

<p>i guess no hope here either, 2 weeks of work gone? looks like i need to put my axoloti folder in the dropbox after all...</p>

<p>edit. i still have the functional BUILD folder from the proper project, but i guess no easy way to reverse to AXP from the CPP file huh?</p>

<p>edit2. i just somewhat randomly glued together the broken file with the end of the last (2 weeks old) version AXP, going after what seemed like a good "cut point" determined by an identifiable unique line in the code that i saw towards the end of both versions. axo now loads the project with just 4-5 unresolvable objects. the patcher GUI is somewhere between both version as expected, with a bunch of obejcts and connections missing. i will try and fix it from here but i am worried there might be a lot of dead useless half hidden ojects and abandoned trash code now which will mess with the performance... </p>

<p>guys, make regular backups. like at least daily...</p>

              <p>It was starting to freeze up and be unresponsive so I hit save so I wouldn't lose 20-30 min of work. But the file was corrupt and I saved over the previous version so I lost the whole patch. </p>

<p>Luckily, most not all of the modules were sub patches and objects from other patches. Still, it seems like a decompiler would be useful, not just for situations like this, but for example if you wanted to work on a patch on tour on someone elses laptop or if you hard drive crashed or if you just didn't have your computer with you and needed to do some editing</p>

              <p>matter of fact i lost 2-3h work yesterday too when axo somehow didn't save my project. i think thhis might have happened when i restarted my macbook and the editor just closed instead of asking to save unsaved changes.</p>

<p>either way i guess i'm out of luck here too..</p>
