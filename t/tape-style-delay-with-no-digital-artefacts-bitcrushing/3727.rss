    <title>Tape Style Delay with no Digital Artefacts / Bitcrushing</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/tape-style-delay-with-no-digital-artefacts-bitcrushing/3727</link>
    <description>Hey there,

I tried a lot of objects from the community library, for example the &quot;tape delay&quot; by @TheSlowGrowth and the syncable delay by @DrJustice and even looper blocks by @rbrt that I use like a delay  to get this pitch chaning effect when twisting the speed of delay. Like on tape, bucket brigade and vintage digital delays. Problem is I always get this bit crusing like noise when I twist the speed. I guess this propably due to bad interpolation or something.

here and example:https://soundcloud.com/blindsmyth/axo-bitcrushing-delay/s-Fr16w

Although it sounds quite cool the bitcrushing thing is kind of overwhelming.

Is there any solution out here that is more true to that classic delay time twisting sound? I mean this effect has been realized a douzen of times in dsp environment, so I&#39;m quite surprised to still not having something like that in axoloti...

P.S. I remember having quite good results with &quot;triggered buffer&quot; by @cpwitz, but I could&#39;t clock sync that one and can&#39;t afford a 32bit table.</description>

              <p>Really nice! <br>I remember using your synced  reader a while a go but had to switch to that table solution because of ram space.</p>

<p>If you put the filter in the feedback path together with a hp and saturation you get totally tapeish sounds <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I want to work on my multiple axoloti setup where I can use one board only for fx, with you filter trick I'm definately happy to use the delay in that setup.</p>

<p>Ok that is good to know. I'm not a coder but I looked into the table and delay objects and found they are both referencing to an array so good to hear that there is hope <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>This is pretty hard because table/alloc only allows me double the table size values. So I could half the table's size but that one mean half the looping time per slot wich is not an option because I would end up with 10s looping time per slot, wich is too short for certain musical phrases.<br>The possibilty to save the recorded loops to sd card in realtime in order to free sdram would propably save me in that case <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>OK, here's a version with tap tempo and relative smoothed time control.</p>

<p>Note that you have to tap to get it started since the initial delay time is 0. The relative time control uses the proportional time modulation input for a range that corresponds to the delay line length.</p>

<p>Note that these patches use the factory 1 pole LPF for the smoothing - one might want one that goes lower in frequency than 8Hz for even more smoothing at the cost of the fastest rate that the delay time can be changed.</p>

<p>It may be possible to make a writer that uses a portion of a referenced table, but that is a rather specialized functionality (which may require a matching reader), and I think that other means of making room should be tried first.</p>

<p>Edit: added tape flutter to the delay just to keep myself entertained...</p>

              <p>This sounds pretty dope and is pretty much what I'm looking for, thx!! The pitch change sound is somehow digital but in a nice way that's definately really expressive but not too prominent.</p>

<p>Now i've now only two things missing<br>1.Could you add a tap tempo/clock to this and still have the knob changing dlytime/pitch relative to tap/clock?<br>2. All my sdram is taken by a big table for looping but infact I only use 3/4 of this table for looping. The last 1/4 is theoretically free for delay.<br>Woul there be a way to built this either with tables or would it be possible to change dly read and write so that they use part of that table?</p>

<p>Right now I'm using this (based on <a class="mention" href="/u/rbrt">@rbrt</a>'s blocks)<br>Using the Lp filter before delay/read doesn't really work unfortunately.<br><a class="attachment" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/3/33b2aa013d3a147e661769247ab32b5bd69b562f.axp">table delay.axp</a> (12.4 KB)</p>

              <p>By smoothing the time change sufficiently one can get rid of the sharp discontinuities, which gives tape-delay'ish pitch sweeps.</p>

<p>The attached example patch demonstrates this. On the left there's a bread and butter delay patches together, with a 1 pole LPF to smooth the changes. Wiggle the delay time dial to test (not the time knob on the reader module).</p>
