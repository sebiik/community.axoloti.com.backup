    <title>Axoloti for loud, guitar-centered noise rock</title>

    <description>Hiya all,

I feel bad that I have not given updates or useful input to the community for a while so here&#39;s a gratuitous update on Axoloti as I am using it in a noise-rock and guitar-focused context.

I use Axoloti mostly for guitar effects but I started building songs around Axoloti-based percussion sequences and the ability to synchronize percussion and modulation of my guitar effects.  This kind of control is unique and amazing - I&#39;m able to do things like synchronize beat sequences to automatic sweeps of my guitar effect &quot;knobs.&quot;  I love how this makes it hard for a listener to tell exactly what instrument is making what noise, and how they are all changing.  Also I really love throwing random number generators in to a rock context where usually you don&#39;t have that kind of generative thing going on.

For some setup details, I have two Axolotis, and I use stereo Y cables so that I can use each Axo as a dual audio source/processor.  My primary Axoloti receives MIDI inputs from a Behringer FCB1010 foot pedal for selecting patches and controlling sounds in each patch.  My primary guitar signal goes through this and is processed with a range of sounds (special thanks to to @cpwitz, @Sputnki, @valmir... I&#39;m using your objects, patches, ideas extensively for making music - thank you!).  Often those sounds are modulated/changed in sync with percussion/glitch sounds or sample playbacks within the Axoloti patch, drawing heavily on the ported Braids code.  

Then, the 2nd Axoloti functions as a dual processor for (a) vocal effects (still working on making this happen the way I want) and (b) a 2nd dedicated feedback guitar that I play entirely with Axoloti and foot pedals... routing the guitar through a bitcrusher effect and filters, I change filter parameters based on MIDI triggers from my percussion, so that I get a guitar-based percussive noise background for songs.  It is a really strange sound unlike anything I&#39;ve ever heard before and I love it.

In a band context, this means I&#39;m playing 2 guitars (one with my hands + Axoloti and other effects, the other with my foot - a volume pedal and Axoloti effects as a percussive/background) and triggering synthesized percussion &amp; sample playback with my feet, plus singing through Axoloti.  I work with a drummer and a bass player but this Axoloti-based system makes us sound more like 5 people not 3.  

The only demo tracks we&#39;ve recorded so far do not showcase our full live setup because they lack the 2nd guitar and don&#39;t have the Axoloti voice processing, but still a lot of the songs are written around what Axoloti does, and if you&#39;re an Axoloti user probably that is obvious.  Listen here:  https://loams.bandcamp.com/releases

And here&#39;s a photo of my home-made pedalboard in use.  The box decorated in nail-polish (painted by my kid) houses my two Axolotis.  I also use a homemade switch box so that I can bypass Axoloti and use my fuzz pedal on its own sometimes.

If anybody wants to know specifics about any of this, let me know!</description>
