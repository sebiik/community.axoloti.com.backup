    <title>Tube Amp Modeling</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/tube-amp-modeling/5168</link>
    <description>Has anyone attempted to model a tube amplifier?  Maybe not to the extent of Line 6&#39;s models, but along those same lines?  

I&#39;m interested in doing this myself, but I am hoping I can find someone to work with me on this.  I have modeled a Fender Champ in LTSpice.  I would like to gather the required data from that on the transfer function and then model it in an Axoloti object.</description>
