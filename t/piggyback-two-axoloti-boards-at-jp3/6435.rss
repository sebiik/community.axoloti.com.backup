    <title>Piggyback two axoloti boards at JP3</title>

    <description>hello hello again,

so i had this idea. i just needed to connect another axoloti to my system and was too lazy to crimp/solder proper power connectors from my 12v supply. instead i tried just connecting a vdd and a gnd pin from the GPIO pinheaders of another axo board that is powered externally, and zoom it works (people who different from me understand electronics might have figured that already).

which brought me to another though - should i be able to just stack two axoloti boards, only power one of them, and send power/gndd and (not optocoupled) midi directly througgh some looong pinheaders in jp3 of each board? midi in/out crossed obviously.

i&#39;m not sure yet if there&#39;s any actual benefit to this. but yeah. should work, right?

whats the consumption of just an axoloti board with no GPIO or usb addons? like 80-100 mA?</description>
