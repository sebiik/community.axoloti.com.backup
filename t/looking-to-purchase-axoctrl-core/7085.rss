    <description>if anyone has one of these they don&#39;t use much, or want to get rid of, let me know

I fried my axo a bit, and can&#39;t use it for an axo ctrl, I&#39;ll probably still pick up a new core next batch

but I can&#39;t trust myself with a soldiering iron, so if anyone wants a side project let me know your price</description>
