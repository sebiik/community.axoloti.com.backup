    <title>ADSR object workings?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/adsr-object-workings/2336</link>
    <description>Hi All,
so I started looking in the .axo stuff a bit and I thought to modify the factory ADSR envelope to an ADBSR one but I have to get around to how this all works so euhm... this is already pretty much a challenge to me.

I think I understand the in/out stuff, the trigger stages of the envelope, the MTOF, USAT, SMMUL (sort of - been googling on PureData and ARM command set) but how does this envelope calculate over time? What&#39;s the best start on getting further into this?
