    <title>Unable to mount SDcard (solved)</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/unable-to-mount-sdcard-solved/6213</link>
    <description>Hej,
each time I enter card reader mode Axoloti recognized the card but lost the connection as soon as the card gets mounted from Windows meanwhile. And if I unmount the card after this no further action is possible (have to restart Axoloti for the same game). Automatic mounting is disabled in Windows. Any ideas?
