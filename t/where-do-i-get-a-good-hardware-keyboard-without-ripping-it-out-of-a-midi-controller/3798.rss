    <title>Where do I get a GOOD hardware keyboard (without ripping it out of a MIDI controller)?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/where-do-i-get-a-good-hardware-keyboard-without-ripping-it-out-of-a-midi-controller/3798</link>
    <description>I want to build a custom MIDI controller and am looking for a suitable hardware keyboard to go along with it. My requirements would be:
1) the best quality keys, semiweighted if possible.
2) a transfer protocol suitable for axoloti (MIDI, UART, whatever,...)

The easiest is obviously to just rip it out of a conventional MIDI controller. I have done precisely this before but am not satisfied, because:
1) most MIDI controllers have shitty keys, except for really expensive ones, where I dont know whether they are truely suitable, until I rip them apart
2) most MIDI controllers deliver more features than i actually need, thus they consume more power and have larger boards, etc.

Does anybody know a source for raw hardware keyboards or has thought about this issue more? If anybody can recommend MIDI controller with good keys, that are worth to be ripped apart for this purpose I am also interested.</description>

              <p>Almost everyone who doesn't have the in-house manufacturing power to make their own, buy Fatar keyboards. This means they basically have a monopoly on the keybed market. They also don't really sell to individuals but are an OEM seller to companies. This means you have to buy LARGE quantities if you want any. It is really a drag but the used keyboard market is the only route and even then you have to know the particular topology used by the keyboard (diode matrix, resistor chain, multiple contacts, busses, etc.).<br>It is great if Doepfer is re-selling the Fatar ones they buy. That is very rare.</p>

              <p>Hi, for this purpose I highly recommend <a href="http://www.doepfer.de/zubeh_e.htm#Keybeds" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.doepfer.de/zubeh_e.htm#Keybeds</a> As far as I know all high end syths (Moog, DSI,Access Virus) use Fatar keybeds. The semiweighted one is TP/9S available in 4/5 octaves. If you are not located in Europe it might be better to find a local supplier.</p>
