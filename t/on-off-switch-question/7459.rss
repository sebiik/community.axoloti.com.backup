    <title>On/Off switch question</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/on-off-switch-question/7459</link>
    <description>Sometimes it is required to reboot axoloti from my experience (for example when it doesn&#39;t recognize midi controller, doesn&#39;t load patch etc.)

To make this fast and convenient I wanna include an on/off switch to my boards.
I power externally via the dc input but usually have axoloti also hooked up to the computer via usb.
So if I want te reboot I have to break power both on dc and usb line. I wanna do this with one switch. Is it possible to break the 5V power coming from usb somewhere on the board?</description>

              <p>I did something like replacing R26 with a switch. I don't remember what I did exactly but I essentially cut into the incoming 5V from the USB and placed in the switch, take a look at the schematic. It worked well, I soldered on small wires to the tiny pads and put a drop of hot glue around them.</p>

<p>I also put in a 5V USB battery bank inline with the switch.</p>

              <p>That's a tricky one.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Power from USB goes through R26 (a ferrite), so you could desolder R26 and insert your switch there, <span class="bbcode-b">but</span> that part is rather small and difficult to reach.</p></li>
<li><p>There is actually an electronic switch already installed in the USB power line (for turning off USB power while there is external DC available), so you could manipulate its ENABLE-input to turn it off, <span class="bbcode-b">but</span> that ENABLE is low-active, so would have to provide 3.3V from somewhere while you want the Axoloti switched off.</p></li>
<li><p>You could interrupt the 5V line from the DC/MIDI-half of the Axoloti PCB to the main "half". That would sabotage the supply from the DC input, while USB power is still switched off (because the ENABLE-line is still powered from the DC input), <span class="bbcode-b">but</span> the opto-coupler for DIN MIDI reception is powered from the DC/MIDI side and would still deliver a high level to the UART input of the CPU, which could power the CPU well enough to prevent a reset. Or not, since the UART-pin must be 5V-tolerant, so the usual diode to VCC should be missing on that pinâ€¦ I don't know. Anyway, a 10k resistor before the UART input is the usual measure against parasitic supply and should be easy enough to install at the border between the two PCB parts.</p></li>
<li><p>You could also connect a reset button to the SWD port instead of cutting power to restart the Axoloti, <span class="bbcode-b">but</span> that would only restart the Axoloti and not any MIDI controller connected via USB.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, there are several (and probably more) ways, each with its own advantages and disadvatages.</p>
