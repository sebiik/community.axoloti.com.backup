    <title>Seems like this would work for CV input from modular to Axoloti</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/seems-like-this-would-work-for-cv-input-from-modular-to-axoloti/5580</link>
    <description>I got excited when I found the resources on electronics that are available online. I was looking at the SimplyElectronics channel on YouTube and he uses this brilliant circuit design and simulation app, www.everycircuit.com 

Someone has designed a circuit for stepping from CV   5v  to -5v  to Arduino voltage.  Its similar to some of the suggested circuits that have been shared here using a voltage divider and a diode, but adds an op amp for buffering.  
 
I&#39;m no hardware guy, but have always had an interest in electronics so I&#39;m going to drill into this a bit further as I like it as a hobby.  All thanks to mum and dad who bought me my first electronics kit at the age of 11. I have a bit of catching up to do.

    I'll be working on revising this post here, I was going to write it in a text document but realized it would be easier for me to get all the images if I just made it here. I was looking for a a save feature so I could wait to post until complete but could not find it. So please note this is all a work in progress and NEEDS further revision/information.

VDD is the digital 3.3V supply, use it to power external logic

VDDA is the analog refeâ€¦
