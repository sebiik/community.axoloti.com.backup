    <title>Editing each voice individually</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/editing-each-voice-individually/6720</link>
    <description>Forgive me but I&#39;m bad with proper lingo and terms but I will try my best!

If I&#39;ve created a 4 voice synth and want to change parameters of each voice (lets say I want each voice&#39;s oscillators to be tuned differently for example) how would I go about doing this? orrr is it even possible?

In theory I guess I could assign a midi controller channel to each voice and fiddle with them that way but how would I edit each individual voice to listen for input from each one of those channels?

It seems like when I make a polyphonic patch by creating an object (./subpatchname) then im stuck with just one instance of the subpatch...editing the subpatch means editing every voice...</description>

<p>it shows:<br>-how to use tables to have different parameter settings for different voices<br>-how to get the maximum voices as info for your patch (see polyphonic synth voice patch) and use it to select the right parameter from the table.<br>-randomise all voices&amp;parameters<br>-save&amp;load your voice-parameter-settings to SD-card for future recall<br>-initiate the voices (see init-text on table allocator)<br>-have just three controls to select between all available parameters and voices and set their values.<br>-get the last used poly-index and reset the order of polyindex-&gt;preset, so next voice will use preset 1.</p>

<p>in the synth-patch you could even use different audio outputs and a demux to send each voice to it's own output for different fx routings</p>

As this way allows each voice the longest time for the release stage. But I'm not sure whether this is the way it is currently done (could also be the lowest unused voice-index).</p>

<p>To use this module to select from different values for each voice, you could use a table that you can update outside of the polyphonic patch:<br>-add a table module of size 4 to your main patch<br>-add a table readout inside the polyphonic embedded patch and add the name of the table module with ../ added before the name to let it read the table outside the embedded patch: ../allocate32b<br>-use the polyindex module to select the read-index.<br>-use a table write module to fill the table with the desired values. You could also edit this module like this for direct control of each voice by adding a set of knobs and by changing the k-rate page like:<br>attr_table.array[0]=param_p1;<br>attr_table.array[1]=param_p2;<br>attr_table.array[2]=param_p3;<br>attr_table.array[3]=param_p4;</p>

    Hello :slight_smile:  

I was wondering if anyone could describe what the polyindex object exactly do? I know it is used for many things, like panning voices of a polyphonic subpatch or offset the pitch on voices in a polyphonic subpatch.  

But what I am curious about is how much does the poly index affect the voices? How much are the second, third, forth voice values offset?  

For example pitch: is the first voice pitched 0 and the second voice pitched +1 and third voice pitched +2?  

Or is …

    On the microKorg for example you can change the voicing to be mono (only one voice plays), poly (normal polyphonic voice allocation), or unison (all voices play at once). I see the Deepmind has modes like unison 2 (2 voices play) etc. Can this be patched into a poly subpatch on the Axoloti? I keep thinking the polyindex object has to be involved in this but can't figure out how to do it :frowning: 

edit: 

I thought about it a little more. Sadly I am away from home for a few days without my Axo…

    Is there a way to select how many poly instances are active? Let's say I have a patcher with 16 voices,  something that would able to select from 1 to 16 voices? No midi input involved, just audio...
