    <title>DOD Gonkulator Style Ring Modulator</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/dod-gonkulator-style-ring-modulator/4379</link>
    <description>Hello!

I am just now getting into Axoloti (haven&#39;t bought it yet nor downloaded anything).

I am looking to make a Ring Modulator guitar stomp pedal (similar to the DOD Gonkulator). I do know the DOD Gonk Pedal has a locked pitch of Bb (B Flat) that it uses to do the math when it received the guitar signal.

I have searched the forums and haven&#39;t been able to find anything specific to my project.

Could any one help? Sorry if I have broken any rules.

Thanks!</description>

              <p>Hi Pinkerton,</p>

<p>the DOD Gonkulator is -as far as I know- a combination of a distortion and a ringmod pedal. For the ringmod part I can show you an example. It's not exactly the same you'll need, because it is based on the ringmod of the Yamaha CS-80.</p>

<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/d5e37d5dcfa7660a1c2fe1f51572bdff326bc625" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d5e37d5dcfa7660a1c2fe1f51572bdff326bc625.JPG" class="lightbox" title="Ting-test-ringmod.JPG"><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/d/d5e37d5dcfa7660a1c2fe1f51572bdff326bc625_1_690x353.JPG" width="690" height="353"><div class="meta">
<span class="filename">Ting-test-ringmod.JPG</span><span class="informations">1589x815 81.5 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>
</div></a></div></p>

<p><a class="attachment" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/9/93f07e6e0bc7719892efd6dc7c1945ca984b5905.axp">test-ringmod.axp</a> (5.1 KB)</p>

<p>The left part of the patch is a very basic synth for testing purposes only. It consists of a midi-input, a single saw-oscillator, a filter and a vca controlled via an ADSR-Envelope. On the far right side is the main volume and the audio output.</p>

<p>The interesting part is everything in the middle that has a label on it. <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>The ringmod AD envelope allows you to create a speeding up and/or down sound of the ringmod. The depth control regulates the amount of the envelope affecting the oscillator. You can omit these as the Gonkulator pedal has none of these.</p>

<p>The modulator is a simple sine oscillator with a speed control. You can use this control to tune it to whatever note you want...even to B flat, as in the pedal.</p>

<p>The math/* object does the actual ringmodulation.</p>

<p>In the mix object you can dial in how much of the not affected signal and how much of the modulated signal you want to hear.</p>

<p>I hope this is helpful to you.</p>

<p>PS: Buy your core! Fiddling and tinkering around with it will solve many questions. <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

              <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I would say: it is doable, and it doesn't seem to be difficult to do, and If you know roughly how the signal flows through the original, you could implement it in the patcher. It's a good idea to get a little bit into patching first. And since you haven't found  anything specific about it in the forum, that means it hasn't been done yet. so once you have  sketched something, you can post it and more members are able to help you with your project (patching, gpio, hardware, etc...). </p>

<p>I could also be totally wrong here, but doing a bit of ring modulation on an incoming signal, doesn't seem impossible to me. </p>

<p>Have you tired sketching it on other platforms first? Pure data, max, reaktor?</p>
