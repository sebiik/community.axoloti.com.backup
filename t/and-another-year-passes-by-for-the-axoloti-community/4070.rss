    <title>And another year passes by for the Axoloti community</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/and-another-year-passes-by-for-the-axoloti-community/4070</link>
    <description>Although I cannot say I was there in 2015, I was early 2016, and I just want to say thanks to all for 2017 and the challenges, hopefully not too many left over the next few days, I certainly would not be where I am without the support from you all on my project, I certainly hope you can all say the same and that we can further continue for 2018.:yum:

My current challenge is making 5 expression pedals rather then having to spend $50 each. I can only say one thing.. AAAAHHHHH ! %^&amp;^% :weary:
 :rofl:
All the best to the Axo community.. !:balloon:</description>

              <p>Happy new year to Axoloti users. </p>

<p>Let's celebrate with an Axoloti in space. It is way more hip than one of those regular regular cats on synth in space posts:</p>

<p>Shout-out to everyone who's contributed to the project.</p>
