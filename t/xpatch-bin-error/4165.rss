    <title>Xpatch.bin error</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/xpatch-bin-error/4165</link>
    <description>Hi , 

Trying to an axoloti running under windows 8.1. The unit works fine under osx however i get the following error when I attempt to compile a patch.

I would copy the error but there is no way to copy the text from the axoloti window. Going to the edit menu and choose ctrl+c as the option does not copy the text. 

I will type the error out.

When I navigate to that folder to see if xpatch.bin exists it does not.

The only file in that folder is called xpatch.cpp

Any advise welcome.

Thank you

              <p>I got the opportunity to check this again on my windows machine, and my first assumption was correct.<br>the compilation is not happening at all.<br>this is evident because not all the compilation messages that usually appear in the console are present, in particular the messages logged by the makefile (Makefile.patch to be specific)</p>

<p>this means that its one of:<br>- incorrect installation of runtime, or anti virus blocking, so make cannot run make correctly<br>- incorrect installation of Axoloti, or anti virus blocking , so the firmware makefile cannot be accessed (seems unlikely , as this would still create a make error)<br>- the firmware directory specific in the Axoloti.prefs been changed to something invalid, or has become corrupted. (again unlikely, surely a make error would occur)<br>- something blocking command tools running (anti virus?), possible but never seen before</p>

<p>anyway, given Teds lack of response/appreciation of my efforts, I guess he wont use this, <br>but hopefully if other stumble on something similar it might give further insights, if not an immediate solution.I can't give the solution , as in this particular case, Ive not been given enough information to get to the next step.</p>

<p>cool, then you should understand the difficultly...</p>

<p>1.0.12 is not a new release, its been successfully installed by many users on windows including 8.1.<br>Ive offered suggestions based on things we have seen crop up from time to time.</p>

<p>so the question has to be is... what is different about your setup (compared to those that had it working ok) ? once that is identified the solution will be forthcoming -  your attitude of 'its not my problem, its a general axoloti issue' , is frankly not helpful - we are not after 'blame' here... we are after differences that might cause issues.</p>

<p>you should also note in my 3rd post, I even explained to you the underlying problem (the file not being present, but appearing to have been compiled), my hope was this by explaining the issue, you might be able to contribute something more to the problem, something that might 'advance' the problem - give new clues</p>

<p>also you didn't say ... did you delete the build directly as i suggested?<br>another suggestion, if you edit the prefs file, you can turn on expert , then try to do a compile... but without upload, and see if the xpatch.bin is created.</p>

              <p>Hi , </p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>

<p>I un-installed axoloti completely. Both runtime and main program folder.</p>

<p>Re-installed everything again with no anti virus software even installed on my computer.</p>

<p>Exactly the same error occurs.</p>

<p>I am going to guess at this point your not going to attempt to provide any more 'support' and that as a user and customer I am 'shit out of luck'.</p>

<p>Not particularly helpful or re-assuring.</p>

<p>I have seen your comments about being unpaid help and frankly that is a bit sad.</p>

<p>Johannes (hope I have spelt that correctly apologies if not) this does not reflect very well on you here.</p>

<p>Some of us have invested quite heavily (in relative terms on this platform) I own 5 axoloti's myself.</p>

<p>I have been using the exclusively under osx till this point in time.</p>

<p>To just be told 'sorry I have no clue' is not really acceptable for a product you are taking money for.</p>

<p>Whilst I appreciate that when it comes to patching and the like that axoloti is a very buyer beware type product.</p>

<p>However when it  comes to installation and simple usage problems I do expect some what better help and support than some unpaid persons good will and knowledge.</p>

<p>I am not one to be critical usually but having read quite a few posts on this 'forum' I have to say the attitude towards helping users especially those who are less technical leaves a lot to be desired.</p>

<p>Being told 'I cannot think of any thing else' is not really acceptable. It is the typed version of shrugging and walking away. Not particularly conducive to the creation of warm and fuzzy feelings inside.</p>

<p>I know the problem is not user error or my pc being weird or what have you as I simply do not experience any kind of problems with any of piece of hardware I have of which I have many dev type boards attached and working without problem. I am not a clueless idiot with these types of things.</p>

<p>Any further advice/help welcome'd however I feel none is going to be forthcoming. Sadly.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

              <p>sorry no idea then... </p>

<p>if you haven't already try deleting the build directory (which axoloti is closed), perhaps something is corrupt in there. </p>

<p>after that, id probably start trying to run it from the command line to see if anything shows up, but honestly not seen this before - so not sure what to suggest.</p>

<p>other than that, delete everything axoloti/runtime/document directory and re-install...but just because i cant think of anything else.</p>

              <p>yeah, my thoughts are simple...</p>

<p>your logs show that compilation was successful... there is no error saying it cant file the compiler, or that  xpatch.cpp cannot be compiled.<br>the compilation will result in a file called xpatch.bin</p>

<p>so... that implies some thing is deleting or moving it, in between the compilation state and the upload stage.  as you can see from the error (FileNotFound) when it attempts to upload, its simply not there.</p>

<p>the question is where has it gone? what moved it?</p>

<p>the only thing i know of that moves things is anti virus software, when it becomes suspicious of a file it quarantines it.</p>

<p>what you could try to do, is to add the build directory (as noted in your logs) to the anti virus exclusion list - and try again.</p>

<p>really thats the only idea i have, i cannot see why else it would successfully compile, yet not have a file to upload.</p>

              <p>Hi , </p>

<p>What specifically do you think I should be looking for in the logs?</p>

<p>There is nothing there that pertains to axoloti in anyway that I can see. I saw no virus warnings when installing either the axoloti runtime or the .msi installer.</p>

<p>The axoloti_runtime folder is in program files(x86) as expected.</p>

<p>I have checked my java installation and according to the java application everything is installed as it should be. I installed the version linked from the axoloti site. 1.81 I believe.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>basically the patch didn't compile... and so you should have had a whole bunch of errors.<br>the usual  reason for this is the Runtime is not installed, or not installed correctly, or your anti virus is blocking it.</p>
