    <title>VOCAL HARMONIZER via MIDI</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/vocal-harmonizer-via-midi/3643</link>
    <description>Hello there,

Thank you very much  for taking interest in this topic, my skills in Axoloti patching are plain bad. I was wondering if anyone has explored the possibillities for a real time vocal harmonizer (like this awesome [Jacob Collier] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnpVAyPjxDA) stuff) as shown in the picture below (taken from [this post](http://forum.critterandguitari.com/t/vocal-harmonizer-collier-bon-iver/1108) on an Organelle forum). 

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1ea9c6b43ca211b56d50d50d4a280cb10fa11801.jpg&quot; width=&quot;407&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;

He uses a custom box built by MIT and specifys exactly what notes it harmonizes via midi controller. Sounds to me that he also has some vocoder effect added. Such a classy vibe.

Thanks guys</description>

              <p>I'm surprised no one replied to this, looks quite easy to do and I've often wondered about something like this.</p>

<p>I can't remember whether I just saw talk about it or an actual release of a pitch-shifter object, but basically, that's what you need for this.  I think it was either Remco (SirSickSik) or Robert (rbrt) who made one.</p>

<p>Assuming you find a pitch-shifter object, all this would need is for the audio to fed into various pitch-shifter objects where the pitch-shifter gets it's shift amount from MIDI note information.  The MIDI note information gathered from a MIDI object that is fed with your keyboard or whatever.  The original audio and the various pitch-shifted audio would then be fed into a mixer so that you can hear all pitches at the same time, and change the levels as you feel fit.</p>

<p>I hope that helps a little, I can't be sure about any of this as my Axo computer is currently out of action, but I'm pretty sure as long as there's a pitch-shift object somewhere in the library, it would be perfectly doable.</p>
