    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/lexicon-and-self-education/3893</link>
    <description>Hello all,
I&#39;ve had my Axoloti for the last couple months and I&#39;m really impressed and satisfied with my purchase. My objective is in using its flexible patching abilities (I also have a Nord Micro and 9U of Eurorack) to be used in my overall production of finished musical works. 

Toward that end, I see the need to learn some of the specifics about how the Axoloti operates - and am used to this confronting this circumstance when I have acquired new gear and software in the past. The difficulty I am having with Axoloti in specific is in teaching myself how some of the programming aspects are laid out. 

For instance, I am familiar with modular synthesis and have seen how different terminology is used in the Axoloti for similar functions/concepts (boolean instead of gate) etc. In this example, it was fairly simple to look up the term, read a bit and make the connection. Another example was &quot;dirac&quot; which I concluded meant a trigger (or at least functioned as such in that particular case). 

Currently I am investigating tables, what they do and how they are used (I&#39;m mostly interested in exploring wavetables) but I&#39;m having a lot of difficulty with the terms used, what the functions of those terms indicate and how they relate to each other. As a result, I can&#39;t figure out the basics of how to even use them (please note that it is on my to-do list to pick apart what I can from these threads:
http://community.axoloti.com/t/wavetable-how-to-create1-cycle-wavetable-tutorial-w-examples/912
http://community.axoloti.com/t/the-xylobox-wavetable-synthesizer-hardware-patches/1353).

Rather than ask specific questions, what I&#39;m looking for overall is some guidance on how to educate myself better with this unknown lexicon used frequently in the Axoloti. Do I need a &quot;DSP dictionary,&quot; or should I be consulting some 101-level computer science guide? Yes, the help patches are useful, and I have also trawled the forum but I&#39;m still just wanting to be able to look up each term for a definition and then conclude its function and relationship to other unknown terms, etc. 

I hope what I&#39;m attempting to convey is clear. Could someone assist me with a resource like this?</description>

<p>I was afraid of a response like this. What if the best way to figure it out is to have access to a full, exhaustive access to the concepts and terms?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the descriptions are far too terse to be useful to me in regard to tables...</p>

I just flicked together this tutorial on how to create one cycle waveforms for Axoloti. You can use it instead on an oscillator and gives some new options. Anyway here goes:
