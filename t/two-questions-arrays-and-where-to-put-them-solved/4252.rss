    <description>hi there,

i have some large arrays like this:

&lt;code&gt;

0xa9,0x5d,0xd6,0x33,0xc3,0x03};



uint8_t *words[2] = {spKETTENFETT, spZUCKER};
&lt;/code&gt;

and i adress them via the words pointer. this all works beautifully.

currently this all resides in my local data of the object.

my two questions are:

1) how do i force those arrays into sdram? i tried using __attribute__ ((section (&quot;.sdram&quot;))) but i always get an fpermissive error... if somebody could guide me here that would be great. i still need to be able to point to those arrays with the words pointer.

2) is there a way to put those arrays into a separate object and access the data from the main object? i would put all the arrays and the words pointer into the separate object.</description>

<p>I've tried adding this block to the XML definition of the object:</p>

              <p>Yeah the point of this is the user doesn’t know the data is held in a file, it’s automatic to them. (Like lmnts)</p>

<p>The only thing to becareful of is they have to use an sdcard, which theoretically is not a requirement , but in practice most users have.  </p>

<p>Again, just to repeat (as important) this is designed for initializing /allocating data at startup , if you keep allocating/freeing you are likely to have issues. <br>Also remember a patch can only take a certain amount of time, otherwise initialisation will timeout.<br>(Can’t remember off hand what that timeout is)</p>

<p>Also remember to check return value from the Malloc , the more object developers use this, the more likely users are to run out of sdram during initialisation... and if you don’t log the failure, they’ll just start complaining of boards ‘crashing’</p>

              <p>Hi All!</p>

<p>Coming late to this thread, but I'm just wondering if the above offers a solution to a problem I had when working on my LPC objects.</p>

<p>One of my objects requires a number of pre-defined multi-dimensional arrays. I'd like put them directly into SDRAM somehow, and ideally, also make them available to other objects. I don't want to load the data from a binary file on the SD card.</p>

<p>Is this possible using any of the methods outlined above? Sorry if this has been covered already. It's been a while since I worked on any Axoloti coding, so it's taking me a while to get back into the swing of things.</p>

class Fly{
public:
      static uint32_t datafly;

<p>note: normally this would not be done in the header file, but in the compilable module (C file) ... but thats not used in axo.</p>

<p>however, what I do, is still break up my C code into headers and C files, and then just include the C file in the header file.<br>this means that when axoloti supports compilable modules, you can easily move your code into proper modules, as its already split correctly. <br>for 'trivial examples' though not necessary as you'd probably never want to go to the effort of having a separate module.</p>

              <p>ok, the thing to realise is these 'tricks' are only really necessary because each instance of an object is created as a separate class, and so access is restricted, because that class name is the instance name of the object... so you cant reference it easily.</p>

<p>so for complex objects, i think its much easier to just define a new class in a  header file, which you then include (object editor supports include)<br>that way you know what the class name is called, so you can easily implement a singleton pattern. (which is basically just a static pointer wrapped in a class)</p>

<p>it perhaps sounds complex, but in reality its a couple of lines of code... and also provides a perfect place to put 'common' code e.g. loading your data from the file.</p>

<p>(its a pity i didn't structure the Push object like this, not quite sure why i did it using C functions... was a long time ago <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ) </p>

<p>tip... what i do when looking at this kind of thing, is look at the xpatch.cpp (run it thru a pretty print), it then becomes fairly clear the C++ 'syntax issues' your seeing... I guess that's why I also don't think exclusively in terms of axo object, and more just in how it looks in C++.</p>

<p>lmnts, nah, it (stupidly) loads the data per instance... because i kind of knew you could only have one instance of it... partly due to cpu, and iirc, the MI code has some statics which cause issues with multiple instances.</p>

              <p>ok, <a class="mention" href="/u/thetechnobear">@thetechnobear</a>, i have one other question, if you don't mind. as i wrote i was successful in mallocing some sdram space. my object works great with this. since i though about loading multiple instances that would use the same data, can i also do the <br><code>[parent -&gt; polyIndex][0] </code> trick with the array i allocated dynamically to access the data from more than one object? or do i have to initialise a pointer via <br><code>[attr_poly][LENGTH] <strong>attribute</strong> ((section (".sdram")))</code> and point that to the location of the array that i malloced in sdram? either way, i cannot get it to work <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> but maybe this is also not possible. i could not see from your code how/if you do that in the elements code. what happens if you open more then one instance of those?</p>

<p>probably not a good idea if you look at what <a class="mention" href="/u/thetechnobear">@thetechnobear</a> wrote a couple of posts above. <br>sdram_malloc() should only be used in the init section of an object...</p>

              <p>ok i created a custom object that writes two arrays, one with all the data, one with all the offsets (sizes of different data) to sdcard. i did this all with attributes, so i can insert all the data into a textfield, select the size of the data etc. this works! though i have a strong feeling, once i try to put in more data into the array then what fits into sram i will have to figure out another way <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/jaffasplaffa">@jaffasplaffa</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/thetechnobear">@thetechnobear</a> for the suggestions, now on to allocating dynamically based on file size <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
