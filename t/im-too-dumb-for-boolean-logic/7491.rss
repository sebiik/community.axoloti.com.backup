    <title>I&#39;m too dumb for boolean logic</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/im-too-dumb-for-boolean-logic/7491</link>
    <description>The situation:

I have 2 parameters, A and B, both are integer values between 0-60 in steps of 4 (0, 4, 8...52, 56, 60). A is controlled by a knob, B is chosen randomly on every tick of a bang.

I would like to add a second knob, which increases the probability of the value B being chosen in stead of A, each time the same bang that randomises B ticks. So knob is at 0 = always A, knob at 64 = always B.

I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the age or self-inflicted brain damage, but I just can&#39;t work it this simple maths/logic problem.</description>
