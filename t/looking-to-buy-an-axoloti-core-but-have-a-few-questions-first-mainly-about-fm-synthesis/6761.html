        <p>Forgive me if all of these questions have been asked/answered independently of each other in different threads, but I couldn't find the specific answers, so I'm asking here!</p>

<p>I'm fascinated by this wonderful tool and would really like to get one myself. Before getting one, I want to make sure that it will do the things I want it to do (in reality, the core can already do far more than most other products that are at a higher price point). </p>

<p>So I would want the Axoloti to be the digital supplemental to the analog synth that I have. In having that, I would like it to perform some exclusively digital functions. They are thus:</p>

<ul>
<li>Musical FM Synthesis: Looking for something that does musically pitched FM synthesis (a la the DX7, or the Volca FM) with operators and carriers, and all that good stuff. </li>
<li>Sound Design FM Synthesis: Also looking for something less musical and more "dubsteppy", with gritty dynamic sounds</li>
<li>Switching between patches: This is more of a hardware question I guess... Since the musical FM and the sound design FM are in sort of different worlds, I would like to be able to switch between multiple patches with a knob or button, if possible. </li>
</ul>

<p>Bonus, but not necessary whatsoever: Granular synthesis</p>

<p>Thanks for your time! (I'll probably end up getting one either way!)</p>

        <p>fm (or rather pm) is no problem on the axoloti. both "musical" and "gritty" (this depends a lot on harmonic relation between operators) i had great success with a gritty dubsteppy sound by using triangle wave oscillators as operators. aliasing can be an issue then, but in gritty land that may even be desired. happy patching!!</p>

        <p>Thank you for your reply! Can you tell me if you can switch patches with it? If I understand correctly, each patch is like its own file that you load into the axoloti, so could you essentially switch between 2 or more patches/files?</p>

        <p>switching patches is also possible, yes. there will be a small gap (around 200ms i guess) between the two on loading.</p>

<p>granular stuff is also possible</p>
