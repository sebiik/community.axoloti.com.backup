    <title>Unable to chage Email address....... FIXED</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/unable-to-chage-email-address-fixed/5901</link>
    <description>Trying to change my email address as my 20 Plus year just dropped my account.  Have new email, went to change and edit it but no response came to allow change?
&quot;We&#39;ve sent an email to that address. Please follow the confirmation instructions.&quot; (never got email, have changed other sites with no issues).

Dummy me, did not notice that it was in my SPAM email folder, all OK.</description>
