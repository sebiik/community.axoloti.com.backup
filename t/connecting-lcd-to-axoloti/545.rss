    <title>Connecting LCD to Axoloti</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/connecting-lcd-to-axoloti/545</link>
    <description>Would it be hard to use an lcd of some sort to have some feedback from the hardware when not connected to the computer ? Like visualizing parameters values, patch name etc .   
Just wondering .</description>

<p>if you check the firmware, updateDisplay() its reasonably clear.<br>as Ive pointed out previously, its subject to change... since when we fully implement controllers like Push/Axoloti Control ... the requirements will become clearer. <br>(e.g. currently updateDisplay pushes a rendered image, they may or may not the final solution)</p>

              <p>Hi,<br>Thanks a lot for answering my question.<br>I was thinking about the axoloti remote current implementation though i haven't had the time to check the code yet.<br>I did some C at school but im a Java developper by trade so i guess im not going to be completely lost but i understand its going to be a challenge. <br>Im curious about your 'push' implementation, great idea i think though im not familiar with this controller.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/users/sovietpop">@sovietpop</a> its going to be both a software and hardware challenge, so depends upon your experience.</p>

<p>I can't say much on the hardware side, <br>but can on the software (as I've been digging around with this on the Ableton Push).</p>

<p>First you have to be an experience C/C++ programmer, as your going to need to understand the firmware code, and your going to need to write your own 'driver' to drive the LCD.</p>

<p>The code is kind of in place to push an image to an LCD with the functionality of 'axoloti remote', see the virtual version in the GUI, but you would have to tailor this depending on size of display etc.<br>but this is a bit limited in some ways e.g. it cannot visualise step sequencers, and has no notion of units.</p>

<p>with the push I've taken a different approach which is to query the parameters directly, and have got the same level of functionality and beyond, with the real advantage i can organise things exactly as I want.</p>

<p>but... there are currently some limitations, and I think mid-term we will need to enhance the parameter/controller interface a bit.<br>I plan to do a bit of this to implement the push, and of course its also likely to be addressed when/if <a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> resurrects AxolotiRemote ... when we do this, its very likely the API will be a bit more open, so that controllers can be added., and of course if the code is open source, it will allow people to have a reference to see how its done.</p>

<p>so summary is, yes its possible, but on the software side you will need to be a reasonably experienced programmer.... and also probably good with hardware too <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>but watch this space, its definitely an area which I want to make improvements in.</p>

  <blockquote>Hello everyone, I've been playing with my axoloti and imagining some potential hardware designs for it, and I picked up a few components to use in a mono-synth box I want to build. I have a rotary encoder and 2-digit seven-segment display that I'd like to use for patch or parameter changes, and I picked up a an MCP23S17 16-bit digital IO expander (<a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/21952b.pdf" rel="nofollow">datasheet here</a>) so as not to use up 14 pins for the display alone. So I've been trying for two days now and still can't get any output from the GPIO pâ€¦
