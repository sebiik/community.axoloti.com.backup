    <title>Object request: wave/play fn stereo (w. pitch) UPDATED</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/object-request-wave-play-fn-stereo-w-pitch-updated/529</link>
    <description>I think it would be really great with a wave/play fn stereo w. pitch. 

I know there is a table with pitch coming, but I am not having much luck with using tables and I am getting closer to what I would like with the wave player. And a pitch input for this one wold be really really useful for sample manipulation because you can load larger files than in the tables. If you want to make some really nice granular modulation it is kind of essential to be able to load larger files, which you of my knowledge can&#39;t do in tables. Max 8 megabyte I think it is.

**Just a few thoughts on how I understand the difference between wave objects and table objects:**

From what I understand the wave objects acts like a regular sampler; you can load samples and actually still hear the contend of the sample. 

The tables are more like wavetables, small snippets of audio, down to one cycle sounds, which you cannot hear the original contend of the file you load into it. For example on Blofeld synth I have made a lot of custom wavetables from audiofiles but you cannot hear any content of the original wavefile, because the snippets of audio are very small. They kind of just make new material, with almost nothing sonically in common with the original file. 

Is this correct? Or is it also possible to load samples in tables that will still be recognisable longer pieces of audio? Like I mentioned I haven&#39;t really had much luck with loading samples into tables, like with wave objects, so still very much a noob on this this path. The name table made me compare tables to wavetables.


I know Johannes have mentioned that the wave play fn pitch object is not coming in near future, but I though I&#39;d make the request anyway if anyone else are interested. Maybe a release or two down it will be taken in consideration.</description>

<p>That is not correct.<br>When using sdram tables, memory can hold up to a total of 83 seconds of sound at 48kHz/16bit.</p>
