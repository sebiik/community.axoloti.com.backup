              <p>I hope we are going to get a release of 1.0.9 out soon.... as my last testing seems to show its ok.<br>(though it may be <a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> knows of issues thats needs to be resolved )</p>

<p>the short answer, is like most software, its upwardly compatible only.<br>the community library, and other new features/objects will never be added to 1.0.6</p>

<p>I think your really asking the wrong question, the right one is ... how do I get 1.0.8 working on my computer?<br>as this is the future.</p>

              <p>Hey</p>

<p>The community library is, as far as I know, restricted to version 1.08. </p>

<p>It has not been implemented yet in version 1.06.</p>
