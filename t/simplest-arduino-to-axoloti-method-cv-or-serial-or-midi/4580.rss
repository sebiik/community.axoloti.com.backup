    <title>Simplest Arduino to Axoloti method (CV or Serial or midi)</title>

    <description>Hi, 

_Quick version_ : 
What is the easiest way to convert a float variable in arduino nano to micro tonal pitch in Axoloti  (like the hakken continuum or a theremin)  ? 

_Strange version :_ 
First I saw the multiple discussion on arduino to axoloti and they all try to achieve fairly complex connection (for me, as a beginner in all this) i&#39;m looking for something simpler since it &#39;s my first project with both. 

I have an arduino NANO which for the moment print the variable i want in the consol/monitor of the IDE. It&#39;s a FLOAT variable that change over time I want to convert it to pitch (or something else but pitch is a good place start). It would sound like a theremin or a ribbon synth since I don&#39;t want to map the value to notes. 

First I didn&#39;t want to use Midi because i felt it would be realy hard to code a continuum and not outpout do do# re re# mi etc. 
Then I tried going through CV (or analog input on the axoloti) but I need a DAC and it&#39;s quite a bit of world I don&#39;t fully understand (I tried with a resitor and a capacitor on a microbrute CV IN and with random inputs on axoloti : didn&#39;t work, that PWM output of the arduinos analogWrite is quite not as cool as it sound). 
Their is the serial which seems quite easy on the hardware side but I don&#39;t know C. 
So the 3 options are pretty attractive to me but since I&#39;m new to this I don&#39;t know which one would be the fastest path to control the pitch of axoloti with arduino. 
Thanks</description>

              <p>If I were doing this, I would convert the float to a suitable range of ints (say 0-255 mapped for 8 bit) and then send it out on 8 pins to the axoloti, which would then read those 8 pin values to a 0-255 number. Seems a bit convoluted and not as elegant, but that's my two cents.</p>
