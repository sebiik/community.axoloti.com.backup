    <title>Whoa... this is cool (albeit slow)</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/whoa-this-is-cool-albeit-slow/6430</link>
    <description>An experiment that turned out, sort of, functional (despite my initial thoughts)... but it is slow.

Axoloti &gt; usb cable &gt; Upboard microcomputer (Intel Atom, 1.44GHz, 4GB RAM, 64GB eMMC, OS: WIN 10) + USB WiFi  &gt; TeamViewer App (in WIN 10) &gt; TeamViewer App (on Android smartphone).

Takes a minute to start the patcher (so it is obviously probably not suited for programming duties). But given that my upboard will not protest against an hdmi dummy headless ghost emulator that I am planning to buy tomorrow (which it shouldn´t do as it should not be able to tell the difference of it vs an real hdmi screen). 

I can then use my android smartphone screen as my &#39;main&#39; display if I ever need to see the workspace of the patcher and don´t have my usual laptop with me.

This &#39;setup&#39; seems to work for my Nord Modular G2 Engine editor as well...

The Upboard (first model) looks almost exactly as an raspberry pi, with same physical size.</description>
