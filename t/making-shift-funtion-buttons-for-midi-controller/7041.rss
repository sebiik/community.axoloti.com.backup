    <title>Making shift/funtion buttons for MIDI controller</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/making-shift-funtion-buttons-for-midi-controller/7041</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to create a subpatch that allows me to turn a row of 8 buttons on a MIDI controller (specifically for the Novation Launch Control XL, but the same could be applied to any amount of similar controllers) into shift/function buttons for 8 faders, effectively multiplying my amount of faders by 9 (unshifted + 8x with shift buttons). 

I have managed to get this to work, relying heavily on the &quot;rbrt/control/gate_hold&quot; object, but there are two major problems:

1) while any of the shift buttons are pressed, the CC from the unshifted group is also sent. Is there a way to multiply/sum bools in such a way that the unshifted group is filtered out while any of the shift buttons are pressed?

2) when any of the shift buttons are pressed, the CC values of all 8 faders in that shift group are updated. I would want that only a fader that is moved while pressing shift is updated, not all of them. I&#39;ve tried chaining 2 &quot;rbrt/control/gate_hold&quot; objects in series (one gated by the shift button, one gated by the trig output of the &quot;midi/in/cc&quot; objects of the individual faders), but this has no effect. How could I go about that?
