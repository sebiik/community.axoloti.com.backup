    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/mac-os-sierra-and-axoloti/2255</link>
    <description>has anyone tested Axoloti on Sierra yet?

I have not, and I will not be able to for the foreseeable future, as I have some hardware/software that is allegedly not working yet on Sierra, 
[s]so I need my MBP and iMac both to remain on 10.11.6 for now. - so I will **not** be upgrading yet.[/s]
**Ive now upgraded my MBP to Sierra (10.12.0), see below for results**
I do realise however, that good things are being said about Sierra vs El Capitan, so will be upgrading as soon as the software/hardware I use, gives the all clear :)  

What does this mean for users? 

Whilst I wouldn&#39;t expect problems, until there is a developer in a position to upgrade, we wont be able to resolve any issues that do arise on Sierra. so I would not recommend upgrading at this time.

(generally, its work with Mac OS waiting for the dot maintenance releases before upgrading e.g. 10.12.1 or 2)

IF someone does upgrade, can you please use this thread, to post your experiences.
e.g. does it work? what issues to you face? 
(please be very careful they are really Sierra issues i.e. they don&#39;t occur on 10.11.6)

Note: DAWs, Plugns and other Hardware manufactures are reporting issues, so you would be advised to check all your software/hardware before attempting an upgrade.



Testing Status:
so I upgrade my MBP, here&#39;s where I&#39;m at so far, testing is NOT complete, so upgrade at your own risk ;) 

Tested with: MBP / 10.12.0 / Axoloti 1.0.11
Overall: No issues encountered **so far**
Tested: (generally quite limited)
- Axoloti Firmware upload - ok
- Axoloti UI - compile, upload, run patch, adjust parameters - ok
- Axoloti Patch Editing - move objects, delete, move wires, add objects - ok
- Axoloti Libraries - sync , see objects  - ok 
- Axoloti Object editor - seems ok, but not done any read editing yet.
- CPU - appears to be same as 10.11, as far as i can tell.

so overall, with limited testing, Sierra does not appear to have introduced any new issues. of course more testing is required... and also for longer &#39;sessions&#39;</description>
