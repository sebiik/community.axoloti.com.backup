    <title>Exploring creating a curriculum for school with Axolotl?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/exploring-creating-a-curriculum-for-school-with-axolotl/6079</link>
    <description>Hi there, 

I am an axoloti newbie, longtime synth tweaker, and a part time teacher. 

I am exploring using the axoloti as a platform to introduce concepts of sound design, dsp, synthesis, programing logic, product design, at my sons school (middle school - high school) ... 

Just wondering if any of you have done something like this and might be able to share your experience.

Thank you.</description>

              <p>I have taught some workshops with Axoloti based on my book and it's a very good tool for explaining all of the concepts you mention. I mainly had adults participating in the workshops, but teenagers interested in technology should be able to work with the software.</p>
