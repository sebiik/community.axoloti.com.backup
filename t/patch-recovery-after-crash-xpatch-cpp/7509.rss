    <title>Patch recovery after crash (xpatch.cpp)</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/patch-recovery-after-crash-xpatch-cpp/7509</link>
    <description>Fairly often it happens that the axoloti patcher crashes on my computer, making me lose all the last changes I made to a patch. Most of the times I make sure I save the patch every 15 minutes or so, but sometimes it hangs while trying to save the patch, corrupting the saved file or I forgot to save for over an hour, making me lose everything..

I know I can open the xpatch.cpp file (build-directory), which shows the code that was used the last time it went live, but it&#39;s quite a hassle to rebuild a project module by module and trying to remember how everything was connected.

Is there any way to convert the xpatch.cpp-file back to a working editor-patch directly?</description>

              <p>did anyone else experience these patcher-crashes/hangs in the meantime?</p>

<p>I still have these crashes quite regularly, but I did notice some things in the meantime:</p>

<p>-the longer I work on a patch without closing and reopening the patcher to renew things, the bigger the chance the program hangs (during play, at some point I notice that knobs respond with more and more latency, starting to get "jumpy". Display's update less frequently, completely skipping parts of data coming from the board). It also takes longer and longer for patches to go live.</p>

<p>-it happens most often to patches containing changing displays/knobs (eg using PExParameterChange(&amp;parent-&gt;PExch[PARAM_INDEX_attr_legal_name_value],inlet_in,0xFFFD)). Though also without these, it WILL happen at some point when working on something for several hours (perhaps caused by changing knob values manually?).. (though also, I often did momentarily add some display to read things out for bugfixing, perhaps this stays in memory too?)</p>

<p>-when it happens I often also have a blinking "asus auto update" notice (which, I assume, doesn't do anything anymore as this computer is way to old to still get updates). It also seems to happen more often when I have some java game running on chrome.</p>

<p>From the experiences of what and when thing happen, I get the idea that everytime you go live, you assign some new memory for things on the computer, but when you go unlive, it doesn't clear this. And next time you go live again, it just takes up more memory besides the previous memory that's still allocated somehow.</p>
