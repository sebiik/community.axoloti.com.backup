    <title>Using custom directory locations</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/using-custom-directory-locations/3387</link>
    <description>Some users may need to use different directory locations for their setup, due to permissioning or using things like remote profiles.

**important note**
This is considered advanced use only, you must know how to configure for your operating system.
Incorrect usage **will** cause issues. Also it will make it difficult for others to support you, since your files will not be in the &#39;usual&#39; locations, an assumption most will make. (so make sure you mention this if you are posting a problem)

environment variables for modifying locations are:
 
**axoloti_home** - location of the axoloti document home, e.g. where preferences and libraries are stored

**axoloti_runtime** - the location of the &#39;runtime applications&#39; , e.g. compilers
**axoloti_release** - the location of the axoloti application

**axoloti_firmware** - location of the axoloti firmware (advanced use only)

note: some operating system will require you to logout/restart computer to take effect.


if you change any of these variables, it is recommended that the next time you start Axoloti you do it from the command line (using cmd.exe/bash/terminal etc) , as when Axoloti starts it reports issues about missing directories etc to the &#39;standard out&#39;  **not** the Axoloti console.


for the location of the libraries, (factory, community), you are also able to change this in preferences, and then edit the library... once you change the local directory, you will need to do init for that library.
(this is not often needed, since its placed in axoloti_home, which if you having issues is most likely needed to be changes, since this is where axoloti.prefs is stored)



again... for **most** users this is unnecessary, since Axoloti by default uses recommend locations for each operating systems. so do not change unless you absolutely must... even then its probably best to ask first!</description>
