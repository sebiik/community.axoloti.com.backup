    <title>Patching a Gate - Delay/Looper/Echo</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/patching-a-gate-delay-looper-echo/4936</link>
    <description>I&#39;d like to patch a trigger/gate delay/looper (echo) &amp; not sure how to.
It would be great if the object &quot;delayedpulsedurationm&quot; had a feedback control, so with sufficient feedback it would become a gate-looper. Controlling &quot;delay&quot; would change the loop-length.
I have this idea from the hardware-box Flame Echometer I had some time ago.
Putting Echo on Trigger/Gate signals can give repeated patterns (loops) &amp; playing with delay-time spits out bursts &amp; all kind of weird, mangled rhythms!
One can experience this &quot;effect&quot; with some electribe boxes &amp; volca beats:
having echo on drums with a high feedback you can &quot;re-sample&quot; yourself twisting the time-knob &amp; creating funky-fresh overdubbed poly-blabla rhythms.
When one does this with gate signals, one is free to change the signal which gets triggered, by this echoed gate-mush.
Let me know any ideas on this? Thanks!!</description>
