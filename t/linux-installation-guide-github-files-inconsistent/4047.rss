    <title>Linux Installation Guide/Github files inconsistent</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/linux-installation-guide-github-files-inconsistent/4047</link>
    <description>I&#39;m new here so I could easily have missed something but step 1 of the Linux install guide includes: 
&quot;download axo_runtime_linux_(version).tgz
download axoloti_linux_(version).tgz&quot;

However, the second of these files isn&#39;t listed on github under &#39;Latest release&#39; (1.0.12). 

Is the guide out of date or is the file missing?

There&#39;s a .deb file but I&#39;m on OpenSuse so that&#39;s not useful to me. I need the .tgz (or an .rpm).

Thanks.</description>

              <p>I guess the instructions could be improved a bit to say that support is for 64-bit Debian/Ubuntu out of the box, and other distros if you compile it yourself. I'm sure that if someone has the time to do some testing that would be appreciated.</p>

<p>In any case, to actually try to help, there's also a program called <code>alien</code> that perhaps could help with converting the <code>.deb</code> files to other formats. I'm not sure if it will work, necessarily, but it's probably worth a shot.</p>

<p>Any OS works fine if you just do browsing, depends on the end user. But yeah, Linux is more like a hot rod, you might need to pop the hood and do some wrenching on occasion.</p>

<p>Bitwig, who are a relatively big company, and well known for Linux support, only support (drumroll) Ubuntu... <br>(and you dont have the option to build it yourself) </p>

<p>Tracktion (funded by Roli) , also tout Linux support, and guess what , they only support (drumroll) Ubuntu</p>

<p>as i said, its just a practical thing, Linux support cannot mean every Distro is supported, because there are loads of them, and the users all equally fight that their distro is the best/most popular , blah bla.</p>

<p>as I said, I love linux, I use it all the time, have for years, and whilst its made good progress to be a more 'consumer friendly' desktop, frankly, many who recommend it to non-technical users are mistaken due to these kind of issues.</p>

<p>thats something you will have to take up with Johannes.<br>Im a contributor (not the product owner, nor derive anything from axo sales) , and was trying to explain the reason/issues behind this - not to debate it.</p>

<p>if your an 'end user' , why not use/install Ubtunu? its one of the biggest and best supported distros, and whilst, I agree the axoloti website says linux is supported -  ever since release/July 2015, the 'installing on linux' user guide entry,  has said we recommend Ubuntu... ( i know, I wrote it).</p>

<p>if you wanted to use something else, it would have been prudent to ask first.</p>

<p>how to proceed... well my recommendation is simple.<br>either switch to Ubuntu or go look at how to build , we provide instructions, and many other users have done it... often its not much more than calling build.sh</p>

<p>err, if your using a standard linux distro, like opensuse, it already has compilers and such like installed, the only extra compiler your going to be installing is the the cross compiler for ARM, which you need to have to use Axoloti (rather than to 'build' it)</p>

<p>sorry, thats a typo (which Ive just fixed) it should say axoloti_linux_(version).deb</p>

<p>we only provide a prebuilt form in the Debian format for 64 bit, as this is what we use for building/testing.</p>

<p>for other linux distros you can build from source, which some kind community members have been extending the support for other time.</p>

<p>providing other package formats - sorry, its a simple numbers games for support, there are a tiny number of linux users compared to windows/mac, and even then they use different many distros - in an ideal world that would require at least 6 package variations just for linux ... whereas we put out a single mac and windows package which supports, something like 98% of users!<br>(bare in mind, its not just packaging, if you supply various formats, they also all need testing)</p>

<p>as a developer, and keen advocate of linux, I hope one day, the distros will come together and sort this packaging mess out.</p>
