    <title>Axoloti used by STUFF., a Belgian jazz band</title>

    <description>I was pleased to see a band called STUFF. perform at Pukkelpop, a festival in Belgium a week ago. One of the guys was wearing an Axoloti tshirt (see pic). I think they used an Axoloti as a sound source for an electric clarinet.

Now I realised they actually have a song that&#39;s definitely inspired by Axoloti:

I think we should be proud to have such great musicians part of the community. :grinning:</description>

              <p>The electronic clarinet player is quite active with the Axoloti. He even gave a workshop on it somewhere.  Lander Gyselinck, the drummer of the band also has been experimenting with Axoloti. I'm not sure if the drummer uses it on stage.</p>
