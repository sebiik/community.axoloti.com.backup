    <title>Novation Nocturn 25 - working?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/novation-nocturn-25-working/2133</link>
    <description>Hi all. I&#39;m new at the forum and new with Axoloti so bear with me. 

I&#39;m trying to connect my old Novation Nocturn 25 with no luck. Is there something I need to do to connect an external device or can I use the same midi/in/keyb as for the software keyboard?

Thanks.</description>

<p>No, afraid I didn't investigate that in the end.</p>

              <p>The effort to support non-MIDI-class compliant devices seems disproportional here. I believe Novation could support their customers by releasing an updated firmware that is MIDI-class-compliant, not only relevant for Axoloti...

<p>The console log says: </p>

<p>Axoloti says: USB Device Attached<br>Axoloti says: USB Device Attached</p>

<p>But nothing happens when I press the keys on the controller. </p>

<p>So... maybe buy a new controller then?</p>

<p>Thanks again for the quick replies.</p>

              <p>Id like to see the console log BUT...</p>

<p>this and the associated code for linux,  would seem to imply it is not USB MIDI class compliant but uses its own midi protocol.</p>

<p>note: they seem to refer to the 'novation nocturn controller' its not 100% clear there weren't different models (which i believe there were), and if so if they all followed the same protocol.</p>

<p>EDIT: <a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a>, the following linux commit is quite interesting....<br><a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=dab9981756dbc3c50c194811f176f0d658c171af" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=dab9981756dbc3c50c194811f176f0d658c171af</a></p>

<p>it adds the nocturn to the 'quirks' list, and that quirks header is <em>really</em> interesting, basically lists quite a few devices, where they aren't conforming, but seems with some 'little twists' they can be catered for.<br>for midi there seems 2 popular 'use-case' quirks, MIDI_RAW_BYTES (old novation products), and fixed end points.</p>

<p>(of course the issue is catering for quirks for devices could easily get out of control... and impossible to test if a developer doesn't have the device to test with... but its interesting to at least 'know about')</p>

<p>EDIT2: after a quick look at the linux midi code...<br>ok, it <strong>looks</strong> like, on first glance, raw midi quirk, basically is just treat the usb data as midi... so none of normal CIN/port packet header that is required of the USB MIDI class compliant.<br>there is also another 'novation' quirk, which again is without header BUT have to strip length data from the usb data.<br>again, this is just 'scan' of the source code....</p>

<p>(oh, and the novation products with this quirk also appear to need the fixed endpoint quirk)</p>

<p>as i said though, this doesn't solve the 'how to deal with this reasonably' , as i couldn't implement, as I cannot test... and adding lots of quirks for various controllers, could lead to quite alot of firmware 'bloat'.<br> (its ok for linux, which is most often run on a full-fat computer <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=2" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> )</p>
