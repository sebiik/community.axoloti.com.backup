    <description>Patching once you get familiar with Axoloti is easy and fun... but initially facing a empty patch when you start can be pretty daunting, here we discuss a few resources which help you get started:

The key thing is Axoloti patching is fun, it&#39;s about exploration... go wild, experiment ... you cannot break anything :smile:

Help : Press F1 or select Help from the menu, this will give you access to the user guide

**VERY IMPORTANT:**  When **creating a new patch, ensure GAIN LEVEL IS LOW initially** and gradually increase it. Do NOT start at maximum gain.  Just as with any sound synthesis, initially your patch may not operate as you expect and this could damage your speakers or worse, your hearing.

YouTube : [Axoloti YouTube channel][1] , includes getting started videos

Tutorials :  Axoloti includes many tutorial patches which go from the very basics of patching to more complex concepts, its recommended you go through at least the initial ones.

Examples : Axoloti includes lots of examples, these range from simple synth patches to some very complex sequencing patches, which form the basis of an entire performance. Digging through these, seeing what makes them tick can be very valuable.... experiment, change things, doesn&#39;t matter if you break it...

Axoloti Community : you are already here :)   ... but you can also select from the help menu in Axoloti. In particular checkout the user guide category.

Object Help : many objects have help a patch which shows you how to use the object, and that can also be run. Also, parts of the help-patch can be copied and used in your own patches. Just right click on an object and select help. (you can also browse the object help from the Help menu on the main axoloti window) 

If you come across any other videos or webpages which show interesting patching ideas or how to&#39;s for Axoloti,
please share them here.
