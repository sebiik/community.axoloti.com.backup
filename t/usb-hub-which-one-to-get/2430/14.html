Just bought my third Axoloti and I think I need to get a USB hub to power them. I just want to be able to connect all three to the same USB port on the computer and power them from there.

        <p>Axoloti does not support hosting usb hubs.<br>and being connected to one is fine, as the device does not 'see it' - I connect my axoloti's to an MTT hub without issue.</p>

<p>MTT is only really important if you have multiple 1.x USB devices that have high bandwidth requirement, e.g audio interfaces, which a single TT would struggle to serve.</p>

<p>if you just connecting a bunch of axoloti, i doubt a single TT hub would be an issue.. this would only change if axoloti ever had usb audio (not planned) or you had another audio interface connected to the same hub.</p>

<p>yes I been to that page too. I just think it is a lot to do to check if it is multi tt. Anyway I think I found 3-4 contestant that I'll try out form online shops. I tried two from local shops, but they both didnt really work very well, disconneting all the time. I am thinking it maybe disconnects the second board cause it doesnt get power enough, which the MTT should fix. From what I have read I understand that a regular usb hub only send out a certain amount of power shared between all of the ports. Where a MTT sends the power that regular one send to all ports, to every single port. So it should make a difference.</p>

<p>I think the Elektron one is best choice but also pretty expensive by 69 euro! But hey, if it works, it works <img src="../../../images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile30f4.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  </p>

<p>Oh, no I am just trying to power the Axolotis and also use the editor. The hub will only be used for Axolotis, so all devices connected are same speed. I am not using the usb hub on the second usb port for connecting multiple controllers. </p>

<p>I have now tried 2 and both failed anf they werent MTT. So now ill go for one that is.</p>

<p>Have you checked the power supply that came with the hub you tested? Sometimes these are way to weak for powering multiple devices. Theoretically if the power supply gives enough each port should give 500mah, wich is more than enough for powering an axoloti. So for 3 it would be save to use a power supply with at least 1,5A I think.</p>

        <p>That's interesting - I use the exact same hub for my (single) Axo, with no problems. I also have a mouse and keyboard connected to the hub, and occasionally an external HD.</p>

<p>One Axo was better than 2 axos. Using 1 Axoloti also disconnected more often than when connected straight to usb port. </p>

<p>When I connect 2, the first one goes live pretty often, but the second one rarely goes live. I would actually go to the extend to say It only goes live one time after connection. So it is not so good.</p>

        <p>I have an Asus VivoBook Pro N552VX (Intel i7) with Windows 10 Pro 64-bit. But I also used the same hub on my previous laptop, a Macbook Air 2014. On both computers (with the current firmware and patcher versions), I've only experienced disconnects when using SD-card reader mode.</p>

<p>Just bought a third usb hub that is supposed to be multi TT. This one <a class="mention" href="../../../users/blindsmyth.html">@Blindsmyth</a> suggested:<br><a href="https://www.conrad.de/de/7-port-usb-20-hub-einzeln-schaltbar-mit-status-leds-schwarz-976193.html" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://www.conrad.de/de/7-port-usb-20-hub-einzeln-schaltbar-mit-status-leds-schwarz-976193.html</a></p>

<p>It still disconnects the second board, so I guess multi TT didnt do much of a difference. <a class="mention" href="../../../users/blindsmyth.html">@Blindsmyth</a> are you using your usb hub for multiple Axolotis?</p>

<p>I am thinking it must be the power then. I found this usb hub , which is multi TT AND has got external power supply. Going to get that next. Hopefully this will be the final one, if not I am not sure where to go next. I'd like to see which exact models others use. Some links would be great.</p>

        <p>Im surprised your having issues, Id have thought any hub with power (as johannes said, check its power rating is 2A +) ,  Ive use 3 different ones with no issues at all.<br>also bare in mind , if/when you start plugging usb devices into the axoloti, they will also mean power requirements increase.</p>

<p>this I confirmed was MTT by checking the chipset it uses, which is about the only way your going to know for sure if its MTT or not.<br>(though as I mentioned before, MTT is unnecessary for axoloti for now... the reason I use it, is I have other USB devices which much higher throughput requirements)</p>

<p>EDIT: btw, on one of my hubs (not this one) , Id did find that one of the ports didn't receive full power. (not  an issue for axoloti, but was for another controller I was using)</p>

<p>Yeah me too. I have only connected 2 Axos and one connects and the second one connects very rarely. Actually with the latest hub I bought, second Axoloti have not connected yet.</p>

<p>Thank you for the link. Will consider that one. But first I think I am going to try what blindsmyth suggest; to use an external power supply for the latest one. </p>

        <p>Ok tested the new one with a power supply and it is still the same. I might add it is only 4.5v and 1.4 ampers I think it says It can change output and I tried going up to 6v instead of 4.5v, that didnt work at all. But at 4,5v, first one connects most of the time and the second one rarely.</p>

<p>I then tested with simple patches and advanced patches. It connects more often with simple patches than with advanced patches. Does Axoloti use more power when loading an advanced patch, using more Dsp?</p>

<p>I want to add that while trouble shooting I compare it to just using the macbooks own two USB inputs. Everytime I connect them there they work every single time. So I am pretty sure there is nothing wrong with the patches or the Axos nor how I am setting it up.... </p>

<p>But really need that third usb port for it. </p>

<p><a class="mention" href="../../../users/thetechnobear.html">@thetechnobear</a><br>Did you get the usb3 or usb2 version of the hub? <br>I might go for the one you suggest then, hopefully it will work for me too. It doesnt really matter so much that it doesnt work for this, cause I needed one for another computer anyway, so Ill just keep it for that and try a fourth Axoloti.</p>

        <p>I got the USB 2 version, as when I was looking the USB 3 didnt have the MTT chipset (this may have changed, Ive had it for quite a while) </p>

<p>I just tested it with 3 axoloti again, just to make sure - didnt want you going on a wild goose chase <img src="../../../images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile30f4.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>anyway, one thing interesting... I forgot initially to turn on the power supply, and its running off my iMac.<br>and the 3 axoloti all worked (running tybett patch). though they did report low voltage (a bit over 4v) <br>then when I turned on the power supply, that they went up to the normal 5v. (as expected) </p>

<p>what voltage are your axolotis reporting? this is the easy way to see if your getting enough juice or not.</p>

<p>Thanks man, I appreciate it. But I guess there can be differences in computer chipsets and so on that might play a role. Don't worry I won't hold you accountable if it doesn't work, hehe <img src="../../../images/emoji/emoji_one/wink30f4.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> </p>

<p>One reports:<br>5v: 4.69v<br>VDD: 3.29</p>

<p>Second reports:<br>5v: 4.83v<br>VDD: 3.30v</p>

<p>So it might be a bit too little voltage.</p>

        <p>no the voltages seem good...</p>

<p>if I have my hub 'unpowered'  with 1 axoloti I'm at 4.30v, and with 3 axoloti I'm down to 4.13v.<br>sure they are reported in 'red' as being under voltage, but still were running patches ok.<br>one small caveat here, I'm not pluginng headphones, or line out or any devices into them, that might increase load more.</p>

<p>(small note: Im not suggesting axolotis should be run under voltage, I merely forgot to turn on my power to my hub, Im not sure what negative side effects running on low voltages might have!)</p>

<p>when you connect your 3rd, can you still see the voltage on at least one of them? (Im assuming each should report 'similar' voltages)</p>

<p>I dont really understand it then. It should be enough power then. i have outputs connected and one of them also has got the modular thing add on board. FOrgot to mention that earlier. Does that play a role? Will check with the 2 clean boards I have with no add ons.</p>

<p>Also I think Ill write an email to Elektron and ask them about their hub. To get more specific detials than their webside gives.</p>

        <p>Well what do ya know. </p>

<p>I now tried with 2 Axos with NO Axocontrol fitted to it. Now I could load advanced patches on BOTH boards and the stay connected. Seems the opposite of your experience <a class="mention" href="../../../users/thetechnobear.html">@thetechnobear</a> . Need to do some more testing before celebrating too much.... But it is a start <img src="../../../images/emoji/emoji_one/wink30f4.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  </p>

<p>I have connected the Axo with the add on board to its own usb channel and the two bare boards to the hub and all works for now. To be honest my Axo add on board is not the finest solder job ever made. Was my first DIY project, so maybe there are some mistakes that have an unwanted effect in some way. But now it works <img src="../../../images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile30f4.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I still have some disconnects but I can use them all at once <img src="../../../images/emoji/emoji_one/wink30f4.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> </p>

<p>The 2 bare board give this info when both are connecte to the hub:<br>5v: 4.81<br>VDD: 3.30</p>

<p>5v: 4.75<br>VDD: 3.30</p>

<p>About the same as the first readings I posted.</p>
