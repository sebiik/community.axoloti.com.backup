        <p>I have no specific brand/model recommendation.</p>

<p>But I suggest getting one with an external power supply, a suitable 4-port hub power supply should be rated 5V at 2A minimum. <br>Because, without external power supply, a 4-port hub can only provide 100mA per port.</p>

<p>The other feature you may look for in a hub is "Multi TT", but this is not critical.</p>

        <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a></p>

<p>I went out and bought one today and that was no succes. 7 port with external power supply. The Axoloti boards connects only sometimes, very rarely, and doesnt seem like a very stabile hub in general. As soon as I connect them directly to computer they connect as always so it is definatly the hub. It was a budget version, like 25-30 euro. I think I better spend a bit more to get a better one. </p>

<p>The one that can <strong>NOT</strong> be recommended is this one:</p>

        <p>I'm using this very cheap 4 port logilink usb hub, wich I don't use for Ableton based up setups anymore because it lacks Multi TT. <br><a href="https://www.reichelt.de/?ARTICLE=139191&amp;PROVID=2788&amp;wt_mc=amc141526782519998&amp;gclid=CjwKEAjw-abABRDquOTJi8qdojwSJABt1S1OeNdZaC0M-Cjke9kDZMHjxCY1NOs5ZoiRjRcDi6g1WRoCo7jw_wcB" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.reichelt.de/?ARTICLE=139191&amp;PROVID=2788&amp;wt_mc=amc141526782519998&amp;gclid=CjwKEAjw-abABRDquOTJi8qdojwSJABt1S1OeNdZaC0M-Cjke9kDZMHjxCY1NOs5ZoiRjRcDi6g1WRoCo7jw_wcB</a><br>works perfectely with 2 Axoloits so far. I even use it without a power supply, although it has the option to use one.</p>

<p>For my liveset I have this one now:<br><a href="https://www.conrad.de/de/7-port-usb-20-hub-einzeln-schaltbar-mit-status-leds-schwarz-976193.html" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.conrad.de/de/7-port-usb-20-hub-einzeln-schaltbar-mit-status-leds-schwarz-976193.html</a><br>has multi TT and the nice thing is it has on and offs for each port, really handy for resetting devices without unplugging.</p>

<p>With Usb hubs its really hard to grasp weither they are reliably or not, and this is not always dependant on price. I would advice you to buy a couple of different ones in all price ranges, and keep the one that worked the best.<br>Also if you only want to hook up 3 Axos a 4 port hub is maybe enough. Ive heard that the less ports, the more reliable...</p>

        <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="/users/blindsmyth">@Blindsmyth</a></p>

<p>Thank you for the detailed info. </p>

<p>I just tried a second one with same result as first one. The second board disconnects a lot too, in general not very stable for use with Axoloti. Also <strong>NOT</strong> recommended:<br><a href="http://www.elgiganten.dk/product/pc-tablets/andet-computertilbehor/L4HUB14/logik-4-port-usb-2-0-hub" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://www.elgiganten.dk/product/pc-tablets/andet-computertilbehor/L4HUB14/logik-4-port-usb-2-0-hub</a></p>

<p>I guess I have to be patient for this and try a few other options before deciding. FInding one with multi TT in my city, doesnt seem so easy. I guess I need to get it of the internet then.</p>

<p>BTW, which operating system are you using? I am on Yosemite using Axo 1.0.11.</p>

        <p>Just fell over this usb hub from Electron. It has got multi TT and external power supply. Pretty much everything I am looking for.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.elektron.se/accessories/overhub/" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://www.elektron.se/accessories/overhub/</a></p>

<p>I have a lof of faith in Electron, they make very good products. I think this might be a good solution. I think Ill try a few more, that I can get locally before I order this one, since it is almost the same price as an axoloti!</p>

<p>Was wondering how you know that the 7-port usb hub you send link for is multi TT? I cannot seem to find any info about it anywhere on th epage. Generally this multi tt is a bit fo mystery and seems like most computer stores I contacted has got no clue what it is.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/blindsmyth">@Blindsmyth</a></p>
<p>Was wondering how you know that the 7-port usb hub you send link for is multi TT? I cannot seem to find any info about it anywhere on th epage. Generally this multi tt is a bit fo mystery and seems like most computer stores I contacted has got no clue what it is.</p>
</blockquote></aside>

<p>Multi TT is important when you use older USB 1.1 devices together with Usb 2.0 devices. It was important to me because I've been using older Midi controllers together with newer ones. Multi TT is not included in many newer hubs and not many people know about because USB 1.1 devices are just really uncommon these days. Thats also why its not included in the specs. On mac you can check if you hub is single or multi tt according to this description. <a href="http://www.cypress.com/knowledge-base-article/how-check-whether-usb-20-hub-multi-tt-or-single-tt-kba93279" rel="nofollow">http://www.cypress.com/knowledge-base-article/how-check-whether-usb-20-hub-multi-tt-or-single-tt-kba93279</a><br>go to over this mac and to the system overview and then to Usb devices.</p>

<p>But I think for multiple Axolotis you might not even need Multi TT. <a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> any Ideas? </p>

<p>This elektron hub might be an Idea because its made for musical purposes, meaning high speed and good reliabiltiy. Another thing I've been thinking of is trying out a thunderbolt to usb hub, since the thunderbolt port is suppossed to be superfast. This would leave 2 usb ports without a hub.</p>

        <p>Axoloti does not support hosting usb hubs.<br>and being connected to one is fine, as the device does not 'see it' - I connect my axoloti's to an MTT hub without issue.</p>

<p>MTT is only really important if you have multiple 1.x USB devices that have high bandwidth requirement, e.g audio interfaces, which a single TT would struggle to serve.</p>

<p>if you just connecting a bunch of axoloti, i doubt a single TT hub would be an issue.. this would only change if axoloti ever had usb audio (not planned) or you had another audio interface connected to the same hub.</p>

<p>yes I been to that page too. I just think it is a lot to do to check if it is multi tt. Anyway I think I found 3-4 contestant that I'll try out form online shops. I tried two from local shops, but they both didnt really work very well, disconneting all the time. I am thinking it maybe disconnects the second board cause it doesnt get power enough, which the MTT should fix. From what I have read I understand that a regular usb hub only send out a certain amount of power shared between all of the ports. Where a MTT sends the power that regular one send to all ports, to every single port. So it should make a difference.</p>

<p>I think the Elektron one is best choice but also pretty expensive by 69 euro! But hey, if it works, it works <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  </p>

<p>Oh, no I am just trying to power the Axolotis and also use the editor. The hub will only be used for Axolotis, so all devices connected are same speed. I am not using the usb hub on the second usb port for connecting multiple controllers. </p>

<p>I have now tried 2 and both failed anf they werent MTT. So now ill go for one that is.</p>

<p>Have you checked the power supply that came with the hub you tested? Sometimes these are way to weak for powering multiple devices. Theoretically if the power supply gives enough each port should give 500mah, wich is more than enough for powering an axoloti. So for 3 it would be save to use a power supply with at least 1,5A I think.</p>

<p>One Axo was better than 2 axos. Using 1 Axoloti also disconnected more often than when connected straight to usb port. </p>

<p>When I connect 2, the first one goes live pretty often, but the second one rarely goes live. I would actually go to the extend to say It only goes live one time after connection. So it is not so good.</p>

        <p>I have an Asus VivoBook Pro N552VX (Intel i7) with Windows 10 Pro 64-bit. But I also used the same hub on my previous laptop, a Macbook Air 2014. On both computers (with the current firmware and patcher versions), I've only experienced disconnects when using SD-card reader mode.</p>

<p>Just bought a third usb hub that is supposed to be multi TT. This one <a class="mention" href="/users/blindsmyth">@Blindsmyth</a> suggested:<br><a href="https://www.conrad.de/de/7-port-usb-20-hub-einzeln-schaltbar-mit-status-leds-schwarz-976193.html" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://www.conrad.de/de/7-port-usb-20-hub-einzeln-schaltbar-mit-status-leds-schwarz-976193.html</a></p>

<p>It still disconnects the second board, so I guess multi TT didnt do much of a difference. <a class="mention" href="/users/blindsmyth">@Blindsmyth</a> are you using your usb hub for multiple Axolotis?</p>

<p>I am thinking it must be the power then. I found this usb hub , which is multi TT AND has got external power supply. Going to get that next. Hopefully this will be the final one, if not I am not sure where to go next. I'd like to see which exact models others use. Some links would be great.</p>

        <p>Im surprised your having issues, Id have thought any hub with power (as johannes said, check its power rating is 2A +) ,  Ive use 3 different ones with no issues at all.<br>also bare in mind , if/when you start plugging usb devices into the axoloti, they will also mean power requirements increase.</p>

<p>this I confirmed was MTT by checking the chipset it uses, which is about the only way your going to know for sure if its MTT or not.<br>(though as I mentioned before, MTT is unnecessary for axoloti for now... the reason I use it, is I have other USB devices which much higher throughput requirements)</p>

<p>EDIT: btw, on one of my hubs (not this one) , Id did find that one of the ports didn't receive full power. (not  an issue for axoloti, but was for another controller I was using)</p>

<p>As said the external power thing is crucial, since 3 Axoloti could draw more than the 500mah your computer gives the hub.</p>

<blockquote><p>Im surprised your having issues, Id have thought any hub with power (as johannes said, check its power rating is 2A +) ,  Ive use 3 different ones with no issues at all.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>Yeah me too. I have only connected 2 Axos and one connects and the second one connects very rarely. Actually with the latest hub I bought, second Axoloti have not connected yet.</p>

<p>Thank you for the link. Will consider that one. But first I think I am going to try what blindsmyth suggest; to use an external power supply for the latest one. </p>

<p>Ahhh, Yes I see the input. Will try to find one in the closet of lost power supplies. I probably all ready have one that will work. </p>
