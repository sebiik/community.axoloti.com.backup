    <description>Hey

Have been trying to record a LFO output signal to a table and then play it back. But I havent been succesful in making the table play it back right. I just dont know what I should use to &quot;drive&quot; the table play object. I tried with square lfo, constants, other lfos, etc. but it doesnt play the movement back in the way it is before it is recorded to table.

Any ideas? Thanks ;)

    Hi I'm looking into making a simple midi rec looper gate sequencer running over 2 bars. fonctions would be really basic: midi sync from DIN input Rec on via midi switch on/off Erase real time via midi switch held during playback. recording of gate events (no different midi notes) recording of 2 or three midi parameters continuously via knobs. Anyone has some intel regarding this. 

I would start here   <a href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c59ebc42872f01106e5a65e563a519f26d4734b8.png" class="lightbox" title="Capture d’écran 2019-05-04 à 19.47.20.png" rel="nofollow noopener">[image]</a>

<p>but it seems to me the object by <a class="mention" href="/u/thetechnobear">@thetechnobear</a> is a good way of doing it.<br>I'm having hard time understanding the playback though.<br>I made this patch and it doesn't seem to playback recorded events.<br>I'm a bit stucked.</p>

<blockquote><p>Still no idea why you think an LFO is necessary.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>Well at first there was a toogle connected to the gate input it didnt record here. Then I tried with a sq lfo and that worked...I probably did something wrong to start with... So I just continued using an lfo. Maybe I'll try without again. </p>

<p>EDIT just tried again and it still doesnt record when the toggle is connected to the gate input. Atleast I am not sure how it should react. I am looking for recording something and then loop it in sync with some other sequencers. And for this connecting an lfo to gate works well. </p>

<p>I also tried with midi clock and that also works. </p>

<p>THough I might add It had crashed Axoloti software a few times here.</p>

<p>Yes it only records when recording is turned on.</p>

<p>That is why I connected the "end"  of the loop object to the "Rst in" on the square lfo  that I use for the gate input . Cause then the recorder will restart everytime it reaches the end of the "up" and starts over. If you use lfos as clock this works pretty good.</p>

<blockquote><p>Yeah or some LFOs that is syncable to ppq. That could solve the sync to clock problem.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>why would you not just use  24ppqn (or 6)  output from a clock to trigger the reset , and therefore you will be in sync?  </p>

<p>the 24ppqn output is a simple sync'd counter, so as I did on another thread you can divide this, and then run into another counter, so you can get bars/beats, or what ever divisions you want, <br>using this you could then have a control which forced the modulation to loop every 4 bars (or whatever)</p>

<p>if you want modulations in sync, which is not really what this was designed for... which was more 'live performance', then that is a different thing, thats about quantising... could easily be added to this object (its simply a matter of 'quantising the clock') but you can also quantise externally to the object (either on input or output, depending on your needs really)</p>

<p>the trick with all these things, is not to try to get one component to do everything, rather to give it the inputs that allow other things to drive it.</p>

<p>again on another thread, I said, I think we could do with a clock thats a bit more a musically oriented (rather than time/samples) , with tempo input, and bar/beat outputs... i think if it has external inputs (for midi sync, and perhaps tempo 'detection') , it probably would be close to what most people 'expect' to find and have been attempting to do with existing objects (which is possible) <br>its trivial to write, just a matter of finding the time to get around to writing it <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

              <p>actually I mean the version number shown in the GUI. (Help / About) , latest is 1.03<br>but I always run a dev build (and its moved on a reasonable amount since 1.03) , so it could be Ive got changes not released yet... which is why I was interested if Jaffa (who had it running) was running the release build or not.</p>

<p>as I said, I really suspect its relying on a fix thats was added a while ago for tables... as its doing a very similar thing.</p>

<p>unfortunately there are no 'pre-releases' for windows, so you may have to wait for the next release, which I hope wont be too long now.</p>

<p>To me it looks like your probably not running the latest version of the firmware etc, as I think the poly index stuff was changed to fix tables which had a similar issue. </p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/jaffasplaffa">@jaffasplaffa</a> as you have it working, are you running the dev version or 1.03 ?<br>( it's possible it only works on dev version, no worries there will hopefully be a new release soon )</p>

<p>Note: for record mode-  end is set, when it gets to the buffer end OR you take the gate low. For play - end is set when it reached end of recording (not buffer!) or you take gate low.  </p>

<p>Reset, just starts from beginning... I don't think I tested for record, but I'd probably say it should start from beginning <br>Note: you need to reset after both record or play, their is no implicit reset, the idea being you could 'pause' play or record and then continue.  </p>

<p>That's what I'd expect at least....<br>The only undefined state ( ok it's not undefined, more perhaps not intuitive) , is switching modes - I only really tested switching modes then doing stop, mode switch , reset then start. <br>I'd have to think what the correct behavior is for this, depending if running or not. I think probably it should do an implicit reset, and keep running mode as is.</p>

<p>As i mentioned the looping/running is intentionally under user control, as often this will want to be sync'd to a master clock etc.</p>

              <p>Finally had time to test it. It works very well. Huge thanks, <a class="mention" href="/users/thetechnobear">@thetechnobear</a>. Didnt expect custom object <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> Cool. yeah, it probably cosumes less DSP than making it from many objects.</p>

<p>I connected a square LFO to the gate input AND connected end from automate object to the square LFO reset. Then you have a continuos recorder. If I dont connect the end to square LFO reset in, it only records and plays back when the square is up(or down, sorry dont remeber right now, but it is either up or down that records). And also set buffer of automate object to 128.</p>

<p><a class="attachment" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/1X/ecc18267d97e487d8be1fb151c7f4d07af4566a2.axo">autoseq.axo</a> (5.2 KB) (v0.1)<br><a class="attachment" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/1X/bbe43c33cc55d5eda3d0d670083186a8888bcb65.axp">autotest.axp</a> (2.6 KB)</p>

<p>ok, i 'cheated' a bit... I created an axo object to do the work, basically because when things are a little more complicated, its easier <strong>for me</strong> to write it in C, and frankly its more efficient to do it like this <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> <br>(I'm pretty sure you could do it with existing objects if you wished)</p>

<p>to use: <br>size is the max number of events to record.<br>it is also limited to running for 16.5 days, to extend this we would have to introduce quantising... or extend the counter.<br>on the positive side, event play/record should be accurate to 1/3000 sec. </p>

<p>you have a play or record mode, and a gate (like a transport in a daw i.e active = running) . then just send it values when recording. (I've put logging in so you can see what its doing , this would come out for 'real' use)<br>outputs v is the value (it echoes during record, which make it easy to connect) and end indicates when the last event is reached.<br>the idea is to loop you could use 'end' to trigger reset... but of course that might not be immediate but at the start of a bar etc.</p>

<p>evt is event number (not really useful) , and clk is clock... the later would be useful when using multiple automate objects, which could then share a common clock ... basically id add clock input, and internal/external clock flag.<br>(they will sync already, as its based on k-rate,but using a common/external clock would mean we could do fun things like shift time forwards and backwards)</p>

<p>if you look in the axo, and ignore the logic around starting/stopping etc, you will see it does as i said, uses 2 arrays one to store time the other the value. its really very simple</p>

<p>I didnt have much time, but as far as i could tell its working correctly.</p>

<p>when I get some more time, I'll finish it off, <br>in particular, id probably make it so switch between play/record, automatically reset ... i.e. so you can keep the clock running. add the int/ext clock and clk input.  (and remove logging <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> ) ... I might also add some kind of quantising function, as its quite fun as a note recorder.</p>

<p>let me know if it kind of does what you expected.</p>

<p>EDIT: oops forgot to update uuid/sha... new version added.</p>

<p>wrong, since you usually will record less values for any time T, you can use a smaller table.<br>also, your approach of dividing the time, essentially quantises events... fine if thats what you want, but is not usually what you want for automation.</p>

<p>anyway, it was an alternative, for consideration... some cases its useful, others not. <br>(I thought by describing the implementation, its reasonably clear where the boundaries of conditions are of usefulness are)</p>

              <p>Sounds like an awesome idea recording time and value. The goal is to be able to use a midi controller and then record knob modulation into a table and play it back. I could use a lfo and just turn it on and off, but the ability to record knob modulations makes it a bit more fun and more hands on approach <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>I thik I need to read this a few times before it makes 100% sense to me.</p>

<blockquote><p>note: with tables (rather than a more complex data structure) you can only do overwriting overdub, you can't do any inserting, as there are (currently) no functions on the tables to insert data, and so move existing events</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>To me it is ok just to be able to record it and if it is not good enough I can just record a new version. No need to make overdubs.</p>

<blockquote><p>EDIT: I've noticed your talking about recording an LFO, I assume this is because a user is changing it... as recording anything that is constant has no purpose... in which case Id still record 'the events' not the output... i.e. the pitch changes a user is making.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>As I described in the beginning of this post I am aiming for recording modulation send from my midicontroller. I used the lfo as an example mimicking knob modulations. You know for example using a midi controller to control a filter in Axoloti and the record the control movement into a table. On Kaos pad 3 it is called "Pad motion". It is almost the same. You turn on a switch and you can touch the pad and record any movement into the KP3 and play it back. But in kp3 it is not in sync. </p>

<p>Sync:<br>I am trying to figure out how to make a relay/switch system that when you turn record on, it waits with actually recording until next bar starts... and then turns of again after 2 bars(or whatever length you set). So the recording is in sync all the time..... Still thinking about how to make this. I have tried to make one version but didnt succed yet. Need to try a few times I think. But then next step would be how to play those 2 bars back again, ALSO in sync.... Maybe technobears approach will work for this. Would really like to see an example, cause I am not 100% sure how to make it.</p>

<p>Anyway. using the 24ppq clock seems to work just fine and allows a long recording in a table of size 512 . Use a k-rate filter (after) the table to smooth the signal to avoid audible 'steps'.   (having a 384ppq or 768ppq clock would be nice though.)</p>
