    <description>hi there,

i think it would be very nice to have a toggle switch also in the attributes section of the objects. i have coded an object that creates a binary file and writes data to it. depending on a switch (here i would love the toggle) it either overwrites/creates the file or appends data to the end. right now i am using a spinner with a max value of 1 which works but is a bit ugly and not very obvious for the user.</description>
