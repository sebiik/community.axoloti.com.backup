    <title>Why can&#39;t ctrl/* objects be patchable as well as midi cc assigned by default?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/why-cant-ctrl-objects-be-patchable-as-well-as-midi-cc-assigned-by-default/1974</link>
    <description>Hello, I&#39;m new to Axoloti so I&#39;m a little bit confused as to why the default control objects like the dials, selectors and other objects do not have a a patchable inlet as well as being assignable to a MIDI CC value. This seems to make it very difficult to treat Axoloti patches like a modular system, or being able to use buttons and dials connected to the GPIO of the Axoloti easily.

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/f/fab2f12de6348b8886b217deb5f4d519a05c8fd9.jpg&quot; width=&quot;384&quot; height=&quot;256&quot;&gt;

Disclaimer, I have the Music Thing Modular shield for my Axoloti, so I have buttons and dials I&#39;d like to mapped to patches I didn&#39;t necessarily make, and It seems weird to create a setup that would have a GPIO -&gt; Midi OUT -&gt; Midi In -&gt; Assigned CC, which is the only workaround I can think of.

Let me know if I&#39;m missing something, since I&#39;ve only been playing with my Axoloti for a couple of days now.</description>

              <p>Ive discussed this with <a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a>, and we  are going to actually review this when we change parameters. we are hoping to make it such that all parameters will also appear as an inlet (not just ctrl/*).</p>

<p>this will have the added benefit of reduce the number of objects we have (due to variations with mod inputs and without)  ... but not a simple/small task.  so not before we stabilise the 1.0.10 release.</p>

              <p>Got it. I guess I'm wondering why versions <strong>without</strong> patchable inputs exist at all.</p>

<p>Since it means that one would have to extensively rewrite community provided patches. Why not make sure that, as a standard, all parameters can be patched with both CV style inputs or MIDI CC inputs?</p>

<p>I guess the solution for now is to create a "controller" that maps all of the buttons and dials of the Music Thing Modular Axo-Control and other boards with GPIO to Midi CC first, then use the assign Midi CC channel feature instead of trying to wire things in directly.</p>

              <p>I believe right-click on the dial will allow to assign a CC number. I'm not sure what you want with the inlet but you can for example use a + object to sum the dial and another source, if that's what you are looking for.</p>
