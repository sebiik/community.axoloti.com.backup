<blockquote><p>I have no time for politically correct language policing thanks.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>It is not hard to talk nicely to each other. There is really no need to put other products down saying it is a toy. Especially since you have not even tried it. Does that make sense to you? So yeah I think, yes,  you are totally wrong in your statement. And saying stuff like that without even trying it... Sorry doesnt do anything good for your credibility. Yeah you CAN say what you want...... But you can STILL be hold accountable to what you say. And there is no need to put other people down or to be rude or stuff like that. It is funny, or actually not funny at all, this started to become more of a problem lately in this group as more and more people enter the group.</p>

<p>And sorry you were complaining about something: And I agreed with you.. And then you turn 180 degrees around and attack me for saying the same things you said.... NICE!!!!! And on top of that you were putting Organelle down, saying it was a toy. And you don't know, cause you have not tried it, you said yourself. I have. So yeah I stand by my statement that I think you are doing the same thing. </p>

<p>But the thing is.... You are NOT right....... at all......... You are talking about things you dont know anything about.. So please...... Think before you post.

        <p>And by the way the remark about rather being right rather than popular was meant generally not in reference to Organelle.</p>

<p>I do think much of this could have been avoided if your English comprehension was a bit better, it's not your first language is it?</p>

<p>If you read my comments you will see I admitted I didn't know what Organelle sounded like in comparison to Axo but there were also other reasons I wouldn't get one.</p>

<p>Don't you think you are over reacting somewhat?</p>

        <p>I made a post last night with a link to a piece of generative stuff i had done on axo using some subpatches I'm building up to make music by rules and randomness.</p>

<p>I'd welcome comments and suggestions and I've got plenty of unresolved issues and questions that have come up in trying to do what I'm doing, I'd appreciate any input you have to offer.</p>

<p>The track i posted is just meant to demonstrate where I'm going with it and the sounds and mix are not at all polished, it's about the notes and rhythm at this point.</p>

<p>Let's take the conversation to that thread or the thread I started on generative music generally.</p>

<p>Yes you are right, but does it matter? Don't you understand what I write? As I said attacking people gramma is totally low ball. I actually just gave you an advice on your patch but I deleted it again after reading this. Not going to offer you any kind of support in the future.</p>

<p>The personal attack that you made was, that I said organelle was better than axo in many areas. And you said yourself that when you said something with axoloti that could be better, maybe criticising a bit, you felt that people attacked you.. And then when I did that, said that Organelle was better in som areas, you started saying weird things and attacking the facts about the 2 devices. </p>

<p>And you said Organelle was not more powerful than Axo, but based on some point that don't make sense &gt; you said sample rate and bit rate made Organelle worse than Axoloti. And that statement it off. And also calling it a toy is totally off. And may i add again that you said that you have not even tried it? So you attacked me for stating the obvious, that organelle has more processing power than Axo, doing the same thing that I actually agreed with you on.</p>

        <p><a class="mention" href="/u/strum">@strum</a><br>I understand your attitude regards free speech (let's just say I'm extremely protective of that myself), but you're pushing people's patience when you totally disregard what you're actually saying.  That's kinda why I replied to you in the other thread, I was being sarcastic cause you came here, suggested we could ignore the lead developer and go our own way.  Seriously, you must surely realise why saying something like that is gonna come across as extremely 'crude' to the members here.</p>

<p>You're exactly the sort of person we need here on a technical level, and you even responded to my own humour like a good sport (and I respect you for that cause that's a good thing).  But your community skills are guaranteed to be taken even worse than mine when you say stuff like that.</p>

<p>Regards the Organelle thing, same here, I see it as an overpriced toy which is why I don't own one.  By "toy" I'm referring to the tiny keyboard, not it's capabilities.  In a way, Organelle is a good thing in that it proves Open Source need not mean lack of profits.  Mark hit the nail bang on the head when he pointed out Organelle being a self-contained but customisable finished product is what's attracting people to it.</p>

<p>This is an area I know a lot about, and I can tell you, he is right, that's why it's popular, but would I buy one?</p>

<p>No, because it's way overpriced on a BOM level.</p>

<p>I don't hate them for it though, because they, like a few other Open Hardware based projects out there, are proving that Open Hardware is every bit as profitable as proprietary (if not more so).  And anything that destroys 'proprietory' anything is most welcome in my book.  So really it's understandable people love the Organelle, it's <em>because</em> the creator got something critical right, that they're able to charge a premuim for it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok, so we got another one in the group who wants to take EVERY discussion to the extreme. Great stuff......</p>
<p>You are wrong mr. Accept it and move on.</p>
</blockquote></aside>

<p>I saw what you wrote there, Jaffa, and just so you know, while I don't agree with the way strum said certain things, he was perfectly correct in that he should be allowed to refer to the Organelle as a toy if he wishes.  He is also correct that the people with a problem are those who cannot accept other people's opinions.  If strum calls it a toy, so what.  I call it a toy too, cause to me that's what it is, certainly compared to Axo it is anyway!</p>

<p>You're a good guy, Jaffa, you mean well, but just like Mark you need to understand that lately, this whole politically correct thing is getting way out of hand.  It's to the stage where poeple are so used to being surrounded by it, hearing other people practice it, day in, day out, that they do not realise they're practicing it themselves.  This is exactly what governments want, they want everyone reacting like you do, because every time you do it, you're contributing to, and helping, the forces (govenments) that are trying to crush our freedom of speech and our right to it.</p>

<p><strong>STOP!</strong></p>

<p>Now take a deep breath and you'll see that actually, it is <em><strong>you</strong></em> who has a problem.  If you cannot handle the fact that someone refers to a certain device as a toy then you have greater issues than you're even aware of.  You shouldn't be getting upset over such completely harmless comments.  Organelle is a toy to some, and not to others. So what!  And either way, either groups are entitled to point out their own take on it.</p>

<p>I said it before and I'll say it again, the effect government and media brainwashing has had on people regards political correctness in recent years, is truly mindblowing, and this discussion right here is a perfect example of it.  There is little wonder strum called you pathetic and told you to STFU etc.</p>

<p>So, not taking sides here, just pointing out the obvious.  Mark is doing his job as a mod, so he's not exactly in an ideal position to please everyone.  Trouble is, he's taking the politically correct approach, and we live in a world where political correctness is <em><strong>finally</strong></em> about to get it's skull crushed cause people are fed-up of it.  "Political correctness" needs to be seen for what it is, that being "Political Manipulation", and therefore, needs to be destroyed, not embraced.</p>

<p>In years to come people will look back at conversations such as these and laugh themselves silly.  They'll read stuff like this and say things like <em>"Wow, people were really scared to speak freely back then!".</em></p>

<p>So you want to go into a debate that has absolutely nothing do to with you. I kind of expected it so:</p>

<p>I am not the only one who pointed it out. Did you also miss the yellow sticker my Thetechnobear? Pointing out that there is no need to put down other developers products? No need to regard anything as a toy. Especially from people who have never even been in the same room as an Organelle? It might look a it bit "hipster", that was also my first impression. But it is an absolute beast. And so is Axo, but in each of their own ways.</p>

<p>I dunno why I even bothered answering some of your questions after last debate. So not going to answer any of your posts anymore. It is because people like this I started getting hesitant about what I upload to this side. I really don't want to share anything with people who can't keep focus on a topic and becomes abusive everytime things doesn't go their way</p>

<p>Axoman, it has NOTHING to do with political correctness, which I know you like to take every debate to that level. It has to do with simple and basic decency, being nice to each other. Do you like being called a bitch? Did you see what he wrote... First i told me to "stop being a bitch" and next asked me for help for his patch in a another post he made....... One can only wonder what is going through his mind.... Situational awareness....... I repeat....... Social situational awareness.... Don't talk trash to someone and next ask them for help.... That is just completely loco........ My kids are more mature than that and knows how to behave better. </p>

<p>And again I will suggest the same to Strum as I did to you:</p>

<p><strong>Find an appropriate forum for trash talking, like facebook, Reddit or whatever.</strong></p>

<p> So yeah, you two guys are simply the main reasons why I dont post much here anymore. I really don't want to share my stuff with people who are like that. Who wants to share anything with anyone calling you a bitch? <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>And again we have all ready debated you relationship to "free speech" in here several times. And you clearly dont understand that freedom of speech still comes with a responsibility. And you can stille be hold accountable for what your say even though it is not illegal. And in this case, you stand firm on your right to talk to people in rude manner. That is all right. I reserve my right not to answer your questions nor help you in anyway. And that is the consequence of you having to have absolute free speech. Is it worth calling people a bitch for that?</p>

        <p>No, you're not listening, are you.</p>

<p><em><strong>You</strong></em> are the one with a problem, <em><strong>you</strong></em> are acting immaturely.  <strong><em>You</em></strong> are the one getting out of your pram over someone calling your beloved Organelle a "Toy"!</p>

<p>Grow the fuck up dude!</p>

<p>BTW, you use Facebook?<br>That is <em>highly</em> irresponsible, you have kids, remember?</p>

<p>Wouldn't be surprised if you have one of those Amazon Echos sitting in your house as well.  Completely poinless device that does surveillance of your family, yet people actually <em>buy</em> that shit <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/laughing.png?v=5" title=":laughing:" class="emoji" alt=":laughing:"> <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/laughing.png?v=5" title=":laughing:" class="emoji" alt=":laughing:"> <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/laughing.png?v=5" title=":laughing:" class="emoji" alt=":laughing:"></p>

<p>Talk about irreversible dementia, I mean you'd have to be dumbest of dumb to allow one one of those things anywhere near your family, yet the amount of reviews on Amazon prove that the plan to breed complete imbeciles has worked alarmingly well.  </p>

<p>A problem indeed.</p>

<p>Bottom line is, regards the Organelle thing, the only reason this argument is here is because he wasn't allowed to call it a toy.  It is a toy to some.  It looks like a piece of bent-over tin, with a display so tiny even a mouse might need a magnifying glass to read it.  It's got keys that look like they belong in a nursery, and it only appears to be available in girly pastel colours!</p>

<p>On the other hand, if they'd packaged it in a more sensible way.  Full sized keyboard, bigger display, and sensible colours, more people would likely see it as <em>not</em> a toy at all.  The point is, strum, me, you, Mark, anyone is free to see it and refer to it however we like.</p>

<p>You think it's awesome - cool!<br>Mark thinks it's awsome - cool!<br>Many others think it's awesome - cool!</p>

<p>Strum thinks it's a toy - cool!<br>Axoman thinks it's a toy - cool!<br>Many others think it's a toy - cool!</p>

<p>The <em><strong>problem</strong></em> is when you cannot accept that <em><strong>different people have different opinions</strong></em>, and the only reason you do this is because you're "politically corrected".  Get it into your skull once and for all that humans have different opinions, then these arguments would not start in the first place!</p>

<p>Like I said, I <strong><em>don't</em></strong> agree with the way strum approached this, I thought he was quite rude, but some of the things he said is in his reply is correct.  You <em><strong>are</strong></em> pathetic, because it <em><strong>is</strong></em> pathetic to get defensive over calling a synthesizer a toy!</p>

<p>So what, who cares?</p>

<p>You see all those Volcas?<br>TOYS!</p>

<p>You see all those Monotrons?<br>TOYS!</p>

<p>You see all those Pocket Operators?<br>TOYS!</p>

<p>Yay for TOYS, toys are awesome <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/sunglasses.png?v=5" title=":sunglasses:" class="emoji" alt=":sunglasses:"></p>

And then when I did that, said that Organelle was better in som areas, you started saying weird things and attacking the facts about the 2 devices. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you said Organelle was not more powerful than Axo, but based on some point that don't make sense \u0026gt; you said sample rate and bit rate made Organelle worse than Axoloti. And that statement it off. And also calling it a toy is totally off. And may i add again that you said that you have not even tried it? So you attacked me for stating the obvious, that organelle has more processing power than Axo, doing the same thing that I actually agreed with you on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003caside class=\"quote\" data-post=\"53\" data-topic=\"571\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"title\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"quote-controls\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" src=\"//community.axoloti.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v2/letter/s/8dc957/40.png\" class=\"avatar\"\u003estrum:\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou just said you wanted to talk about Axo, so do it, in one of the threads I suggested, and stop whining like a little bitch here please.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWow, you are really rude.
