    <description>I have no time for politically correct language policing thanks.

Being offended is a choice, I&#39;ll call things toys if I like, people can deal with it how ever they like.

The truth is rarely popular nor are those that speak it.

I&#39;d rather be right than popular and believe free speech is absolute save for calling for violence.

Your inability to handle my opinions is your problem.</description>

              <p>Did you know, Google recently removed the predictive search system from Google search.  They claimed they removed it because of bandwidth.</p>

<p>The real reason they removed it is seriously disturbing.  They removed it because as you typed in <em>"how to ..."</em> the top result was <em>"how to commit suicide"</em>.  They have removed the feature for this reason, they are largely responsible for <em>creating</em> a climate where the top result is <em>"how to commit suicide"</em>, and now the carnage is beginning to show.</p>

<p>This is what happens when people use Google, Facebook, all that social shit.  It removes people from real life and depresses them when they see how other people live compared to themselves.  Young people especially, cannot cope with this, and therefore commit suicide.  And because government have gotten completely out of hand (selling private data etc) people also now have to live with a constant "fear" of things they've said or done while young and foolish, coming back to haunt or disgrace them later in life.</p>

<p>The whole system is <strong>completely monstrous</strong> and <strong>completely immoral</strong> and needs to be dealt with.  So best you tell <em><strong>that</strong></em> to your students, Jaffa, cause filling their heads with fact and not fiction, will work wonders.</p>

<p>Did you know the <strong><em>real</em></strong> reason Google removed that feature?<br>No, you didn't, but you do now, so don't forget to pass it on, will you.</p>

              <p>Speaking of stripping down a laptop, I recommend you avoid the latest Microsoft Surface, which I hear is designed to be impossible to dismantle.  If you were to dismantle it, it would be destroyed (it's been designed that way).  Now I'll leave it to you to guess why it's designed like that, and I'll also leave it to you to guess why the practice of building intentionally irrepairible products is being allowed.  Everyone has the right to dismantle and repair anything they own, because it's their property.</p>

<p>You should also ask yourself why Microsoft was allowed to illegally force Windows 10 down people's throats and get away with it?</p>

<p>You are seriously disturbed. I am starting to think you probably got some serious mental health issues, so now I start to feel sorry for you instead.</p>

<p>Again, you are pushing your disturbing world view on others. In psychology that is called projection &gt; pushing ones own disturbing thoughts onto someone else and make it sound like it is their believe and that is how one raises his kids.

<p>The simple answer to that is NO, and here is the reason why.  If we read the political correctness bullshit posted around the web, and then went somewhere else to debate it, that would allow the political correctness to remain, and would not permit onlookers to see the correct response to political correctness.</p>
<p>Your way of thinking does not work.  There are countless websites about this stuff but the only people who visit them are the people who are already aware of the problem.  Much better to catch people at it, and rectify them ON THE SPOT where the bullshit took place, and eventually, over time, this will contribute to political correctness getting it's ugly head crushed.</p>
</blockquote></aside>

<p>Sorry you are talking so much gibberish. But again you are totally misunderstanding the idea. You keep talking about political correctness. But in a forum like this it has to do with being nice to each other and help each other. When you want to interact with someone, it is just good approach to be nice.</p>

<p>Yes I get it you reserve the right to be rude to anyone at any second of the day. That is what it is about. I dont care about political correctness in this forum, I care about being nice to each other. And then we are back to the fact that evertime there is a debate you have to drag in things from the surrounding world that bothers you and make the debate about that. I get it. You dont know patching. You cant write an object. You seem to be more interested in politics than synthezeiser...... So all left to do is to debate politics....... But the things is... The things you debate..are...not....relevant....to..this.....group.. Why are you actually in this group?</p>

<p>So if you say it is not worth it to be polite to each other you say it is bullshit to be nice and polite. So what is a good way to approach each other? What is the best way to approach someone you want to ask for help or talk to? "hey asshole, please help me?""hey asshole, how are you?" How should we address each other when we approach each other as humans? This is not about political correctness but about being friendly. And you obviously dont know how to do that. </p>

<p>Cause again, the only thing I read form your disturbing world view is that you want to reserve you the right to talk about anything, in any forum, at any time, even though it is not relevant to the forum you want to debate it. </p>

<p>But seriously..... Do you think anyone wants to help you when you talk to people like that and cant keep on topic?</p>

              <p>Sorry about that, just add <em><strong>community.</strong></em> before the URL (and don't forget the dot).</p>

<p>I had to do it like that because this annoying forum software kept posting quotes from the thread I was trying to post a link to.  I'd love to know what software this forum uses cause they've sprang-up all over the web all of a sudden and that's actually quite disturbing.  Everything about the design and the way it works is 'pushy' and 'manipulative' in nature and makes me think one of the tech giants are behind it's design.</p>

<p>All it ever does is treat people like kids, giving them "awards" for such things as making a first post.  Or thanking someone, or whatever.  The design stinks of Apple and Google-like manipulation and mentality, and the data-retention system it uses stinks of NSA involvement.</p>

<p>You can't even talk in private on these forums due to it having a system where anyone in the conversation can invite someone else.  I'm guessing this is an experiment to see how it effects what people say to each other in private discussions.  Private discussions are supposed to be just that, and no one in the discussion should be able to bring anyone else into it.  Having the ability to do that will effect what people would normally say in private. It's a completely immoral concept which, like I said, stinks of Apple or Google, Facebook etc.</p>

<p>I think whoever designed this forum software is a control freak, and completely psychopathic in nature.</p>

              <p>I'd like to clarify my position somewhat here if I may in the hope of putting an end to this .</p>

<p>I had no idea this was going to turn into a shit fight and certainly had not intended to start one.</p>

<p>I had no idea of what happened between Jaffa and Axoman before.</p>

<p>I had not been very active on the forum until recently and have no previous connections with anybody here.</p>

<p>Though I agree with a lot of what Axoman says I am not in any way associated with him or allied with him and I disagree with him on some of the things he has said.</p>

<p>I think that this is not the place for this sort of discussion and did not wish to try and make it a place for that, there are plenty of other places to do that.</p>

<p>I would like to keep my involvement focused on the project and not get involved in anything personal or political here.</p>

<p>If I have offended anyone by expressing my opinions in an undiplomatic way I apologise sincerely, if you have an issue with something I have said please feel free to contact me by private message and I will be happy to have a polite and reasonable discussion with you about it if you can refrain from getting irrational, emotional and abusive. Such behaviour will likely result in treatment in kind.</p>

<p>I will do my best in future to not start this sort of thing again, but I do feel that things need to loosen up here, people need to relax and not be so intolerant of people's differences, can we just focus on the shared interest we have in Axoloti instead please?</p>

<p>I had been aware of the sensitivity of this place since my first involvement here and have actually been self censoring quite a lot because of that already believe it or not.</p>

<p>I think speech on the Axoloti forum should be almost entirely focused on Axoloti and all personal, religious, political, ethnic, gender or other identity class issues kept to the absolute, and I mean ABSOLUTE, minimum necessary.</p>

<p>If you want to talk about those things do it somewhere else or in private.</p>

<p>It think it is a sad and sorry state of affairs that this has been the most active thread on here for the last 3 days and that none of us are working on the project. We all need to take a look at ourselves</p>

<p>I've taken time out from my patching work to make this post but I felt I needed to try and finish what I started.</p>

<p>Again we all need to take a good hard look at ourselves, nobody is immune to the Dunning-Kruger effect, thinking you are is a symptom of it.</p>

<p>I'm am trying to keep my involvement in this storm in a teacup to a minimum so as not to fan the flames and I apologise again for starting it, can we all be the bigger men and drop it?</p>

<p>I don't want to have to reply to this again.</p>

<p>Surely we have plenty of Axoloti to talk about?, I certainly have many, many questions and if one of you guys would give me a hand getting into the code for the patcher and firmware I'd be very grateful.</p>

<p>Why don't you guys get on the irc channel on freenode?, I'm in there.</p>

<p>I honestly feel I have been misunderstood and misjudged here and that if you go back and read my posts carefully you will find little that was directed personally at anyone other than my responses to Jaffa after several attempts to deal with his initial personal attack reasonably and politely had gone nowhere. </p>

<p>So lastly, I repeat, if you have an issue with me personally contact me privately please, Axoloti forum for Axoloti.</p>

<p>So next time you feel like accusing <em>me</em> of causing problems that actually <em>you</em> and others caused, I suggest you think twice, and basically, keep your mouth shut and give your brain time to catch-up.</p>

<p>Exactly, and if they design a piece of studio equipment that looks like a toy, then it stands to reason people are going to refer to it as one.  The only people who stand any chace of being offended by such a comment are the makers of the product.  But even if they do, that's just too bad because people will always refer to it however they please.  It is a toy, it looks like a toy, and is not exactly going to improve the aesthetic of your studio sitting among your hi-tech gear, is it now.</p>

<p>I'm glad Jaffa likes it, but I don't.  There is no way I'd pay <em>anywhere near</em> the asking price for something that looks as cheap as that thing does - no matter how good it is.  Most I'd pay for an Organelle is around £120, and even then, I'm talking brand new.</p>

<p>This is another reason we need to tackle the political awareness nonsense - ON THE SPOT.</p>

<blockquote><p>Come on. Since you want to go there all the time, it must be an easy answer. It must be important to you. Also why is it that you must reserve you right to be rude to be people, just because you can?</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>The simple answer to that is NO, and here is the reason why.  If we read the political correctness bullshit posted around the web, and <em><strong>then</strong></em> went somewhere else to debate it, that would allow the political correctness to remain, and would not permit onlookers to see the <em><strong>correct</strong></em> response to political correctness.</p>

<p>Your way of thinking does not work.  There are countless websites about this stuff but the only people who visit them are the people who are already aware of the problem.  Much better to catch people at it, and rectify them ON THE SPOT where the bullshit took place, and eventually, over time, this will contribute to political correctness getting it's ugly head crushed.</p>

<p>Do you understand now?</p>

<p>Not true, I am <strong><em>much</em></strong> more shady, and you are even dumber than you sound if you honestly thought I see you as a friend or even give a flying fuck about it <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/laughing.png?v=5" title=":laughing:" class="emoji" alt=":laughing:"></p>

<p>I'm guessing it must be a cultural thing, but even so there is no excuse for the limit of some peoples humour, or for their inability to detect sarcasm.

<blockquote><p>It would be like fight club.<br>Rule 1, outside of fight club, no one talks about fight club.<br>Rule 2, no one talks about rule 1.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>Fight clubs are for men wanting excuses to see other men in the locker room.</p>

<p>I prefer the Mafia approach of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Target problem</li>
<li>Remove problem</li>
<li>Problem gone</li>
</ul>

<p>It's like when some dude dressed in white with a black belt around him starts waving his arms around, kicking his legs in the air, and making funny noises.</p>

<p>OOOOOOH!<br>AAAAAAAAAAAH!<br>AYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYAH!</p>

<p>A quick pull of the trigger is much more effective cause these peeps <em>cannot</em> catch a bullet between thier teeth, they always miss so the bullet always ends-up coming out of the back of their head.</p>
