        <p>Personally I don't think this is the place for such discussion, but it would seem to me that given what is happening in the real world it is inevitable that issues are going to come up even in places not dedicated to discussing them.</p>

<p>I had no intention of turning this into a political debate.</p>

<p>I never could have imagined that a few off the cuff remarks about a box with buttons could cause so much trouble.</p>

<p>I'm an Australian as well Gavin, I guess Aussie humour doesn't travel so well and can easily be misunderstood by those not used to it. A feature of Australian humour is that you can never quite tell if the person is being serious or not and that can lead to misunderstandings with people.</p>

<p>They are just words people, not gunshots, learn the difference, try not to take everything so seriously and personally.</p>

<p>Why should you care if I disagree with you about a material object that you didn't make yourself?</p>

<p>I can admit I not the most tactful person, but this place seems to be far too overly sensitive to even the most gentle and carefully worded criticism and I personally don't think that is good for the future of the project or the community around it.</p>

<p>Harden the fuck up people</p>

<p>Stick and stones etc.</p>

        <p>You are pretty much alone with your shady attitudes. As Gavin pointed out and as I pointed out about 100 times, it has nothing to do with political correctness. But just being polite to each other. Do you expect a person that you have just just put down to help you? You have NO situational awareness what so ever.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/axoman.html">@axoman</a> you still have not managed to answer the question I asked you, which is the root to why we end up in these discussion over and over again:</p>

<blockquote><ul><li>What has the world situation to do with patching in Axoloti?</li></ul></blockquote></aside>

<p>Come on. Since you want to go there all the time, it must be an easy answer. It must be important to you. Also why is it that you must reserve you right to be rude to be people, just because you can?</p>

<p>Please answer those 2 questions. They are pretty simple....</p>

<p>And again Axoman, you managed to make this post about you.... Another post you managed to make about yourself. Which means this post ended up becoming about nothing relevant, as you are. And STILL you have not posted one thing to the community library. Nothing...... All you do is mingle in on debates that had nothing to do with you and make them off topic. That is what you do. And if I was admin in here you would be banned long time ago.</p>

<p> <a class="mention" href="../../u/axoman.html">@axoman</a> From the bottom of my heart, no we are not friends and we have never been friends and we will never be friends. Do you understand that? Probably not, as your posts clearly shows lack of situational awareness.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/strum.html">@strum</a> You are just as much as shady character as Axoman. Wmo must have the absolute power to insult other people just because you feel like it.....</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/johannes.html">@johannes</a><br>You should take this seriously if you want to keep your forum relevant. Now there are 2 of these types in here.... Just wait in a few month this forum is going to be FULL mudthrowing if you don't act on it in the near future. It is just going to end up like any of the other 100's of non relevant groups out there,  where abusive language and actions are accepted.....</p>

        <p>You know there is a very creative and artistic element to communicating without boundaries, and am sure there are many of us like this in here, but like spiderman, with great power comes great responsibility, so I propose what we might need here, is a "Enter at your own risk" category.<br>This would be for any Axoloti members who want to let loose, but all who enter must agree that the language and tone used is kept in this category only, and the other Categories are kept for members to read and absorb in an objective environment that allows them to make up their own mind about what suits them without any unnecessary influence caused by potentially disruptive communication. And if they want to let loose about the same topic, create a new one at your own risk to let loose. But just remember, breaking the rules is still choice, political correctness is not about rules, but is about not allowing your choices to be poorly influenced by them, but I also believe to let the creative juices flow, you do need to open the flood gates occasionally. And Mark <a class="mention" href="../../u/thetechnobear.html">@thetechnobear</a> , you have said before that in some ways you want members to break the rules, here's a chance to give it a stomping ground. If it gets out of control, just pull it.</p>

<p>Well just a thought.. <img src="http://community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>

<blockquote><p>so I propose what we might need here, is a "Enter at your own risk" category.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>What a SUPER idea. But I have a feeling that some people might not be able to keep those debates in that category......... </p>

<p>Creative juices are totally cool with me. But talking about politics and Axo or any other instrument, has nothing to do with each other. So yeah if one wants to talk politics, keep it in that group. Politics are such an ichy topic these days. And I REALLy enjoys these forums that has nothing to do with politics, talking about and learning about my hobby, which I care about a lot. And I really don't want my hobby to be polluted by non relevant political debates about, something that has no relevans to anything we do in here. </p>

<p>But on the other hand.. There are 100's of places for these debates all ready. Why not just use one of those?</p>

<p>Then wether we like it or not, we need rules to protect those who do not compete at fight club. All those who enter fight club can only complain about those in fight club, although quotes from outside fight club can be referenced.</p>

<blockquote><p>Why should you care if I disagree with you about a material object that you didn't make yourself?</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>Exactly, and if they design a piece of studio equipment that looks like a toy, then it stands to reason people are going to refer to it as one.  The only people who stand any chace of being offended by such a comment are the makers of the product.  But even if they do, that's just too bad because people will always refer to it however they please.  It is a toy, it looks like a toy, and is not exactly going to improve the aesthetic of your studio sitting among your hi-tech gear, is it now.</p>

<p>I'm glad Jaffa likes it, but I don't.  There is no way I'd pay <em>anywhere near</em> the asking price for something that looks as cheap as that thing does - no matter how good it is.  Most I'd pay for an Organelle is around £120, and even then, I'm talking brand new.</p>

<p>The simple answer to that is NO, and here is the reason why.  If we read the political correctness bullshit posted around the web, and <em><strong>then</strong></em> went somewhere else to debate it, that would allow the political correctness to remain, and would not permit onlookers to see the <em><strong>correct</strong></em> response to political correctness.</p>

<p>Your way of thinking does not work.  There are countless websites about this stuff but the only people who visit them are the people who are already aware of the problem.  Much better to catch people at it, and rectify them ON THE SPOT where the bullshit took place, and eventually, over time, this will contribute to political correctness getting it's ugly head crushed.</p>

<p>Do you understand now?</p>

<p>Not true, I am <strong><em>much</em></strong> more shady, and you are even dumber than you sound if you honestly thought I see you as a friend or even give a flying fuck about it <img src="http://community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/laughing.png?v=5" title=":laughing:" class="emoji" alt=":laughing:"></p>

<p>I'm guessing it must be a cultural thing, but even so there is no excuse for the limit of some peoples humour, or for their inability to detect sarcasm.  BTW, thanks for liking my cat posts, strum, I'm glad someone here isn't afraid their face might crack <img src="http://community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>

<p>Fight clubs are for men wanting excuses to see other men in the locker room.</p>

<p>I prefer the Mafia approach of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Target problem</li>
<li>Remove problem</li>
<li>Problem gone</li>
</ul>

<p>It's like when some dude dressed in white with a black belt around him starts waving his arms around, kicking his legs in the air, and making funny noises.</p>

<p>OOOOOOH!<br>AAAAAAAAAAAH!<br>AYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYAH!</p>

<p>A quick pull of the trigger is much more effective cause these peeps <em>cannot</em> catch a bullet between thier teeth, they always miss so the bullet always ends-up coming out of the back of their head.</p>

        <p>So anyway, Jaffa, I take it by now that you have finally realised.  Had there been no political correctness going on then this conversation would not be here at all.  And had you not continued with the conversation, then it would not continue.</p>

<p>So next time you feel like accusing <em>me</em> of causing problems that actually <em>you</em> and others caused, I suggest you think twice, and basically, keep your mouth shut and give your brain time to catch-up.</p>

<p>Thanks for understanding <img src="http://community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/sunglasses.png?v=5" title=":sunglasses:" class="emoji" alt=":sunglasses:"></p>

        <p>I'd like to clarify my position somewhat here if I may in the hope of putting an end to this .</p>

<p>I had no idea this was going to turn into a shit fight and certainly had not intended to start one.</p>

<p>I had no idea of what happened between Jaffa and Axoman before.</p>

<p>I had not been very active on the forum until recently and have no previous connections with anybody here.</p>

<p>Though I agree with a lot of what Axoman says I am not in any way associated with him or allied with him and I disagree with him on some of the things he has said.</p>

<p>I think that this is not the place for this sort of discussion and did not wish to try and make it a place for that, there are plenty of other places to do that.</p>

<p>I would like to keep my involvement focused on the project and not get involved in anything personal or political here.</p>

<p>If I have offended anyone by expressing my opinions in an undiplomatic way I apologise sincerely, if you have an issue with something I have said please feel free to contact me by private message and I will be happy to have a polite and reasonable discussion with you about it if you can refrain from getting irrational, emotional and abusive. Such behaviour will likely result in treatment in kind.</p>

<p>I will do my best in future to not start this sort of thing again, but I do feel that things need to loosen up here, people need to relax and not be so intolerant of people's differences, can we just focus on the shared interest we have in Axoloti instead please?</p>

<p>I had been aware of the sensitivity of this place since my first involvement here and have actually been self censoring quite a lot because of that already believe it or not.</p>

<p>I think speech on the Axoloti forum should be almost entirely focused on Axoloti and all personal, religious, political, ethnic, gender or other identity class issues kept to the absolute, and I mean ABSOLUTE, minimum necessary.</p>

<p>If you want to talk about those things do it somewhere else or in private.</p>

<p>It think it is a sad and sorry state of affairs that this has been the most active thread on here for the last 3 days and that none of us are working on the project. We all need to take a look at ourselves</p>

<p>I've taken time out from my patching work to make this post but I felt I needed to try and finish what I started.</p>

<p>Again we all need to take a good hard look at ourselves, nobody is immune to the Dunning-Kruger effect, thinking you are is a symptom of it.</p>

<p>I'm am trying to keep my involvement in this storm in a teacup to a minimum so as not to fan the flames and I apologise again for starting it, can we all be the bigger men and drop it?</p>

<p>I don't want to have to reply to this again.</p>

<p>Surely we have plenty of Axoloti to talk about?, I certainly have many, many questions and if one of you guys would give me a hand getting into the code for the patcher and firmware I'd be very grateful.</p>

<p>Why don't you guys get on the irc channel on freenode?, I'm in there.</p>

<p>I honestly feel I have been misunderstood and misjudged here and that if you go back and read my posts carefully you will find little that was directed personally at anyone other than my responses to Jaffa after several attempts to deal with his initial personal attack reasonably and politely had gone nowhere. </p>

<p>So lastly, I repeat, if you have an issue with me personally contact me privately please, Axoloti forum for Axoloti.</p>

        <p>Sorry about that, just add <em><strong>community.</strong></em> before the URL (and don't forget the dot).</p>

<p>I had to do it like that because this annoying forum software kept posting quotes from the thread I was trying to post a link to.  I'd love to know what software this forum uses cause they've sprang-up all over the web all of a sudden and that's actually quite disturbing.  Everything about the design and the way it works is 'pushy' and 'manipulative' in nature and makes me think one of the tech giants are behind it's design.</p>

<p>All it ever does is treat people like kids, giving them "awards" for such things as making a first post.  Or thanking someone, or whatever.  The design stinks of Apple and Google-like manipulation and mentality, and the data-retention system it uses stinks of NSA involvement.</p>

<p>You can't even talk in private on these forums due to it having a system where anyone in the conversation can invite someone else.  I'm guessing this is an experiment to see how it effects what people say to each other in private discussions.  Private discussions are supposed to be just that, and no one in the discussion should be able to bring anyone else into it.  Having the ability to do that will effect what people would normally say in private. It's a completely immoral concept which, like I said, stinks of Apple or Google, Facebook etc.</p>

<p>I think whoever designed this forum software is a control freak, and completely psychopathic in nature.</p>

        <p>Finally, no back-chat from Jaffa, I guess he's finally understood the situation.</p>

<p>And take a look at that, speaking of "pushy" forum software it's even lecturing me on how to post now!<br>Here's the message that just popped up on my screen ...</p>

<p><em><strong>"Let others join the conversation.  This topic is clearly important to you – you've posted more than 20% of the replies here.  Are you sure you’re providing adequate time for other people to share their points of view, too?"</strong></em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The simple answer to that is NO, and here is the reason why.  If we read the political correctness bullshit posted around the web, and then went somewhere else to debate it, that would allow the political correctness to remain, and would not permit onlookers to see the correct response to political correctness.</p>
<p>Your way of thinking does not work.  There are countless websites about this stuff but the only people who visit them are the people who are already aware of the problem.  Much better to catch people at it, and rectify them ON THE SPOT where the bullshit took place, and eventually, over time, this will contribute to political correctness getting it's ugly head crushed.</p>
</blockquote></aside>

<p>Sorry you are talking so much gibberish. But again you are totally misunderstanding the idea. You keep talking about political correctness. But in a forum like this it has to do with being nice to each other and help each other. When you want to interact with someone, it is just good approach to be nice.</p>

<p>Yes I get it you reserve the right to be rude to anyone at any second of the day. That is what it is about. I dont care about political correctness in this forum, I care about being nice to each other. And then we are back to the fact that evertime there is a debate you have to drag in things from the surrounding world that bothers you and make the debate about that. I get it. You dont know patching. You cant write an object. You seem to be more interested in politics than synthezeiser...... So all left to do is to debate politics....... But the things is... The things you debate..are...not....relevant....to..this.....group.. Why are you actually in this group?</p>

<p>So if you say it is not worth it to be polite to each other you say it is bullshit to be nice and polite. So what is a good way to approach each other? What is the best way to approach someone you want to ask for help or talk to? "hey asshole, please help me?""hey asshole, how are you?" How should we address each other when we approach each other as humans? This is not about political correctness but about being friendly. And you obviously dont know how to do that. </p>

<p>Cause again, the only thing I read form your disturbing world view is that you want to reserve you the right to talk about anything, in any forum, at any time, even though it is not relevant to the forum you want to debate it. </p>

<p>But seriously..... Do you think anyone wants to help you when you talk to people like that and cant keep on topic?</p>

<blockquote><p>Not sure how long you guys have left, but I'm guessing spying on everyones kids throught smartphones and webcams while wanking yourselves senseless at NSA HQ, is eventually going to backfire on you.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>You are seriously disturbed. I am starting to think you probably got some serious mental health issues, so now I start to feel sorry for you instead.</p>

<p>Again, you are pushing your disturbing world view on others. In psychology that is called projection &gt; pushing ones own disturbing thoughts onto someone else and make it sound like it is their believe and that is how one raises his kids. It is a defense mechanism. Add you do it over and over. You have serious issues, that is all I have learned from this debate.</p>
