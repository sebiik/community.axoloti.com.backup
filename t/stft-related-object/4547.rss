    <title>STFT-related object?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/stft-related-object/4547</link>
    <description>Hello! This is my first post, and I guess the title tells evreything. 
I&#39;d love to use STFT analysis on the input signal at the beginning of a patch. I know there are struggles, ie 8 megs of sram, and a 16-samples workflow all the way.
I&#39;m confused, since my dev experiences are web-related, and i&#39;ve never been taught how to write C or any object language. My DSP understanding is almost null, but i have an idea of what the patch should look like.
A mate came across [this link](https://www.nayuki.io/page/free-small-fft-in-multiple-languages) and told me to watch for the &quot;C (C99 and above) (pairs of reals)&quot; paragraph. 
So far and if I understood well, the .c files contain the definitions, and the .h files contain the function prototype defintions.
I assume this might be somehow complex or unrealistic as a first attempt, but could anyone either give me a hand with this, or explain me why and how it would be impossible? 
Thanks, have a nice day!</description>

              <p>Looking at the axoloti code I see:</p>

<p>./firmware/mutable_instruments/clouds/dsp/pvoc/stft.h<br>./firmware/mutable_instruments/clouds/dsp/pvoc/stft.cpp</p>

<p>Which is probably worth a look to see if it does what you want.</p>

<p>Also - the code you referenced uses double - which it to be avoided on a platform that only has FPU support for single precision FP. The CMSIS DSP libraries from ARM contain FFT implementations that are probably better than any generic code you are likely to find.</p>
