        <p>This has got my brain occupied too much these last hours... still trying to guess. <br>The only thing I thought of, before the "framing you" quote, was a some kind of table editor. But it doesn't make much sense. </p>

<p>I then thought about what I really needed, and hoped it would be an audience controller :imagine a concert room, position is the row number, value the column number. Then you can add someone to the audience, or delete them (if they are too noisy, fallen asleep, or not drunk enough) and used tells us if the seat is taken or free. </p>

<p>But I wouldn't mind <a class="mention" href="/users/the19thbear">@the19thbear</a> 's guess either</p>

<p>I'm sure it will be fun / useful anyway (like most of your stuff, at least the ones I understand)<br><a class="mention" href="/users/sirsicksik">@SirSickSik</a> you sure know how to tease (looking forward to testing your vowel synth too)</p>

        <p>well, I guesss your guess is pretty close with the "table editor", go look up the eurorack modular "frame module".<br>Though I must say, the thing you see here is still an empty shell as I  want to make it a little bit nicer and need to figure out how to code that <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=2" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>end goal (for following module): a preset-learning module where presets are positioned in a multi-dimensional grid., based on coordinates you set yourself (name the "dimensions", eg, you could use "feelings" as name, and dial in the position you think the preset should take. From there you could multi-dimensionaly morph through all your presets (it's a wish I have had for many years, but couldn't be done in synthedit without making a SERIOUSLY HUGE project which would have cpu problems because of the immense graphics (millions of lines to be drawn)) <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/imp.png?v=2" title=":imp:" class="emoji" alt=":imp:"></p>

        <p>pfoeh, that frames module is a bit more work then I previously thought..got to learn a bit more first I guess haha<br>so in the meanwhile something else:</p>

<p>NEW MODULE:</p>

<p>FILTER<br>"resonatorP"</p>

<p>Complex Resonator filter</p>

<p>Filter can be used for formant creation, allpass effects, frequency-resonator, plucked string (using dirac module), percussion, etc..</p>

<p>pitch control is in semitones (0=440hz, this is changable to other values if you want, just embed the module and change the "440" in the code to the required base-frequency).</p>

<p>resonance sets resonation length (the higher the tone, the shorter it will be-&gt;logarithmic response). When fed a dirac pulse it will make a sine that quickly fades out.</p>

<p>gain and max controls are from the "fatbasterd" distortion, to saveguard the output and enabling a nasty resonating distortion.</p>

<p>Max sets max-output value (where the amplitude will be dampened at a max level)</p>

<p>Gain sets the rate at which the output goes to the max, respectively to the input.</p>

        <p>an oscillator with a limited amount of waveforms now belongs to the past!<br>I've added some more sculpting toys (an harmonic sine generator to add harmonics to the current waveform) and a progressive "changer (the longer you hold the button, the more it gets changed-&gt;saves you lots of whrist-pain).</p>

<p>and a fast update, the module just got really awesome! XD<br>While holding down the "sine" button, you now progressively add an harmonic series to the existing waveform. This can be done realtime without bleeping! Depending on the parameters, you can set the amount of harmonics in the series, their even/odd phase-offset and the harmonic-spreading of the series.</p>

<p>NEW MODULE:</p>

<p>OSC</p>

<p>"sculptor"<br>-sculptor is based on wavetable synthesis and uses a table to save it's waveforms.</p>

<p>-each waveform is 1024 samples long.</p>

<p>-pressing the "clear" button will clear the current table-&gt;no sound!</p>

<p>-holding "sine" will progressively add sine-waves to the existing table. <br>-The "harmonic" box sets the start harmonic the first added sine will be on. <br>-Even/odd harmonics have a # degrees phase shift depending on the "phase" box.<br>-Each higher harmonic will be of a lower volume than the previous lower harmonic (quarter of the volume less then the previous one).<br>-"jump" sets the harmonic-spreading between each extra sine that's added while holding down the "sine" button.<br>-"steps" sets the count-max for the amount of sines you want to add, before the count starts again and just adds the same ros of harmonics again, saturating the volume of these harmonics.<br>-don't forget to push "normalise" and "dcRemove" every once in a while, so the waveform doesn't become too "hot".</p>

<p>-holding change will progressively add small random shapes to the current waveform.</p>

<p>-pressing the "randomise" button will randomise the waveform.</p>

<p>-though the randomised waveform is full of harmonics, holding the smooth-button will progressively smooth out the waveform by averaging each point in the table with another point that has a selectable offset position to the table-position being avaraged ("with" parameter).</p>

<p>-with the "with" parameter you select with which other position you average the selected table position (which is in a "for-loop", so all table positions are being recalculated after each other.<br>So if "with" is set to 1, each point will be averaged with the next one. If set to 5, each point will be averaged with a point 5 steps next to it. The higher you go, the more you alter the harmonic content: notch or upper harmonic creation.</p>

<p>-after sculpting, you can subtract any DC-offset from the table and normalise the waveform.</p>

<p>-if you have your waveform, you save it using the "save" button to any of the available preset-positions (preset box) (depending on the table-size you have set on the allocation module). I set mine to 524288, which allows me to store up to 512 waveforms!</p>

<p>-to load a waveform, select a preset number and press "load". (REMEMBER!! you need to have a filled table-allocation module to load the waveform from!! If there isn't one yet, it can't find anything and thus won't load anything! In this case (first time you use this module), you first have to make your own table!)</p>

<p>-"morph" sets the rate the current table is morphed into the next selected preset after you hit "load". This is done by fading between 2 arrays and updating them one by one. NOTE! If you hit "load" before a new table is totally faded in, it will update the other and thus immediately change the sound instead of morphing it! Don't worry though, it won't bleep!</p>

<p>NOTE! To be able to actually save your waveforms, you need to add the table-save and table-load modules from the axoloti table folder! This way you can reload your carefully created waveforms after shutdown!</p>

<p>-when you have a preset-file, load it into the table (loud long beep as always) and hit "load" on the "sculptor" oscillator. Now it loads the selected preset from the table WITHOUT A BEEP! For any of your other waveforms, you won't hear any beep while switching presets as long as you don't use the "table save/load" mechanism! (keep that for after your recording/liveset/etc)</p>

<p>-"softness" controls a lowpass filter, the higher the value, the more it dampens the sound.</p>

        <p>NEW MODULE:</p>

<p>OSC<br>"morphor"</p>

<p>based on the sculptor, but without the editing parameters.</p>

<p>Also, instead of a "lowpass morphed" change between presets, this uses an internal LFO to update the two tables to the currently selected preset-value and to morph between them using a sine-shape (thus always smooth)</p>

<p>You can "override" the load by sending a gate high to the load input (will update one of the tables and the other one at the next trigger, over and over..etc) This is useful, since the tables are updated by the LFO and it might take a while before the first trigger is send to update the table from a preset.</p>

<p>An extra phase-output (also in the sculptor) is added that you can use for adding shaped signals to the wavetable sound (eg use one of my phase-shaper modules).</p>

<p>NOTE!!!<br>Don't forget to add the table allocation module and set the name to a table that you have recorded to!<br>If you haven't made a wavetable yet, by using the sculptor, you won't hear a thing!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>NEW MODULES:</p>

<p>FILTER:<br>"formant filter"<br>"formantController"</p>

<p>SHAPE:<br>"formantshaper"</p>

<p>3 different modules that can be combined to create formants from an external oscillator. (morphor and Sculptor are perfect for this!)</p>

<p>Controller outputs 5 different settings for frequency, BW and gain (can't use these on the normal filters, only on the formant filter, sorry!)</p>

<p>Formant filter has 5 bandpass filters and 2 BP filter modes to be selected.<br>An extra resonance knob allows to dial in more resonance then set from the table from the formantcontroller.</p>

<p>Formant shaper allows to "hard" shape your oscillator sound.<br>It uses zero-crossing to sync the 5 internal oscillators to the phase input and uses the "throat" input to amplitude-modulate (AM) the created sines.</p>

<blockquote><p>the sculptor is meant as a table designer as I don't think it's a really great idea to automate this stuff..the axoloti might get quite a headache if you're going to do that I think..Better just create a table to which you save your designed presets and then load these with the morphor oscillator.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>still dont check how to morph between presets, and wich presets...i would really appreciate if you could upload a patch...</p>

<p>this demo can be used to understand the "sculptor" and "morphor" oscillators. Also shows the 4xRngCount2 pattern modules and key-scaler.</p>

<p>SO PLEASE READ THIS:</p>

<ol>
<li>first use the sculptor to make a wavetable for yourself!</li>
<li>BEFORE stopping the patch, PRESS SAVE on the table save/button</li>
<li>only THEN you can use the morphor to morph through the presets. For quick load, use the "load" button (press twice to fill both preset-arrays. Or set "morph" to a higher rate, so it S&amp;H's the preset input faster.</li>
</ol>

<p>4: don't forget to add the "0:/" in front of the table name when you save it to SDcard, otherwise the wavetable is only usable within that same patch and not in any other patch!!!</p>

<p>oh... and lastly... <br>as you can save your presets to a table, feel free to share the table!! <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=2" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>if we got enough tables, I'll make a table combiner, so we can combine all our waveforms into a single, massive 2048-sample table!</p>

        <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/users/philoop">@philoop</a> for your small demo patch, just wanted to say that your phi/clock/Tbclock7 object is corrupt because it uses a xor4 object that is inexistant in the library (easily replaceable by 3 xor2 objects).</p>

<p>and Thanks <a class="mention" href="/users/sirsicksik">@SirSickSik</a> for these new objects and the demo patch. The morphing OSC are very fun / interesting indeed</p>

        <p>I had a couple of requests about adding inputs to the randomisation and other waveform customisations on the sculptor.<br>Although it sounds like a great idea, I'm afraid this will make very unstable synthesizers. Although it doesn't show up on the cpu readout, in reality the cpu shoots up to about 70% for a really short time. If you'ld do that in a complete synthesizer, it will probably crash or otherwise just glitch.</p>

<p>of course, you can always ignore my warning and control it through a mod-source... though, I don't advice that <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=2" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

        <p>when using this module.... please, oh please... first read this very well..</p>

<p>NEW MODULE:</p>

<p>SEQ:<br>"shufflingGateSequencer":</p>

<p>"constant from 16 flags".....hmmmm... that one evolved quickly...</p>

<p>FIRST ADD A TABLE ALLOCATION MODULE AND "TABLE SAVE" MODULE FROM THE FACTORY TABLE FOLDER!!!!!!!!!! and make a structure to save the table into a .tab file! BEFORE EDITTING!!!<br>(otherwise you'll lose everything as you can't save it as it's needed to stop the patcher to add the modules and restart the patcher... NOOOOOOOOooooooooo!..... <em>sight</em>)</p>

<p>4 channel 64-step(max) gate sequencer with 1024 presets per-bank. (positions and values are saved together as a single decimal number, so 1024 numbers equals 1024 sequences per bank!)<br>Each step has 4 positions (white=chance0, light gray=chance1, dark gray=chance2 and black). A black step always generates a high gate, the others can be given a random-chance value of that step generating a gate. (chance of colors set by the chance0, chance1 and chance2 controls)</p>

<p>There's no internal storage memory, so the module loads banks from- and saves to table allocation module (size at least 4* 1024*(number of banks)  ).<br>Because of this, there are no presets available when you use this module for the first time.</p>

<p> -Then first edit the bars of the sequencer to have a rhythm.<br> -check whether you're saving to the right bar ("bar" selector)<br> -check whether you've saving to the right preset ("seqwrite" selector, for first timers, start with preset/slot 0).<br> -set the preset load position ("seqread" selector) to the same number (for first timers, this will be preset/slot 0)<br> -press "save"<br> -your sequence has now been saved to the internal memory at the preset/slot and in the bar that you've selected.</p>

<p> -now select another BAR.<br> -now EITHER:<br>             -press "save", which will save the same sequence of the former bar to the next bar. Do this 2 times more and you've filled your 64 step sequence.<br> -OOOORRRRRR<br>             -in case the internal memory is empty at that spot, press load, and it will reset all the bars to zero. (This will be your "first-time" case, it will reset as there's no preset to  <br>              load).<br>             -in case the internal memory is NOT empty in the newly selected bar, but contains another sequence (previously loaded from a table or eddited before), it will load that sequence into <br>              the sequence editor.</p>

<p> -after editting all the BARS and saving them TO THE SAME(!!) "seqwrite" number, you can select a new "seqwrite".<br> -to start a fresh sequence (empty editor) and the internal memory is empty in the selected "seqread", press "load" to quick-reset sequence.<br> -if you already have a sequence in that position, and want to load that one, select the same number for "seqread" and press load for all the bars.<br> -if you already have a sequence in that position (seqwrite) but want to over-write it with another sequence (seqread) (eg, your former sequence):<br>        -This can be done quite quickly: <br>        -select sequence you want to copy FROM in "seqread" and the sequence to write to in "seqwrite".<br>        -then select bar1, press "load", press "save", select next bar, press "load", press "save', etc. for the two other <br>        bars <br>        (takes you 4 seconds most with a mouse..?)<br>        -then edit the copied bars one by one (select a bar, press load-&gt;loads into editor-&gt;edit sequence-&gt;press save&gt; REPEAT WITH NEXT BAR)</p>

<p>It's pretty important to understand how this bar/preset-system and read/write-functions (load/save) work, as you might very well be over-writing or loading the wrong sequence.. destroying precious old or freshly found sequences!</p>

<p>TO FINISH THIS OFF!!!<br>Hope you read and added a "save table" module by now, as when you press "stop" after editing to add the "save" module, you just lost everything except your last loaded sequence in the editor!!</p>

<p>-if you made some sequence-presets you can save these to the table allocator by first selecting a "bank" and then pressing "Psave". Each bank will have 1024 positions for sequences.<br>-now press "save" for the "table save" module, to save the table into a file on your SDRAM card. (oh shit, you didn't have one... all for nothing.. go get it!! <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=2" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> )<br>-your table is now saved onto your SDRAM card.</p>

<p>-TO RE-LOAD old files, add a "table load" module from the factory table folder and give it the same table-name to load the table to as the "save table" module.<br>-then press "Pload" on the sequencer module (this module that would be..). The table is now loaded into the sequencer and ready to be used (if you're triggering the sequencer already, it should be sending out gates already-&gt;it's the internal memory that's used to play the sequences.</p>

<p>NOW THE FUN PART STARTS!<br>All those boolean-inputs at the side?? </p>

<p>-First one is of course for triggering the internal counter.<br>-Counting modifications to bitswap/shift/logic, bit-invert and reverse (from current play position) the counter output with external sequences/controls. (internal counter itself is untouched, so it always goes back to where it should have been if  the modification wouldn't happen.)</p>

<p>well.. guess that's the "only couple of things you need to know"..... ghehe</p>

<p>oh no, one last thing... a picture..<br>and it has a preset-control input for selecting sequences from that 1024-big preset list for each bank <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=2" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/6ae282a41c5c5ce19d74130aa2cc1bfee3d19da4" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6ae282a41c5c5ce19d74130aa2cc1bfee3d19da4.jpg" class="lightbox" title="ShufflingGateSequencer.jpg"><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/6ae282a41c5c5ce19d74130aa2cc1bfee3d19da4_1_690x500.jpg" width="690" height="500"><div class="meta">

        <p>as I've said, more functions will be added later on (busy on it)<br>when I'm finished, I'll just upload the patch that I used to make it with.. with some explanation</p>

<p>and ps... just work from top to bottom.. the sequence of parameters might explain a bit more if understood this way.</p>

<p>when editing, you start on top, work to bottom.<br>when loading, you start from bottom.</p>

<p>if you need to know how to make that table safe/load, try out that demo I've uploaded couple of posts ago..<br>you shouldn't need much more then that, plus (to connect to the module)<br>1. an LFO (trigger) (you gotta need a clock source)<br>2. external preset-select (integer control, hey, you gotta be able to select a preset to play, right?)<br>3. four drums as destinations for the gate outputs.</p>

<p>all the other inputs and outputs are "extra's", not needed for the module to work in the standard way. They're just there to be able to connect external sequencers (count out) and modify the internal counter (bool inputs and int inputs)</p>
