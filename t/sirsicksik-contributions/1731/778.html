        <p>NEW MODULE</p>

<p>ENV</p>

<p>"ahdsr"<br>2 voice Attack/hold/decay/sustain/release envelope, linear attack, exponential decay and release.</p>

<p>The main out gives the highest envelope (max of 1/2), this is how it would be if just a single envelope was used (monophonic). Use this, for example, for a filter or if you're using only a single oscillator.</p>

<p>Envelope 1 and 2 are used together with 2 oscillators and vca's to produce a dual-voice. With every new gate, the next envelope goes into attack stage and the other is forced into release state, fading out the voice (less clicks).<br>Has trigger outputs to show which envelope is retriggered, which can be used to latch the pitch of the new voice to the right oscillator (factory/logic/latch).</p>

<p>And I've also just added extra outputs for new-stage-triggers&amp;stage-number per voice and main/mono.<br>These can be used to trigger extra envelopes at certain stages. Eg. the factory AD-envelope is nice for this together with the "stageTrig" module.</p>

<p>"stageTrig"<br>a module to be used with the ahdsr2v module. It only lets the "new stage" trigger through when the stage matches the stage set by the stage-selector. (this selector only goes from 0 to 3, but if you embed the module, you can enter any range you want for your own use)</p>

        <p>This is starting to be very frustrating... what the heck is going wrong everytime?!?<br>I know there are some problems with 44 modules, which cannot be updated because of some mismatch in files, but this shouldn't interfere with new modules I make..<br>Last time this happened was just before 29th september and I thought I fixed it by then as the new modules back then showed up..</p>

        <p>NEW MODULE</p>

<p>HARMONY</p>

<p>"tonnetzSeq"</p>

<p>A tonnetz-sequence chord generator.</p>

<p>Several gates/triggers are used to make chord progression based on the tonnetz-progression theory.</p>

<p>First three inputs are "toggled gate" controlled: when the input is high, it goes in "the other" mode, when gate is low, it switches back.<br>P=parallel: switches the major for the minor and reverse.<br>R=relative: switches over to the relative of the chord<br>L=leading tone: switches between leading tones</p>

<p>Next four inputs are triggered: every time the input goes high, it adds/subtracts a fourth or a fifth to/from all note in the chord.<br>pF=add a fifth to all notes in the chord (5th can be multiplied by Fmode-selector to make bigger jumps. Eg. going from F(IV) to G(V) would be Fmode=2)<br>nF=subtract a fifth from all notes in the chord<br>pf=add a fourth to all notes in the chord(4th can be multiplied by fmode-selector)<br>nf=subtract a fourth from all notes in the chord<br>iU=inverse the chord up by adding an octave to the lowest note in the chord.<br>iD=inverse the chord down by subtracting an octave from the highest note in the chord.</p>

<p>Note! Internally the octaves are wrapped back (pendulum-wise) when going above the max-octave setting, this will cause the octave to step down to 0 before going up again (only noticable when octave is set to 3 or higher). This will only influence the octave-number, not the note being played.</p>

<p>Next to the basic triad, four additional notes are being generated based on the notes of the triad. Together with the notes of the triad, these can be used to generate a melody next to the chord.</p>

<p>The sequence can be forced to reset at a note and mode (major/minor).<br>Next to this, the amount of octaves that can be played, can be set using the "octaves" selector. Note that this responds in a "pendulum-wise" manner, though the notes stay the same. So if a note internally goes up one octave, but passes the max-octave setting, it actually goes down one octave at the output.</p>

<p>For more information on tonnetz sequences, see this video on youtube:<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWyu9uwKtp0" rel="nofollow noopener">tonnetz video</a></p>

<p>To get a sequence to progress, you need to swap between changing L,R and P. If either one is toggled a second time without something else being changed, it just goes back to the former chord. Though of course, you can always send dual-triggers, triggering two or more changes at the same time.<br>The "gateSpreader" module (patt/gateSpreader) combined with a 0/1 counter /flipflop to generate a toggled gate works really well with this module.</p>

        <p>I'm not basing my codes on other codes except for the ones in the axoloti if I need to know how to actually write something (like SINE2TINTERP(....,...) to be able to create a sine or using MTOF(...,..) to get frequency values from notes).<br>Though eurorack-land does show me lots of sweet ideas that I then try to code myself and add more functionalities if possible.<br>The tonnetz module was inspired by the tonnetz module of "Noise Engineering" after which I watched a video on it on youtube. That's where the P, R and L triggers come from. After it, I added some extra triggers that are combinations of several P,R and L transformations that are regulary used eg. IV to V (based on whether you're playing on major or minor scale). Though I'm still thinking about a control module that could automatically generate a phrase of transformations that follows a path and returning back home after a while, together with a melody generator that's based on counterpoint theory.</p>

<p>Ok. This wasn't meant as a slight (not sure if it was taken as one). I merely surmised it might be being that the code is freely available, similar to the MI stuff and perhaps the desire to see it represented in Axoloti was present. I just obtained an O_c module and the Tonnetz angle is new to me, It's a welcome addition to the cross-platform way in which I work.</p>

<p>I probably could've surmised if I had actually taken a look at the module. I tend to use the forum when at work and away from the Axoloti. Perhaps I'll reserve questions until I've actually looked at something.</p>

<p>Any ideas?<br>Thanks!</p>

<p>as you will see, I made suggestions about how to fix, but I guess these have not been implemented, as so the issues persist.</p>

<hr>

<p><a class="mention" href="../../../u/sirsicksik-2.html">@SirSickSik</a>, I think you need to resolve these issues... as I'm concerned that not only are users not seeing these updates/getting confused... but also your changes are not being 'backed up to the cloud'... i.e. you think you are syncing, but actually your changes are sitting locally on your machine.<br>anyway, as suggested previously, I suggest you copy your changes to a new directory, re-initialise the community library, and then put your changes back.<br>(frankly, you can copy your entire SSS (only!) sub tree back up without any real issue, just be careful if you have moved files)<br>note: you can you file-&gt;preferences-&gt;library-&gt;status to see what changes are going to be committed , prior to do the sync.</p>

<p>this is <strong>not</strong> what i told you to do... I said use reset all... emptying a folder and doing sync, if your unlucky, is telling git that you dont want any file in that folder i.e. delete everything<br>EDIT: yes confirmed... you manage to delete everthing in your SSS folder on the cloud <br><aside class="onebox githubcommit">

<hr>

<p>ok following is before I noticed you had deleted everything....</p>

<p>now Im going to need to think how to recover</p>

<hr>

<p>as i said before... what I would do is:</p>

<p>a) take whatever you have been working on, so what you think is your 'latest version', and put in a folder somewhere (say your desktop) <br><strong>make sure this is done correctly, you do not want to lose any files</strong><br>b) do a reset all on libraries, this will  delete everything and re-download what is in the cloud</p>

<p>then use a 'diff tool' and compare the 'cloud version' of your folder and your local copy (from step a) <br>I cant think of one off-hand but there are loads of free ones for both windows and mac, (search for something like windiff) , these will allow you to see which files and which directories are different.<br>you can then copy from your 'latest directory' anything that is missing.</p>

<p>if there is still something that is missing, then we will need to recover them from GitHub, but Im not willing to do this until you have done the above... and you are 'syncing correctly' and without a very explicit list of what is missing.<br>the reason is... if I start bringing things back and you then start syncing again they will just get deleted again, or cause conflicts... </p>

<p>this is the problem when files are copied around, and when the sync'ing is not done regularly, things get into a continuously more confusing state, since its get increasing unclear what is new, and what is old.</p>

        <p>arghh, ok, I'm going to have to do this manually </p>

<p>here is what to do - do this precisely, and NOTHING else.</p>

<p>a) do a sync again, but do NOT change anything<br>(I just need you need to be currently in sync with github)</p>

<p>b) do NOT do another sync after that until I tell you, and certainly do NOT touch your SSS folder, i.e  make no more edits until I tell you.</p>

<p>c) send me a zip file (link will do on dropbox) of what you think is your latest files.</p>

<p>d) wait until I sort it out... and do not change anything at all.<br>I'll try to do this, this evening<br>I will then tell you how to proceed.</p>

<hr>

<p>what Im going to do is:<br>- get all the files from GitHub before you deleted them.<br>- copy over your 'latest files'<br>- sync to github</p>

<p>you will then be able to sync these from GitHub, and check that the changes are correct, and alter anything that is not.<br>... you can then correct anything that is not, and then sync this changes back.</p>

<p>what Im <strong>not</strong> going to do, is make any attempt at determining what is good n bad, old or new... Im just going to assume your latest version overrides everything else, but that it might not be correct.<br>the reason is, I dont follow this thread, so I really have no idea what you have been working on, or renaming etc, so I cant make any reasonable understanding</p>

<p>anyway... send me the zip file, and I will take a look later, and sort it out... and let you know when you can re-sync with the fixes.</p>

        <p>I've send you a link to dropbox with a zipped sss-folder (the one I copied from my contrib-folder).<br>This is the folder I'm using myself and this one contains all bugfixes and latest modules. (I'm sure about it as I've been using these all the time and they loaded correctly with the right codes on my computer)</p>

<p>and argh... I just knew I would screw this up somehow, which is also the reason I hessitated doing it... sorry for that man!</p>

<p>Again, I know how to code synthesizer-functions, but there it ends.. I don't have any deeper experience with computers..<br>I just try to write modules and make music, play games and watch some video's.. Have tried to use C++ a couple of times to write modules for synthedit, but never got that working.. I couldn't even get the tutorial to work.. <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/frowningae52.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> <br>So I'm afraid it's best to not let me do this difference-checking.. I'ld probably screw that up too. It's best to hold me as far away from github as you can, before I do even more damage..</p>

        <p>OK, so its done...</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="../../../u/sirsicksik-2.html">@SirSickSik</a>,   you should now do Axoloti-&gt;File -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Reset ALL, and allow it to do the delete directories<br>... this will give you whats up on the cloud, and mean your in sync.<br>(you will then need to add your  contributor details on the  Axoloti Community library as before)</p>

<p>you should also do this with your other computer, so we dont get in a mess from there either.<br>(but only put your 'contributor' details into the computer you use for editing)</p>

<hr>

<p>so what is there now, is everything as of Sep 1 (your last commit) , but anything will the zip file (which has your 'latest versions' you supplied me replacing anything that previously existed.</p>

<p>as for checking, I think its quite simple....<br>- there may be files that you have deleted/renamed since sep 1 still in the library, you can delete these now if you wish.<br>(though, it doesn't look like this is the case, as I get no complaints for duplicate objects) <br>- if 'latest' didnt contain the latest changes, then they might be missing.</p>

<p>Ive taken a copy of what you had left after the last sync, just in case... but Im assuming the zip file you supplied was your latest n greatest.</p>

<p>anyway, so I would go thru and check, and after your changes do another sync, so that we all know the right versions are up in the cloud.</p>

<p>then id recommend:<br>a) try to sync regularly, so you know its working...<br>b) remember deleting a file locally, will mean at next sync, it will be deleted in the cloud<br>c) dont make changes on multiple computers, try to have one as 'master'<br>d) try not to copy files around, its easy to get confused about what is the latest version<br>e) try to avoid renaming/deleting things, this can get confusing ... better to get right first time.</p>

<p>anyway, hope everything should be sorted and ok now.</p>
