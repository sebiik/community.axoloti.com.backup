<p>The delay function is a written delay into the sequence that is recorded, just repeating notes that are within the selection of the channels/notes set by the min/max section, but then added to the channel that you selected to edit.<br>So eg, if there are triggers on channel 2, you could put a delay over it, adding delays to the original triggering of the sound, or add a delayed sound from another midichannel after the trigger<br>Each time you trigger the delay input, it will add these delays to the internal sequence to the selected channel (be careful though, this works exponentially if you just keep copying the same sequence)</p>

        <p>hmm ..<br>first i thought the order was 0-15 ext 16- 31 int,<br>than i discovered the output(int/ext) is detemined by the port button. is it?<br>anyway while recording, you must choose the right output with the port inlet.<br>However the order of the other buttons (mute solo scale)<br>is vice versa to the edit row. <br>Also i managed the second channel only by setting the midi send of my keyboard to chn 2,     wich would be better for me with only channel 1. my B200 crashes , and i am not able to change channel without power off. best would be another inlet choosing the behavior .<br>The delay works now ,with a momentary button ,but copied to non active edit channels. and all of them ,not the part  wich was active.<br>Also disconnected with<br>file error: FR_NO_FILE, filename:"0:/polyxl2/0:/scalebnksm.tab"</p>

        <p>Yes, the port button controls which port to select.<br>It's a good idea to just go to "edit code" and check the descriptions of the inlets.<br>There I also explained that the channel that gets delayed/copied, is the channel that is active. The channel that the delay actually goes to is set with the "toChnloffset" selector, which adds or subtracts it's value from the channel that is selected with the edit-bar. So if edit is on for ext-channel 2 up to 4 with the offset set to 6, it will copy/delay the 3 sequences to channel 8 to 10 respectively.  Using the from min/max and the to min/max inputs you can select from which part of the sequence you want to copy and to where (and also stretch it if the width is different). It's a good idea to more or less quantize these values to your clock-rate, so you have quick entry to useful start/end positions.</p>

<p>The error comes from that it tries to load a scalebank file. Have you used my scalebank generators? These create a bank of scales on you SDcard, which are then loaded by the polyXL module. Not sure which one it was, but it's a good idea to just load these generator modules once, so the scales are on the SDcard for later use.</p>

<p>Oh, and I just noticed that there are some things missing on the module that's in the library.. guess it's not the latest version..<br>I shall sync the second version (polymidiXL2), which should have the right setup for those edit/solo/mute/scale bars (each channel is then also scaleable or not) and enable them to be set using midi-controls.</p>

<p>This is the file in which I made/used it, it's still embedded, so maybe you want to interchange it with the polymidiXL2 module which I just uploaded. It also has the scale7generator in the patch to show how to use it (should be able to be swapped with the scale7bank after running the patch once)<br><a class="attachment" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/5/55287f16b0d5a2d4811f186a0202f9e83ad20859.axp">poly recorder alone.axp</a> (47.0 KB)</p>

<p>"pianobar"<br>"pianoDecoder"<br>"pianoMemory" </p>

<p>A 16-step 5-octave chainable pianobar sequencer with 3 velocity levels. <br>In itself able to do 72 voice polyphony, though, of course, depending on the synthesizer you control.<br>When the velocity changes while a note is already on,  a retrigger is given, if velocity stays the same, gate will be sustained.<br>The pianoDecoder gets the "notes" buffer and decodes it into midi.<br>Each velocity level can be given it's own automable velocity value and midi-channel output so the sequencer can also be used to write seperate sequences in one and mix them together using velocity levels.</p>

<p>Tables can be saved/loaded using the table save/load modules.<br>But I've just also added the "pianoMemory" module that loads/saves up to 8 modules at once.</p>

        <p>I did find back the patches where I editted them, but the modules themselves seem to have been deleted.<br>Though I did a quick retry just now and it doesn't seem to be very useful.<br>The modes have to be loaded from startup, so you can't change to different modes in a single module while being live.<br>So you could very well just load the module you want to use.<br>Perhaps an edit would be useful, making them able to go (in-)active, saving up cpu, but you'll still use lots of memory to store all the oscillator codes.</p>

        <p>DRUM TABLE FILE FOR DOWNLOAD:<br><a class="attachment" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/3/309108fce23c00dbcd3132654a15395228364ef4.axo">Dseq001.axo</a> (2.2 MB)</p>

<p>You have to rename this file to work:<br>Dseq001.tab<br>(it's the .tab part that's important, name it whatever you like for the other part)</p>

<p>This is a file containing 2913 pre-recorded midi drum sequences.<br>It's to be used with the dedicated drum-sequencer that I will upload shortly from now (just checking last things and adding info).<br>This file should be put on the SD-card in your axoloti and can be loaded with the normal, factory "table-load" and string modules. If put in the main folder, you would load from 0:/Dseq001.tab (or put it in a folder, wherever you want..)<br>The load module should refer to the drumsequencer which contains the actual table.</p>

<p>This is one powerful drumsequencer, containing 8 channels of 2913 sequences (basskick, kick, tom, snare, openHH, closedHH, cymbal, percussion).<br>Each of the sequencer outputs (also a "voice" next to the 8 drumchannels) can select it's own channel to get it's gate-sequence and select it's own sequence-preset out of the 2913 sequences. So a LOT of combinations are possible.<br>In the table, there are loads of different rhythms for all kinds of genres, all to be combined to new ones.</p>

<p>An extra module will be provided to make the best use of the possibilities.<br>This will select a base-rhythm for eg. the kick and when a trigger comes in for variation, it will look for another rhythm that resembles the base-rhythm. A difference-parameter sets the amount in which it might differ from the base rhythm.<br>This module can also receive a trigger for a new base, copying the currently selected preset-number to the base-parameter, allowing for a continuous change for all your channels.<br>Testing it out with tekno..well.. it's just awesome.. <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>FILTER<br>"firRND"<br>A randomised FIR-filter coëfficient generator.<br>Two ways of randomisation:<br>-pattern: 16 filter presets that can be stepped through using the seq-input.

        <p>NEW MODULES</p>

<p>SEQ<br>"baseq"</p>

<p>Basic drumpattern generator containing 2913 different drum patterns of 8 channels each.<br>THIS TABLE-FILE HAS TO BE DOWNLOADED FIRST! -&gt; See two posts above this one "drum table"<br>Use a "table/load" module to load the file into the baseq sequencer.<br>Each drumchannel or the voice channel can select it's own sequence channel and pattern preset, but in normal use the channel-selection is expected to be ordered index 0-7 for chn1 to chn8.<br>p1 to p8 select the preset for the respective channel<br>chn1 to chn8 selects which channel of that preset is used to generate gates<br>Each of the outputs can be muted with a high-gate on the respective mute inputs.</p>

<p>This sequencer can be used with a couple of other modules for selecting presets/channels. As there are 2913 "base" rhythms and each of the 9 channel outputs can select it's own preset ánd channel from the preset, millions of combinations are possible.<br>Though, as the presets come from midi-files found on the internet and unchecked, some are not really useful for "base" rhythms, but more for quick/short variations. The following modules provide a bit more control over having a base-rhythm and adding variations.</p>

<p>The trigger outputs are fractional outputs which give a 1-sample trigger for each gate. The amplitude of this trigger has the value of the velocity. To use this you could:<br>-sample&amp;hold this value with each trigger and multiply this with the envelope<br>-use one of my envelopes that features a fractional input<br>-if no velocity is needed, use a input&gt;c module to generate boolean triggers<br>-embed a decay-envelope and change the (1&lt;&lt;27) reset value with "inlet_trig" and change the trig inlet into fractional type.</p>

<p>PATT<br>"basePatt"</p>

<p>Pattern generator that normally outputs the "base" value and having a chance that it's randomly changed. This can be either as a random-pattern (count input) or ongoing randomly generated.<br>Amount of different random values can be set as well as a difference size (offset from base).<br>Checking the "nonseed" box will use non-repeating random values instead the randomised pattern, basically setting the "differents" to unlimited.<br>Nice to use with the "Baseq" sequencer.</p>

<p>SEQ<br>"basearch"<br>Dedicated pattern selector/finder for the "baseq" sequencer.<br>-Select a base pattern to base the search on.<br>-Select on which channel in the pattern you want to base your search on.<br>-Select how different a newly found pattern may be from your base-pattern.<br>The search/generate controls:<br>"next" searches for the next pattern that's similar enough to the base pattern.<br>"new" copies the currently selected pattern to the base-pattern-value to start it's next search based on this new pattern.<br>"rnd" chooses a random pattern as long as it's high. When low, goes back to the selected pattern.</p>

<p>When you change the "base" pattern it changes it's current preset to the new base pattern and you can start your search from there.<br>Useful to know: use the "new" trigger for all channels except the kick (output 2) to make sure your kick-rhythm stays within the bounds of your genre. All other channels can be happily triggered every once in a while to provide your song with endless variation <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>Cool modules! I would really love to utilise ctrlrec16, but I'm having an issue... All outputs send the same data, regardless of the channel setting. Sending a different channel number to the channel input appears to do nothing. Is it possible to record 16 individual knob movements simultaneously?</p>

        <p>no, you can only record 2 knobs at the same time. Something like a XY-controller would function best for this, even better when it has an extra gate for if you touch the xy-pad to control the "rec" with.<br>I've just checked it myself, seems to work correct to me. You've probably have a wrong setting somewhere.<br>-is there a square-LFO connected to the trigger input?<br>-wrong value at the "steps" input? (perhaps try to leave this unconnected)<br>-the "rec" should be high as long as you want to record. This also sets the length of the recording. When using overdub, it leaves the length as it was, just overwriting the recorded data at the position.</p>

        <p>It is recording and playing back correctly, I am just confused about the function of the 16 outputs. Should the recorded motion of the two inputs be coming out through all outputs simultaneously, as they are in my case? If so, what is an intended use case for them, rather than just using one outlet?</p>

        <p>it should not come out simultanuously..<br>You select the output-channels to which you want to record the 2 CV inputs.<br>It should then only record the incoming CV to the ones you've selected.<br>I did find that I forgot to reset the entire array, only channel 1 was reset and the others start up with random values. I should have fixed that now.<br>If it still ain't working, I'm wondering what you're doing wrong.. it's working perfectly overhere..</p>

that gets delayed/copied, is the channel that is active. The channel that the delay actually goes to is set with the \"toChnloffset\" selector, which adds or subtracts it's value from the channel that is selected with the edit-bar. So if edit is on for ext-channel 2 up to 4 with the offset set to 6, it will copy/delay the 3 sequences to channel 8 to 10 respectively.  Using the from min/max and the to min/max inputs you can select from which part of the sequence you want to copy and to where (and also stretch it if the width is different).
