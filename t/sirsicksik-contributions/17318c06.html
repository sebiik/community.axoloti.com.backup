        <p>Your audio repeater module is fantastic!</p>

<p>How would I go about modifying it to implement the following (I'm new to axoloti but somewhat experienced with coding):</p>

<ul>
<li>add a boolean inlet. When it is low the fx is bypassed. When high the fx starts repeating immediately, until the inlet goes low.</li>
<li>this would render the Repeats field unnecessary</li>
<li>instead of it a field (or a dial/inlet) to set the ratio between the buffer size and the repeat size</li>
</ul>

<p>I realise it is not a trivial change to the object, but maybe you could point me in the right direction. I'd really appreciate it. Thank you</p>

        <p>the "on" input already does the bypassing when it is off.<br>if you set the repeats value really high, it will keep repeating the same part for as long as the "on" input is high</p>

<p>you set the "size" using my "clock2timing" module in my "timing" folder to sync it to a midi clock or LFO, then use my ratioVCAI (math folder) to set the ratio to this frequency.<br>You could use this ratioVCAI also to set these ratio's that you want.</p>

        <p>pfieuw, yesterday a new project crashed and I lost the code of the new module (forgot to save haha), but luckily I managed to rewrite the module this morning quickly again.<br>I already wrote some polyphonic midi recording modules, but the problem was that all the data was recorded "realtime", so a gate of 4 beats length at 4/4 measure would take 16 positions in an array, just for a single note...</p>

<p>instead of this, the new module will read an incoming "count" and save that into an array together with the note, velocity and duration info. This way:<br>-each played note will just take 4 positions in the array (might be able to add more data-per-note, by incorporating midiCC, touch and bend info, taking a few more positions for each played note).<br>-probably it's possible to not even record polyphonically, but also multi-midichannel!<br>-almost unlimited notes can be stacked up at the same read-position (limited by synth polyphony, yesterday I easily drove 16 voices, adding multiple midichannels would allow to play more then 16 voices (check-&gt;synts/simpleguitar))<br>-sequences can be ANY length, it's only limited to the amount of notes being played within the time set (currently 1024, but this could be set really high, enabling sequences of hours/days-&gt;though this might need an extra layer of counting..).<br>-you could record/convert midi-drum-sequences from your daw to the axoloti<br>-the sequencer could cope with timestamp-based positions, following the play-position of your DAW</p>

<p>stil busy on it, but should be available soon!</p>

        <p><a class="mention" href="../../users/sirsicksik.html">@SirSickSik</a><br>that sounds amazing!!!! could be a real game changer for the axoloti <img src="../../images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile30f4.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> <br>I might wanna add that it would be extremly great if one could you this indeed as note recorder but also access it via a (melodic) step sequencer like interface, like with the ableton push for example. That way you could choose how you enter notes, either by playing, by sequencing or you could maybe edit played notes.</p>

        <p>I was thinking about paypall, as it's the only one I'm familiar with.. though, not that it worked that great.. <br>till now I actually got 3x 1 eurocent and one time 5 euro over a time of 6 years... and I made that in the first month...<br>it's just... I've put over 50 hours of my music on the internet, 500+ vst plugins, 400 axoloti modules for free and allowed donations... and well, it got me €5,03 over 14 years... wow hahahaha</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, I would be happy to donate <img src="../../images/emoji/emoji_one/wink30f4.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> You helped me out personally in several cases and I dont mind contributing. Let us know what you come up with? Paypal? </p>

<p>Though I havent made any money from music made with Axoloti..... YET... I will till be happy to contribute. </p>

<p>Brainfart thoughts:<br>I have personally release 2 "split albums" with friends and more than 20 tracks on different compilations. I have not really ever been able to live 100% from it, but it have certainly helped to get some nice pocket money, new gear and on top of that a lot of gigs around the world, like India, Nepal, Russia, Brazil, Israel, Marocco, Japan and so on. Lots of free travel <img src="../../images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile30f4.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  But ONLY cause I did something to make it happen. I have many friends who makes better music than I do, but they never did anything to get the jobs and releases and so on. So I'd definetely try to "make a name of myself"....</p>

<p>But maybe start making a commercial business out of it? Write plug ins, etc.? You clearly got the skills to do so. Really like your music too <img src="../../images/emoji/emoji_one/wink30f4.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> </p>

<p>What about sending your music to different labels, see what they think? And so on........ I think in these times, where everyone with a computer can make proffesional sounding mixes, you really have to do something about it, if you want to get noticed and make a business out of it. Cause when there are so many, there is a lot of competition, and therefor the ones who goes far to get people to listen to their music are the ones who gets noticed. I remember when I started making music. I was on Napster, finding people who had similar music to the style I wrote, and sending music to them. It took a while to "get a name", but I succeded within the genre I worked in at that time. But I really had to work hard for it.</p>

<p>Anyway I have loads of more ideas for Axolotis objects. I hope your helpful soul doesnt dissapear from here. And if a donation is an incentive to keep you in Axoloti forum, I will donate <img src="../../images/emoji/emoji_one/wink30f4.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

        <p>currently trying to find a way to instantly find the right reading position if a new sequence is loaded as it now sometimes has to restart first before the new sequence gets played (and not playing any notes till the count restarts). Also to be able to just start anywhere in a sequence, when using a DAW.<br>The way of recording/playing does make this a bit more complicated..</p>

<p>8minutes later...<br>oh that was easier than I thought.. XD<br>though I must say you can hear a very short soft bleep when loading a new sequence. When timed right, it's unnoticable and for your ears could count a a "pluck" of a voice.</p>

<p>To remove the blib, try <a class="mention" href="../../users/drjustice.html">@DrJustice</a> deglitcher object! It removes the blibs that occurs when loading a table and other situations, for that matter. It mutes the output of the Axo patch!

        <p>well, I don't think there any need for that..<br>the blip occured when using a sequence length of 1024 for a 64beat-length sequence.. 256 would probably be far enough to make sequences, while being able to load them without a blip. The sequence I played only had like 96 notes in it and is pretty full already.<br>remember, the array-sequence length is independent of the duration of the sequence, it only stores the notes that are actually played.</p>

        <p>damn, I might actually found a VERY interesting way of sequencing.. all kinds of easy moddings can be done on the sequencer like beat-quantification, generating/randomising swing on a live-recorded sequence, transposing/deleting/attenuating/displacing only certain notes, etc etc</p>

<p>That sounds indeed VERY VERY interesting <img src="../../images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile30f4.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I was just wondering, would it be possible to start with no clock with the first loop and then set the clock according to the length of the first recording? Like with classical loop stations, only in this case with midi looping. I couldnt figure out how to do this with patching recording into tables AND have all the step editing possibilities..</p>

        <p>this recorder just reads which "position" your count is in and as soon as the count is at a recorded play-position of some recorded note, it will play that recorded note,<br>The input count resets the reading of the available notes when it restarts at zero, so you could manipulate the count to only count as far as your record goes (would need some extra external modules to do this). Eg. I used a "divremc" module to limit my count to 64 beats from a 24fps clock.. This makes it repeat the saved sequence every 64 measures.(though I made a tiny miscalculation here in the current code, which shall change..)<br>So, it shouldn't really matter how long your recorded sequence is, as long as your count-input is limited/wrapped to some value, which you can control externally by any counting module, you could restart at a new position. So if you make a patch with some latch modules, you could save what time you started your recording and what time you ended it. A (often positively) quantification of this time should give the size of the length of the recording (set this as max value of a counter for example)).<br>I'm trying to keep the module as "clean" as possible. For any further applications external modules should be used, I'll try to build in as many usable functions in it, that really have to be performed within the program (otherwise not possibe or taking too much cpu), while still keeping the modularity intact..</p>
