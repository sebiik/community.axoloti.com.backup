<blockquote><p>Can you have floating point numbers that are not pitches or frequencies?</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>do you mean real floating point, or the integer form we use in patches (blue cables)?<br> yes, floats are used in lots of places, e.g. amplitudes, analog in from gpio... <br>in fact, they are used more than ints (green)</p>

<p><aside class="quote"><blockquote><p>How can I add displays to a subpatch? have booleans, numbers, notes etc displayed on the control panel</p></blockquote></aside></p>

<p>put on parent</p>

<p><aside class="quote"><blockquote><p>How long is a trigger pulse?</p></blockquote></aside></p>

<p>one k-rate cycle</p>

<p><aside class="quote"><blockquote><p>How fast can logic go, what is the minimum pulse length?</p></blockquote></aside></p>

<p>the logic objects are k-rate , so 3khz</p>

<p><aside class="quote"><blockquote><p>How do I add tool tips to controls in a subpatch?</p></blockquote></aside></p>

<p>they use the parameter description</p>

<p><aside class="quote"><blockquote><p>How fast does the user interface refresh?</p></blockquote></aside></p>

<p>I'm not sure what you mean by refresh, as it doesn't refresh as such.<br>the values are pushed from the board to the UI whenever they are changed.<br>(actually, I think there may be a throttle, as I seem to remember a polling cycle, but id have to go check)</p>

<p>perhaps some contexts for the questions might help elicit better answers.</p>

        <p>Cheers, that's cleared up a few things already</p>

<p>Sorry for the lack of context, I'm busy and didn't have time to go into much detail when it didn't seem entirely neccesary</p>

<p>Display objects have no option to put on parent that I can find in the subpatch editor, perhaps I am doing something wrong.</p>

<p>Logic runs at k rate, cool thanks.</p>

<p>parameter description, in object definition dialog?<br>think i found it.</p>

<p>Ok, floating point numbers, this might require some context.</p>

<p>So I am trying to set a clock rate based on a BPM input, easy enough I thought divide bpm by 60 and that should give you the frequency in hertz, multiply to fastest note needed (4 or 8 times) then plug into lfo pitch control and out comes your master base clock, no such luck. <br>First I couldn't find an object that divides two integers and produces a float, then couldn't find a way to display a float as a number to try and debug the patch, then a float applied to the factory square wave lfo with logic output doesn't set the frequency just changes the rate set by the knob.</p>

<p>I am using the factory logic lfo as a clock now but it's not how I want it to work and would like to be able to set a tempo in bpm and use that to control the frequency of the base master clock accurately.</p>

<p>sorry, misread as parameters, no you can't do that currently</p>

<p>bpm input... sorry don't have time to go into this in detail..<br>I'm pretty sure a few have done similar things in the community library, perhaps have a search there.</p>

        <p>The community library objects that have BPM that i have looked at so far do not produce anything like accurate timing.</p>

<p>I've come across quite a few community objects that don't work at all or don't work as expected or as described.</p>

<p>I'd rather build my own anyway that way i understand how it works and I learn from the experience, I'm in this project for the long haul and in a few years I hope to know it thoroughly.</p>
