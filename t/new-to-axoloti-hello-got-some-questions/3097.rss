    <title>New to axoloti, hello! Got some questions</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/new-to-axoloti-hello-got-some-questions/3097</link>
    <description>Hello everyone,

I want to order my first Axoloti in about 2 day&#39;s. Only now it seems I can only pay with a credit card, and paypall didn&#39;t work :S

But about the board, I&#39;ve read a lot of things already, but I can&#39;t seem to find out wich type of potentiometer I need to use to work well with the board. 

Thanks in advance</description>

              <p>hi, and welcome<br>billing etc, your best to DM <a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> directly if there is an issue.</p>

<p>pots - I think most use 10k Linear, see <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/official-pin-out-ports-documentation/202/14">this post</a> for some suggestions.... also you can search the forum, and you'll find more suggestions.</p>

<p>EDIT: btw, make sure you also have some header pins (details in above post)  as the axo board is 'bare' and you don't want to be soldering directly to the board. (male or female is personal choice, just get the matching jumper cables)</p>
