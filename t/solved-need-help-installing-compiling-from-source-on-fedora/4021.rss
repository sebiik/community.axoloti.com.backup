    <title>[SOLVED] Need help installing / compiling from source on Fedora</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/solved-need-help-installing-compiling-from-source-on-fedora/4021</link>
    <description>edit: I solved the problem. So for the protocol: Compiling The Axoloti Patcher on Fedora works.
The patcher has to be cloned using the git command (downloading does not work). 
Also during the build there is some file (chibiOS) not downloaded due to the server location having been changed (apparently). This can be solved by downloading the correct version manually and placing it in the right folder (platform_linux/src/ ).

Hi, the day before yesterday my Axoloti arrived, but I am still not able to install the patcher programm.
I have Fedora (Linux) 26. I tried the GUIX install, but I cannot install this guix thing. There is only some third party implementations apparently on copr. 
I tried to install it using the website of guix, but this didn&#39;t work either. What contributes to the problem is, that I have no idea what guix really is and why i have to run so many commands. some of these commands just don&#39;t end in anything. 

So i tried to compile axoloti patcher from source which works well until i get some error that has to do with chibiOS.zip. apparently this chibios.zip file isn&#39;t an archive or something. 
In the build.sh there is some mentioning of Fedora, so the build should (at least theoretically) work on fedora, right?

Are there some alternative things i could try?

Any help would be appreaciated!</description>

<p>Hello, I'm having issues installing on ArchLinux using <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/axoloti/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/axoloti/</a> because it depends on the ChibiOS .zip file, whose URL is no longer valid. I can't find it anywhere on the internet either. Any suggestions of where to find it or an alternative way to install this in Arch?</p>

<p>IT WORKS! Thank you guys!</p>

<p>Now I'll go to bed and think about what I'll build tomorrow with it. <br>Also in retrospect I was just a little stupid. For the protocol the build on Fedora works, just the chibliOS has to be downloaded manually and placed in the platform_linux/src folder. <br>Also don't copy the repo, clone it using the git command. <br>Maybe I'll update my post with that info?</p>

<p>you should use git clone to download the repository, not just download the source.<br>eg.<br></p>

<p></p><pre><code class="lang-auto">git clone https://github.com/axoloti/axoloti
git checkout 1.0.12</code></pre>

<p>(its important to checkout 1.0.12 , otherwise the versions for the community and factory library will be wrong) </p>

<p>JDK, if you have 1.8 installed thats fine.<br>the Oracle JDK is only needed if you want to build the application, which in your case you dont need.</p>

<p>I dont know if there are any issues with OpenJDK 1.8 (or 1.7) , as far as my testing went it seemed to be fine.<br>but I will say most users are using Windows/MacOS and these both use the Oracle Java.</p>

<p>anyway for now, Id say try with the JDK you have, it should be fine</p>

              <p>which branch are you using? <br>you should try to use the 1.0.12 tag</p>

<p>you need to run platform_linux/build.sh... and it should go collect everything it needs.</p>

<p>I only ever build on Ubuntu, (which is why I list it as 'supported')</p>

<p>but someone from the community has added fedora to the build.sh, so I assume they tested it and got it working... but I dont know, hence cant support it (I dont have a fedora dist installed) . <br>Im sure if it needs fixing , its probably small.. <br>(build.sh is actually a very simple script, that just downloads and unzips everything it needs) </p>

<p>first thing I would check is that its 'detecting fedora correctly.</p>

<p>as for errors, you need to be specific, what is the exact error message you get?<br>also we'd need to see the entire output from build.sh (e.g. so we can see if its detecting Fedora or not)</p>

<p>... so perhaps redirect the output to a file, and then post it somewhere where it can be downloaded</p>

<p>btw: also make sure you have java working , and that its  Java 1.8... as discussed in install guides.</p>

              <p>edit: I solved the problem. So for the protocol: Compiling The Axoloti Patcher on Fedora works.<br>The patcher has to be cloned using the git command (downloading does not work). <br>Also during the build there is some file (chibiOS) not downloaded due to the server location having been changed (apparently). This can be solved by downloading the correct version manually and placing it in the right folder (platform_linux/src/ ).</p>

<p>Hi, the day before yesterday my Axoloti arrived, but I am still not able to install the patcher programm.<br>I have Fedora (Linux) 26. I tried the GUIX install, but I cannot install this guix thing. There is only some third party implementations apparently on copr. <br>I tried to install it using the website of guix, but this didn't work either. What contributes to the problem is, that I have no idea what guix really is and why i have to run so many commands. some of these commands just don't end in anything. </p>

<p>So i tried to compile axoloti patcher from source which works well until i get some error that has to do with chibiOS.zip. apparently this chibios.zip file isn't an archive or something. <br>In the build.sh there is some mentioning of Fedora, so the build should (at least theoretically) work on fedora, right?</p>

<p>Are there some alternative things i could try?</p>

<p>Any help would be appreaciated!</p>
