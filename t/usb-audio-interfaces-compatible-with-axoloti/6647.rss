    <description>Is it known to be possible to connect a usb audio interface to an Axoloti to allow additional audio in and outs? If this is not working now, is it something that could work in the future?</description>

              <p>I love that haptic/vibrating metronome idea. That could solve all this, and leave my stereo effects and sound in tact. I was thinking more about it and I think I can design the signal flow so that I have control over which of the two inputs goes to either of the two outputs, so I will dedicate on side as a mono monitor out and the other as the main mix out, also mono. With 4 knobs I can at least control where the internally processed sounds flow as a balance between left and right outs, and it I add 4 more knobs I can control how the inputs are treated as well, 8 knobs would be just for routing but super powerful. Thank you for your suggestions, it helped to get me thinking more clearly about it.</p>

              <p>I guess you are using the Axoloti outputs for something else too that's why you want an extra output ?<br>This would be a dirty hack but it might work.. you could use some gpio pins as extra output,  just for click track.  you could use the audio or you could connect also a vibrating motor from a cellphone  and having attached to your body.  a bit like the soundbrenner thing works.  ..   OR you could just buy another axoloti that at the end it's still cheaper than most decent soundcards..</p>

              <p>Thank you for your reply. It makes sense too, I just wasn't sure if this was something that might be possible. I have two projects in mind, and while I have some free time just trying to decide which one to tackle first. One will be a simple metronome/clock device that will give me an in-ear beat and send midi clock to my loopers. I do very ambient non-rhythmic parts usually first, but want to make sure they are aligned to the grid so as I bring rhythmic elements in they will align nicely. So, what I am thinking is I will create a default beat that can be controlled by a midi controller like the nanoKontrol2. The faders can adjust the volume of the elements that make up the whole sound, as well as effects levels, so I would have one channel feed my headphone/in ear monitors, and the other could actually go to the live/recording system so it will be easy to bring the rhythmic elements in. I want to explore probability as a way to take the basic beat and add more variety and interest, so some of the knobs of the nanoKontrol could serve as other variables, sub-divisions, etc.. I'm choosing the Axoloti because it already has midi and audio i/o and is so compact, as this will be living on my pedalboard. So, one more question, unrelated to the OT, can can the Axoloti power a midi controller such as the nanoKontrol2?</p>

              <p>While not 100% impossible it is extremely unlikely that such functionality would ever come to Axoloti.</p>

<p>Just think about the number of cycles needed to set this up (not to mention any compatibility issues with non class-compliant devices). It would basically render any real Axoloti functionality impossible.</p>

<p>I do remember <a class="mention" href="/u/johannes">@johannes</a> mention that it could be possible to connect multiple axoloti's together and share a couple lanes of audio streams between each other, but this is not under active development afaik.</p>
