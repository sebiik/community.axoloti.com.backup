        <p>After perusing the various eurorack related threads it seems to me that the flexibility of what the Axoloti can do makes it hard to pin it down to a single ideal realisation as a Eurorack module. I quite liked the Euxoloti idea but as I read further into it felt it was a bit too complex. </p>

<p>I wonder if the expandable capability of the Music Thing Turing Machine, or the Expert Sleepers Disting might be a model for a good way to integrate the Axoloti into Eurorack. </p>

<p>Essentially the core module would be simply integrated in its power supply,  the board would be split into two and the existing boards exposed to the world in a 'Core' Eurorack module that is not fully 'eurorack' integrated but just conveniently mounted and powered. It would however carry a header PCB that exposed its pinouts as expansion headers.  The 'Core' could take on different personalities simply by booting up different patches from the SD card. </p>

<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/0e07663fc11f8526718c05f0117eee46e01e9775" href="https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0e07663fc11f8526718c05f0117eee46e01e9775.jpg" class="lightbox" title="Axo.jpg"><img src="http://community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/0e07663fc11f8526718c05f0117eee46e01e9775_1_386x500.jpg" width="386" height="500"><div class="meta">
<span class="filename">Axo.jpg</span><span class="informations">1275x1650 288 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>
</div></a></div></p>

<p>Note that because Axoloti supports some of the Mutable Instruments algos, it could then effectively be sold as a way of getting a few of those into Eurorack which would in itself be a market. </p>

<p>Then a wider variety of DIY expansion modules could provide I/O and other UX.  So suppose you could have two expansion headers one for UX and one for I/O.  Each of those would only need a small PCB for the interfacing hardware eg: for voltage conversion.  So they as whole would make very easy to build DIY kits.  I've sketched these as AXO-IO and AXO-UI</p>

<p>For many musicians, even the UX needed to create patches on Axoloti could be a bit challenging, so for them, precreated patches on the SD card could make the Axoloti available as a meta module capable like the Disting of changing its nature depending on what patch is loaded from the SD card. </p>

<p>A small UI on the front of the Axoloti Core module could then be used along with a simple cursor button to loop through the list of patches on the SD card. </p>

<p>I think a big benefit of this concept could be of creating a module market for the board, and might then provide the economic impetus to expand and develop the concept further.</p>

        <p>This has been discussed quite a few times , in various forms....</p>

<p>I think only have a few have done it for a few reasons: </p>

<p>a) Axoloti is cheap , and Eurorack is expensive <br>so the markets don't overlap as much as we might think... there are a few of use with Eurorack, but are there enough to justify it?<br>Ive spoken to Johannes on this, and its didn't really seem to excite him, he designed Axoloti much more for the DIY/hacker market, as an affordable board - and eurorack is not that.<br>(of course, he'd be happy if someone worked in partnership with him to build a eurorack module) </p>

<p>b) complexity creep <br>so its easy to just create a module where Axoloti is powered from Eurorack,</p>

<p>but then complexities start creeping in....<br>audio out needs scaling up  to modular levels<br>audio in needs scaling down from modular level</p>

<p>cv in -&gt; analog in, needs scaling ... and you need to take care of connecting in - in<br>cv out... there are only 2 analog outs, and you'd probably want more, so this means not only scaling, but converting digital  outs using an additional DAC, (or a simple PWM / RC combo( ?)) ... and then protection against someone connecting an output to your cv output.</p>

<p>c) protection <br>ok, I could do most of (b) with a few op-amps, but what would worry me most, is that if its not properly protected, I could easily damage the axoloti board  (accidentally connecting an out to an out) , or even worst damaging an expensive eurorack module!  is that really worth the risk?</p>

<p>( i.e. i have the confidence I could hack this to make it work, but I dont have the electrical engineering expertise to do it properly... and so might damage something) </p>

<hr>

<p>I dunno, for me, its seems like theres not much of a commercial market - and its a bit too much for me to take on as a DIY project (though Ive considered it multiple times) </p>

<p>I even found this with Bela (which actually is easier to convert to Eurorack) , but I still ended up buying Salt (made by Rebel Tech/Bela built on Bela tech) because it felt 'safer' </p>

<p>also lets remember there are already 'flexible' eurorack modules out there e.g. ardcore, nebulae , o&amp;c  </p>

<p>for these reasons, Ive not really pursued eurorack connectivity, rather I have been exploring Axoloti with AE modular....</p>

<h3><a href="http://forum.aemodular.com/thread/32/axoloti-connectivity" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Axoloti connectivity  | AE Modular</a></h3>

<p>So before I started on the BelaMini module,  I actually had started on a different project for connecting to AE modular,  connecting Axoloti!  this is not finished but as I had the</p>

  <div class="onebox-metadata">
    
    
  </div>
  <div style="clear: both"></div>
</aside>


<p>I like AE modular, because its cheaper, and this makes it much more 'DIY friendly' , and I think this fits really well with Axoloti. <br>The reason I haven't 'finished' it off... is that the axoloti board is a little big for AE modular - so I've been struggling to decide the best approach  (external box? 5HP wide module?)</p>

<p>... I might give it another go soon though, as I recently did a arduino based module for AE, and that came out pretty well, and makes me encouraged to finish of the Axoloti project.</p>

<hr>

<p>all that said, now Ive been exploring AE DIY modules more, and also building a few DIY eurorack kits, </p>

<p>I'd probably be more likely to try a Eurorack Axoloti project in the future - so never say never <img src="http://community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>That is very helpful.  Your point about damaging gear is a very good one, I envisaged the expansion units having a board in there to provide circuit protection. Also I saw this as mainly a DIY thing, similar to the Music Thing Modular kits or board/panel partial kits. </p>

<p>For me Eurorack is too expensive, but there are so many modules available, and the DIY potential that it makes it interesting.  </p>

<p>I may be happy to just physically host the Axoloti in the rack I have bought as its currently empty and if I end up with 2 or three, it would keep them organised, even if it doesn't directly interface with the eurorack bits I plan to get other than via midi. </p>

<p>Also I didn't know about the ardcore, nebulae etc.</p>

        <p>Seems to me... that there’s no real reason to convert an Axoloti to EuroRack. Designing a new STM32 F4 (or better) board with appropriate I/O and dimensions makes more sense.</p>
