    <title>Physical input stuck to mono (right input only)</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/physical-input-stuck-to-mono-right-input-only/7513</link>
    <description>I bought a board a while ago from somebody else and I just noticed that the input is only read from the physical right audio input, which then shows up as both left and right input in the editor..
The left input does nothing..
Is there some mod somewhere, that has been used by the previous user, that changes how the axoloti receives inputs??</description>

At first I thought it was just this new board I bought, but at the end I found out that suddenly, all my boards acted this way..</p>

<p>Only other thing I can think of would be a bad/half broken cable between your axoloties (if I read your posts correctly, you were testing across boards, right?) that is now in a functional state again.</p>

<p>I seriously don't understand what could have changed.. it would be pretty weird if I have made the same mistake for several weeks and now suddenly do something different and right while thinking I'm doing the same thing..</p>

              <p>at this point i think it is some magic from johannes, that if no source is connected (i.e. the input is mono) the stereo input automagically switches to mono (in the sense of both stereo channels receive the same signal) from a user perspective this would make sense, since it can be hard to know which input is which on a stereo cable...</p>

              <p>seriously, this makes no sense at all....<br>I got all 3 input modules in the same patch, 2 mono and 1 stereo. They're all reading the same buffers called <br>"AudioInputLeft[j]" and "AudioInputRight[j]", but while in the same patch, the mono input doés receive the left input, the stereo input only receives the right one... So while they're reading the same buffers, they're getting different results?!?!?!</p>

<p>ps. it's even weirder then I thought...it's not the board itself.. I just tried it out with another board and it's doing the same thing wrong... Changed cable, same problem. Changed the output board, same problem. Changed the input board, same problem..</p>

              <p>yes, but I don't think it's a hardware problem. If it would be the case that the left input just isn't working, the left input in the patcher should show no input instead of showing the right input, right?</p>

<p>And I just checked it using the two seperate mono input modules (left and right mono), which work correctly...<br>So the left audio input dóes work, but somehow just doesn't show up in the stereo input module....even while it's set to stereo with the config module...whaaaat?? <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/face_with_raised_eyebrow.png?v=5" title=":face_with_raised_eyebrow:" class="emoji" alt=":face_with_raised_eyebrow:"> <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/thinking.png?v=5" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:"></p>
