    <title>Object&#39;s Text Entry too small in Gnome</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/objects-text-entry-too-small-in-gnome/4920</link>
    <description>Hi,
I&#39;m using Axoloti Patcher on Linux (debian and ubuntu-based distros) with gnome-shell 3.28.3 and I have a problem with any object with a text entry such as wave/play or string/c. Basically, the text entries are all too small to actually view what text is being entered. They function normally but it is impossible to read text that&#39;s entered as it is squished down or cut off to like two or three pixels tall. I took a look at the &#39;edit object definition&#39; to see if I could change to size manually but I have found no obvious way to do it. Does anyone have any ideas? Is it perhaps a bug that needs to be fixed?
I don&#39;t have a problem editing the code myself but before I start tearing everything apart to make my own solution I&#39;d appreciate if anyone could point me in the right direction first.
Thank you in advance,
-Andrew</description>
