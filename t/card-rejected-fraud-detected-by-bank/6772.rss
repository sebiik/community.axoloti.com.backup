    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/card-rejected-fraud-detected-by-bank/6772</link>
    <description>I tried to order an axo last week and now my debit card is disabled :( I called the bank and they are sending me a new card. I couldn&#39;t really get many details about it, they just kept saying hackers might have been looking at my card details. Maybe it&#39;s something to do with https? the URL has &#39;not secure&#39; next to it in chrome instead of the padlock icon. Anyway, thought you&#39;d want to know...</description>

<p>Sorry, but services like letsencrypt cost nothing. Even a payed certificate (like I use) cost me less than 50 euro/year. This may never be the argument not to use https, especialy on European websites that communicatie personal data. <a href="https://www.geocerts.com/blog/how-does-ssl-fit-into-gdpr" rel="nofollow noopener">GDPR</a> states that use of encrypted communication when dealing with personal data is mandatory. So, Johannes is in violation of GDPR atm.</p>

              <p>I've ordered one myself in the past successfully, this would have been my second. I think the banking laws have changed in the UK recently. It's a Nationwide building society visa debit card. I only posted on here so Johannes could know about a potential problem. It's actually worked out great for me, I didn't know the AKSO had been released so I'll just order one of those.</p>

<p>I believe SSL certificates can be had for free from letsencrypt.</p>

<p>Edit...I paid with paypal</p>
