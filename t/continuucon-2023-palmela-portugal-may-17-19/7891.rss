    <description>Happy to announce and host in my town:

**ContinuuCon Electronic Music Conference Scheduled in Portugal**

ContinuuCon 2023, the fifth international Haken Continuum Conference, is slated for May 17–19 in Palmela, Portugal. This year’s focus will be on every electronic musical instrument that features the Continuum’s internal sound engine, the EaganMatrix. This includes the new Osmose synthesizer from French manufacturer Expressive E, as well as the Continuum Fingerboard, ContinuuMini, and EaganMatrix Module for Eurorack from Haken Audio. As in previous years, the conference extends opportunities for musicians, sound designers, software developers, and music enthusiasts to explore these uniquely expressive instruments through presentations, performances, and hands-on experience.

ContinuuCon 2023 will begin with an evening reception on May 17, just four days after Superbooth ends in Berlin. Over the next two days, Continuum and Osmose experts and master musicians will present lectures and demos at the Palmela Public Library. For tickets, information, and videos of past events, visit the website continuucon.com.

Over decades of collaboration, University of Illinois professor Dr. Lippold Haken and Canadian film and TV composer Edmund Eagan developed the EaganMatrix and the Continuum family of instruments. Both men will be on hand throughout the event, along with their counterparts from Expressive E and other authorities, to share their technical knowledge and musical expertise.

Previous Continuum conferences have been held at IRCAM in Paris and in Asheville, North Carolina. Haken Continuum players include Game of Thrones composer Ramin Djawadi, Brazilian electro-acoustic musician Amon Tobin, film composer A.R. Rahman, Dream Theater keyboardist Jordan Rudess, and The Who’s Pete Townshend, who said, “I absolutely adore it. The Continuum is already inspiring me to new ideas.”

**About Haken Audio’s Instruments**

The Continuum Fingerboard is a polyphonic electronic instrument that offers continuous multidimensional performance control by responding to each finger independently. The ContinuuMini is a smaller, more affordable duotactic model based on the same technology. Inside is the EaganMatrix, a user-programmable digital modular synthesizer taking full advantage of the supple playing surface’s myriad performance possibilities.

**About Palmela, Portugal**

About 25 miles from Lisbon, the city of Palmela features art, nature, heritage, gastronomy, award-winning wines, arts and crafts, and nearby, the beautiful beaches of the Arrábida, making it an excellent location for ContinuuCon. With the support of the Palmela City Council, Passos e Compassos is pleased to host ContinuuCon 2023.
