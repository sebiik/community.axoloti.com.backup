    <title>Axoloti Patcher GUI is unresponsive on windows 10?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/axoloti-patcher-gui-is-unresponsive-on-windows-10/3912</link>
    <description>Hi guys,
I&#39;m trying to set up the Axo patcher on my desktop pc. Had previously run it with no issues on my mac, but I&#39;m new to windows so not as good at debugging. I followed the instructions and installed the runtime folder and the .msi file. However, when I launch axoloti.exe, the patcher window comes up and doesn&#39;t respond to any mouse or keyboard input. None of the menus are clickable, and it also won&#39;t close the program. When terminated through Task Manager, it leaves behind a ghost &quot;Axoloti.exe (32 bit)&quot; background process that can&#39;t be terminated. 

Under device manager, I can see Axoloti Bulk interface on USB, and Axoloti Core on Software Devices. I&#39;m on Windows 10, using the latest axoloti release (10.0.12).

I saw some other folks had trouble with the unzip step and had to use winrar so I suppose next I&#39;ll just uninstall and try again from scratch. Also, I&#39;m not sure where to locate the logfiles on windows, so if anyone could point me there I&#39;d much appreciate it.</description>
