Here&#39;s a simple guitar amp and cab sim that&#39;s admittedly still a bit of a work in progress but still fully-functional. I was originally attempting something similar in my DAW but I found a lot of stock/freeware saturation plugins lacking when it came to fabricating an amp-like overdrive. While the Axoloti&#39;s soft clipping object isn&#39;t 1:1, it still sounds great to my ears by comparison, so I decided to flesh the concept out into this working prototype. Like any Axoloti guitar patch, a buffer between your guitar and the Core is highly recommended; mine is a stereo delay pedal so this patch here comes with stereo ins and outs standard, but you can also use it in mono just by using mono cables and/or by swapping out the stereo I/O objects for their mono counterparts. You don&#39;t have to do that second part, but it&#39;d let you delete the right channel objects as well, freeing up some CPU space for more objects if you&#39;d like.

Obviously do whatever you want with this, but there are two things I would recommend when using this. The first is to keep the high-pass filter and the second low-pass filter in each channel close to their present settings - they&#39;re doing a lot of the heavy lifting for providing basic cabinet emulation in conjunction with the second EQ objects. Go nuts with the first low-pass filter though - this is there as virtual tone pot for your guitar, allowing you to revoice the filter your tone knob and cable would otherwise make when you roll your guitar&#39;s tone pot down. Or you can set the CC on the frequency dial for expression pedal and use it like a wah - your choice.

The second is to keep the &quot;dry&quot; blend control, the last dial on the right split between both channels, down in the lower third of the range. Much further above that and you really lose the amp-ish (I won&#39;t go so far as to say amp-like) tone of the patch. Kept in the lower range, though, it can be used to add a bit of complexity, warmth, and/or fullness to your sound, good for &quot;smoothing&quot; out overdrive tones when you want them smooth. Otherwise, turning it down or off works well for more modern, punchier overdrive that&#39;s still technically soft clipping but doesn&#39;t sound too far off from outright distortion. Again, feel free to ignore this advice, but it&#39;s there if you want it.

That&#39;s it! Hope you enjoy messing around with this. Adding effects into this patch is both very possible and highly encouraged, I just wanted to post these building blocks in case anyone else had a need or want for a halfway-decent practice/headphone amp sim. Also I realize the gain and volume controls aren&#39;t coupled across the channels - that was 100% intentional and in no way due to me hastily duplicating the left channel objects to make this patch stereo. And yes, the name is silly.</description>

              <p>Thank you so much for this! This is an excellent counter to some of the tone loss that comes with running a guitar through Axo w/o having to deal with external buffers!</p>

              <p>I like it very much, !!<br>Plugged my bass into it... yes a decent bass od patch is my holy grail..<br>Of all the playing around for an OD type effect, I would have to say my style, this is great choice on the Axo I have found so far. I see the are alot of adjustments to play around with so interested to get that tube style added in, almost feels like its already there. I tried adding another HP section of you patch into the mix setting the pitch and reso high, not bad, but need to think about that one a bit more...<br>I can see now going for a amp / cab sim approach will definately give a different approach to a straight effect style which I have toyed with for ages...<br>I will look into any OD style patch if it can avoid me having to use an external pedal instead...!<br><img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/grin.png?v=5" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>
