<p>Here's a simple guitar amp and cab sim that's admittedly still a bit of a work in progress but still fully-functional. I was originally attempting something similar in my DAW but I found a lot of stock/freeware saturation plugins lacking when it came to fabricating an amp-like overdrive. While the Axoloti's soft clipping object isn't 1:1, it still sounds great to my ears by comparison, so I decided to flesh the concept out into this working prototype. Like any Axoloti guitar patch, a buffer between your guitar and the Core is highly recommended; mine is a stereo delay pedal so this patch here comes with stereo ins and outs standard, but you can also use it in mono just by using mono cables and/or by swapping out the stereo I/O objects for their mono counterparts. You don't have to do that second part, but it'd let you delete the right channel objects as well, freeing up some CPU space for more objects if you'd like.</p>

<p>Obviously do whatever you want with this, but there are two things I would recommend when using this. The first is to keep the high-pass filter and the second low-pass filter in each channel close to their present settings - they're doing a lot of the heavy lifting for providing basic cabinet emulation in conjunction with the second EQ objects. Go nuts with the first low-pass filter though - this is there as virtual tone pot for your guitar, allowing you to revoice the filter your tone knob and cable would otherwise make when you roll your guitar's tone pot down. Or you can set the CC on the frequency dial for expression pedal and use it like a wah - your choice.</p>

<p>The second is to keep the "dry" blend control, the last dial on the right split between both channels, down in the lower third of the range. Much further above that and you really lose the amp-ish (I won't go so far as to say amp-like) tone of the patch. Kept in the lower range, though, it can be used to add a bit of complexity, warmth, and/or fullness to your sound, good for "smoothing" out overdrive tones when you want them smooth. Otherwise, turning it down or off works well for more modern, punchier overdrive that's still technically soft clipping but doesn't sound too far off from outright distortion. Again, feel free to ignore this advice, but it's there if you want it.</p>

<p>That's it! Hope you enjoy messing around with this. Adding effects into this patch is both very possible and highly encouraged, I just wanted to post these building blocks in case anyone else had a need or want for a halfway-decent practice/headphone amp sim. Also I realize the gain and volume controls aren't coupled across the channels - that was 100% intentional and in no way due to me hastily duplicating the left channel objects to make this patch stereo. And yes, the name is silly.</p>

        <p>I like it very much, !!<br>Plugged my bass into it... yes a decent bass od patch is my holy grail..<br>Of all the playing around for an OD type effect, I would have to say my style, this is great choice on the Axo I have found so far. I see the are alot of adjustments to play around with so interested to get that tube style added in, almost feels like its already there. I tried adding another HP section of you patch into the mix setting the pitch and reso high, not bad, but need to think about that one a bit more...<br>I can see now going for a amp / cab sim approach will definately give a different approach to a straight effect style which I have toyed with for ages...<br>I will look into any OD style patch if it can avoid me having to use an external pedal instead...!<br><img src="https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/images/emoji/twitter/grin.png?v=5" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>

        <p>Thank you so much for this! This is an excellent counter to some of the tone loss that comes with running a guitar through Axo w/o having to deal with external buffers!</p>
