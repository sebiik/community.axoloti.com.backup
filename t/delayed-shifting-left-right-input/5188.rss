    <title>Delayed shifting left/right input</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/delayed-shifting-left-right-input/5188</link>
    <description>I was just thinking about how delaying one input and output by half the delay-time of the samplerate (so 1/(48000*2)sec) could add the possibility of using the stereo input as an oversampled input.
You could then send a single signal both to left and right and  read the left and right input serially to get the in-between values that an 48khz samplerate would miss.

Would this in any way be possible?</description>
