    <title>Analog outputs controlling filters, vco&#39;s and so</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/analog-outputs-controlling-filters-vcos-and-so/1408</link>
    <description>Hi Would it be possible to connect 2 analog filters to the 2 analog outputs on the axoloti?
I see in the PINOUT doc that PA5 and PA4 are analog outputs. Not sure but i guess this are 3.3 v outs.
What is the resolution of this DAC&#39;s? 

The midibox platform has a very nice module which provide 8 cv outs at 12 bits (DAC TLV5630). stable enough to drive vco&#39;s. it can also provide bipolar voltages.
I think the DAC is connected to the SPI interface and the midibox platform also uses the STM32F4 although they use freertos</description>

              <p>Hello,</p>

<p>I made a very simple CV output to control an analog filter. (old Frostwave MS20 clone).<br>I used an NPN transistor, and it's working really well!<br>I suppose it's not going to work for 1/V per octave, but for controlling something like a filter it works like a charm!</p>

<p>In the proces of making the simple circuit I think I fried PA4... PA5. is still working, but PA4 only outputs very small values in the mV range in stead of the full 0 to 3.3V.</p>

<p>I am very much a beginner when it comes to making these kind of circuits. Here is my simple circuit:</p>

<p>a)Analog GPIO PA4 (or 5) is connected to the BASE of the transistor.</p>

<p>b)The collector is connected to the TIP of my jack socket --- a 10k resistor --- the positive 9V lead of the Axo external power</p>

<p>c)The emitter is connected to the RING of the jack socket --- the GND of the GPIO --- the GND of the Axo power.</p>

<p>So it seems to works like that. But if I disconnect the GND of the GPIO it also still works.</p>

<p>So my question: what is the right and safest way to do this? Do I need to connect to the GND on the GPIO pins or not?</p>

<p>I also connected my new CV-out to the Axoloti input jack, since I don't need an input for this project. I soldered it to the pins just behind the jack input (with the markings T and R) on the Axoloti.<br>Is this safe or is there a possibilty of frying something?</p>

<p>Thanks very much for community insight!!! </p>

<p>If anyone is interested I'll post some pictures and sound.<br>Having an analog filter on my Axoloti-synth is a lot of fun and sounds GREAT!!! Also frees up some resources too!</p>
