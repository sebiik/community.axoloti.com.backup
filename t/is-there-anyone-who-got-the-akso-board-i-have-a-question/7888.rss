    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/is-there-anyone-who-got-the-akso-board-i-have-a-question/7888</link>
    <description>hey
i managed to get 2 of the AKSO boards when it was possible.. is there anyone else here who has it ? the akso forum is dead so im trying my luck here.. everything works fine with it except this: i have a sampler with the &#39;recording to a table&#39; part in the main patch and the playback is a polyphonic subpatch.. in the subpatch i refer to the tables like this &quot;../tablename&quot; which work perfectly in axoloti, but on akso it just gives error and dont find it.

im really happy if anyone can help !</description>

              <p>yes. if memory serves me correctly the akso firmware was based on something between the stable axoloti firmware and the 2.0 (dev) branch, which also has all sorts of issues. </p>

<p>the logical (albeit very unsatisfying) step would be to make the necessary changes to run the stable axoloti firmware on akso...  </p>

<p>it should be possible</p>
