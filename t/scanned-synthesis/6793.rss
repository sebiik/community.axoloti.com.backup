    <title>Scanned synthesis</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/scanned-synthesis/6793</link>
    <description>A versatile synthesis technique that hasn&#39;t been implemented very often. The Qu-Bit Scanned is the only commercial / hardware implementation around that I know. There are a few source codes online. But I&#39;m not skilled enough to translate them directly to Axoloti.

Here is the original article: www.billverplank.com/ScannedSynthesis.PDF
It works as a combination of a wavetable and physical modelling of a spring-mass-damper system. The system has a number of connected mass points that oscillate when excited. The structural oscillation ideally occurs at a &#39;haptic rate&#39;; a low frequency. The wavetable is then composed of a scan of the mass points at every moment (or at least at a certain update rate) and is played at note frequency. So you&#39;re essentially playing the wave shape of the mass-spring system which changes through time at the much lower, structural frequency. What you get is a dynamic and organic sounding oscillator.

So far I have a rudimentary implementation that works, but it&#39;s not very robust. Still very sensitive to the setting of the masses (m), springs between the masses (k), centering springs (c) and damping (d). With &#39;mesh&#39; set to 7, there are 128 mass points on a string with fixed boundaries.

To figure out and add:
- stability limits!
- adjustable update rate (in a way that will also save CPU)
- non-uniform mass and spring distribution (mentioned in the article that non-uniform settings really makes the sound more interesting, but also not implemented in the Qu-Bit module)
- different &#39;hammers&#39; for excitation: pluck, sine, saw, random squares, ... and interpolation between them
- audio injection (envelope) for excitation
- different excitation methods: applied force, velocity, position release
- different mass point connection matrices and scanning sequences
- wavetable interpolation</description>
