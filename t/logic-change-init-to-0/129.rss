    <title>Logic/change init to 0?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/logic-change-init-to-0/129</link>
    <description>This might be a matter of preference, I don&#39;t know, but...
logic/change seems to initialize to 0, regardless what is connected to it.
This means that it will trigger immediately when going live if a non-zero value is connected to it.
Maybe it would be better to initialize logic/change to whatever is connected to it before going live?
see example patch

              <p>Id agree this is not 'consistent' behaviour, </p>

<p>but ... funny Id say it should always trigger on first value...  otherwise I think we will get reports that things like sequencers are not playing the first step at startup.<br>(from a theoretical standpoint id say changes initial state is indeterminate, and therefore a first value is always a change)</p>

<p>this would also be an easy/optimal fix, as we change the init value to say MAX_INT, which would work for all values (except MAX_INT, which is pretty unlikely :)).</p>

<p>I think initialising from an upstream value could be tricky.</p>
