    <title>Fried board, need replacement!</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/fried-board-need-replacement/6407</link>
    <description>Hello there,
so finally I fried my axoloti.
My fault: I tried to add a segmented led display, because I need to know witch patch is running, but I have very bad soldering skills.
An expert friend of mine tested it and he declared it definitely dead...

This board is became one of the most important gears I use, so it is very important to me find a new one (or, even better, find a couple).

Fortunately I did this stupid thing because I haven&#39;t gigs and recording sessions with it for a couple of months, so I&#39;m in no hurry.

If anyone has got one spare axoloti to sell, please contact me:
lodevalm at gmail dot com

Many Thanks,
Daniele</description>
