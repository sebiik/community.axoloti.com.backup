    <title>Recording/Storing sequence in Axoloti</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/recording-storing-sequence-in-axoloti/6389</link>
    <description>Hello,

I have a patch, which consists mainly on a series of filters with individual volumen controls, that I would like to sequence.

I&#39;d like to work the sequence in an external dedicated interface, such as Live, Bitwig or similar, then &#39;store it&#39; in Axoloti standalone, and being able to &#39;play it&#39;.

First thing that comes to mind is of course a midi file, but I am unsure on how would I store it, and play it from within Axoloti in a manner that could be interpreted to drive the filters.

Any tips appreciated

Thank you</description>

<p>You can use a logic/change object for that. If you are using a dial to enter the value, then connect the dial to the blue inlet and then for the yellow inlet, connect the dial to a logic&amp;change object and then to the yellow inlet. Everytime you turn the dial, it sends a trigger to the yellow inlet.</p>

              <p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Internal port indeed sends back the midi to axoloti.</p>

<p>The midi player object requires a continuous "on" yellow signal.  A manually permanently pressed button object works, but there must be an object that does this  automatically, which is it? what object does provide that? It is difficult to find objects by functionality.</p>

<p>I still need to build the patch in a manner that it allows me to test if the pre-loaded midi file does load from sd card on standalone axoloti. </p>

<p>Thanks again</p>

<p>I'm not sure on the other thing, but I assume that if the midi file was on the sdcard the axoloti would load that when it's standalone... Try it and see!</p>

              <p>Thank you <a class="mention" href="/u/mattilynmattroe">@MattilynMattroe</a> for your reply.</p>

<p>The object is<code>jt/midi/play</code> and yes, it allows me to select the output device, including the following:</p>

<p><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/3/31f218be11ebb93e4f2ce07a8e2fbbda5889c01a.png" width="206" height="289"> </p>

<p>...there is no 'internal device' but it has 'internal port' 1 and 2 as you can see, will those cycle back ?</p>

<p>Additional question in case you may know, I can load a midi file from the computer, and I can save the patch, then open it again and the midi file is already loaded into the object. But I assume this will not remain as such once the patch is loaded into axoloti. Then, how to load the midi file by default into the object in axoloti standalone?</p>

<p>Thank you very much</p>

              <p>I'm not at home so can't check... If there are no outlets, does it let you select the output device? If so select internal device and the midi will be sent back round to the axo's input. So you can then use normal midi objects to use the midi inside the same patch</p>
