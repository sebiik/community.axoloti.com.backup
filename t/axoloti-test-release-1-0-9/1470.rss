    <title>Axoloti TEST release 1.0.9</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/axoloti-test-release-1-0-9/1470</link>
    <description>### Prerelease
**This release may contain showstopper bugs! Only use this if you have the patience to report bugs. To report bugs in this prerelease, reply in this thread! Patches saved in this version will not work with versions prior to this release**

Available at https://github.com/axoloti/axoloti/releases/tag/1.0.9

**This replaces 1.0.8 which is no longer supported** 
**replaced by 1.0.10** - Available at https://github.com/axoloti/axoloti/releases/tag/1.0.10 

**this version will no longer work with the community library**


as always we thank you for your help in testing.

[s]Note: I hope this is a release candidate i.e. if there are no major issues then it will become the release version. [/s]
This also means that only major bugs will be addressed in this release. (stability is the most important aspect here)

as issues were found, there will likely be a release for testing these issues are resolved.
It would be appreciated, if you could spend some time on 1.0.9 to ensure there are no other issues, before we release 1.010.  


## Installation ##
- backup your patches! (once saved in 1.0.9 you will not be able to open in 1.0.6!)
- (optionally... backup you axoloti home directory) 
- Install as normal from above
- The runtimes have not changed, no need to re-install that part
- when started use &#39;sync libraries&#39; to move factory to new 1.0.9 version 
(you can see this is done with Sync Successful : factory (1.0.9,anon) ) 
- your sub-patches may need to be upgrade (see below) 

## Changes compared to test release 1.0.8
* Improved - fallback for SD Card file loading
* Fix -  modulations in poly patches
* Fix - various object editor issues
* Improved -object editor add to library (replaces save as) 
* Fix/Improved - object editor workflow
* Fix -  windows when reinitialising libraries
* Improved/Fix - mid device detection on midi host port
* Improved  - objects now have a unique id (uuid) which is unrelated to name, and sha type is no longer used.
* Improved - disable update patch/patcher when patch is live
* Fix - various other issues/improvements, see logs for details 

## some thing to particularly test/re-try
- midi devices that were not being detected correctly
- using the object editor, please check the whole workflow
- embedded objects e.g. to create variations of factory objects


## Upgrading sub-patches
[important note regarding  community library](http://community.axoloti.com/t/axoloti-test-release-1-0-9/1470/3?u=thetechnobear)

again, I remind you , **backup you patches** before doing this!

There have been some small changes, which mean that patches with sub-patches **may** not compile,  if you open and save them , then re-open, they will fix themselves ;) 

If you have a lot of patches that need upgrading you can do this on the command line with
./Axoloti.sh -runUpgrade &lt;directory with patches&gt;

you may still need to do a couple manually, but it worked for all patches in the tutorial/demos except 2, so good chance it will work for most of your patches ;) 

## Troubleshooting
- please report bugs as per reporting guidelines, giving as many details as possible, including any messages present in the console. also please try to reproduce the issue.


- if you have troubles the &#39;fail safe&#39; is 
  - backup your patches/objects and your axoloti home directory including preferences you can re-test later if needed.
  - if issues with libraries, try preferences-&gt;init libraries
  - delete your axoloti.prefs file
  - if that doesn&#39;t work, try deleting your axoloti home directory (this will re-download the libraries)


## Known issues (unresolved)

## Known issues (fixed in development)
- &#39;zombie&#39; objects cannot be replaced. (workaround: needs to be deleted, then new object added)
- converting a subpatch into an embedded object will render patch corrupt 
(workaround: don&#39;t do it ;))
- embedded subpatch , save option should not be available (only apply/add to lib)
- error when saving objects with no description
- apply a change to an object whilst live renders patch corrupt/display issue, should not be a allowed to edit, whilst live (workaround: don&#39;t do it)  - fix, user is no longer able to take a patch live, whilst the object editor is open with a patcher/object

##Limitations
- limitations on parameter types for object editor, and cannot set optional attributes (eg. max/min)
(currently consider this as unsupported for this release)

<p>yeah, same fate here... each person has their own workflow, so when I test things, of course, the way I use it works, but give it to someone else - and it obviously doesn't. at work, Id have a QA team and other developers (and more time) so these things get ironed out quickly, but not the case here...<br>I think, I underestimated the effort on getting the editing to work with the object editor... and all the knock-on effects its had, but its getting there.... which honestly is a bit of a relief <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<blockquote><p>its no big deal, just fixed it. ... will be available when the PR is accepted.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>Got around to testing it now, again just a brief test but the save stuff seems to work as I would expect now.</p>

<p>Another thing that seems to be fixed is that prior to this PR, often whenever I alt-tabbed or otherwise changed focus from the patch/object editor to another window, the editor would scroll to the end of my code (I have more k-rate code than fits on the screen for the particular object I'm working on). Now the editor doesn't do that and just remains in the same location, also it seems to remember where I was editing, even after closing it and reopening it, which good - before, I was forever scrolling back to get to the position in the code where I was editing.</p>

<p>The 'Generate and Compile code' option in the Patch menu looks good to me, actually, at first it looks like a heading and there's a slight surprise when it is actually clickable but of course I know it is since it's been up for discussion. Anyway I think it's clearer now, would be good if someone who's never seen it before could provide a reaction to it too as my mind has now been poisoned by the fact that I know how it works... <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>unfortunately the editors report strings as empty (e.g. "") but then we have to changes this to null, to ensure we dont have empty cdata sections, but instead an empty xml tag.<br>but now that I've moved to using the xml to see if the objects has changed, I was missing this in one location... so was comparing an empty tag vs a empty cdata section, so though it was different.<br>anyway works now<br>note: the two things behave identical, so the version you have is working fine, except for this warning.</p>

              <p>Ok, just a quick test so far, I can verify that 'edit object definition' and the edit button in a patch/object object seems to do the same thing now.</p>

<p>However, there seems to be something odd with the logic, but it can also be that I don't understand exactly how it's supposed to work.</p>

<p>If I make a change to the k-rate code, for instance, and click the close button on the window, I get the dialog 'Unsaved changes, do you want to apply? (Yes/No/Cancel)'. However, if I click Yes, the next time I click edit, then close,I get the same question, indicating that the changes weren't in fact applied last time. Looking at my edited code, it looks like they were in fact applied, and the generated xpatch.cpp confirms this too. I would have expected that once I've applied the changes once, I wouldn't get the question again, because that implies that the changes weren't in fact applied the first time.</p>

<p>What does the 'Apply' option in the File menu actually do? - in a similar vain, even if I've selected this, I get the same 'Unsaved changes...' dialog when I close the editor (which seems consistent with the rest of the behavior though).</p>

<p>It's not that the 'Unsaved...' dialog comes up every time I open the object editor, if I open it and don't make any changes at all it doesn't come up. So it seems that the object editor considers the object to have changed if there were any changes made since the editor was opened the first time, not since the last time the changes were applied.</p>

<p>Ok, got to go... sorry for being brief.</p>

              <p>(fyi, for others not following thread .. these are in development, not in 1.0.9. then will be in the next release) </p>

<p>I did some work on this today and yesterday which has now been merged into development.</p>

<p>I tried quite a few things, and now seem to be better<br>there are 2 known issues...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the  tabs when shown on the patch/object are sometimes shown as disabled(?), they aren't and still work, so its a UI thing. (tried a few things to solve, its a bit weird, its not focus... and same code path for when its right and wrong)</p></li>
<li><p>when you edit an object, and save/apply , the object in the patch is not immediately updating... you need to use the object browser to replace it. (it should be shown correctly there)  ... this is a bit odd, the patch has been told its changed, so not sure if its ignoring it, or just not repainting.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>obviously the latter, is more important...</p>

<p>apart from that, saves/apply seemed to be applied correctly, as does saying no to changes. and the whole confirmation code is improved - there were quite a few changes to get to this state though, so its possible I've missed something <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/frowning.png?v=0" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>there are two issues (both fixed in development) </p>

<p>it saves embedded object with the wrong type, and also with a blank description</p>

<p>if you look in the AXP file, you can fix this</p>

<p>the embedded object save with the wrong type , you will see in your patch file:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;object class="axoloti.object.AxoObjectFromPatch" id="patch/object" uuid="9e1ee6d1-3e17-41e1-b36e-66f03511a81a"&gt;</code></pre>

<p>simply change this to:</p>

<p>   </p>

<p>i.e. you are removing the bit which says "class="axoloti.object.AxoObjectFromPatch"", </p>

<p>you should keep the uuid that it says already</p>

<p>also you will see underneath </p>

<pre><code>     &lt;sDescription&gt;&lt;/sDescription&gt;</code></pre>

<p>change this to</p>

<pre><code>     &lt;sDescription&gt;blah&lt;/sDescription&gt;</code></pre>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/blindsmyth">@Blindsmyth</a>, Im sending you the fixed file now.</p>

<p>EDIT:<br>this will happen each time you create a new patch/object.  (or convert and embed existing object) </p>

<p>you can stop the description error, by ensuring you enter a description for the patch/object you create,<br>but the other error cannot be avoided... you will have to edit the AXP file to fix it.</p>

<p>until of course the next release where this is fixed.</p>

              <p>yeah, the close object editor thing may be reviewed/improved in another release.<br>my main priority is to ensure we don't end up with corrupt patches/unsaved changes etc, as thats understandably very annoying for everyone.</p>

<p>yes, Ive made edit and edit object definition, do the same thing... which is to edit your instance of the object, which, I agree, I think is what most want/expect.</p>

<p>Ive think I've found and resolved most of the issues you mention, lots of different things - missing fields checks, and needing you to move focus off a field were main culprits. but to fix, Ive gone for a new approach, which checks the if the generated xml would change. <br>Ive also made alot of changes around ensuring, changes are only applied if you ask for them to be... there were a few inconsistencies. unfortunately this has highlighted another issue with the editor used for inlets/outlets etc... so we need to resolve this before, I can push this to the dev repo.</p>

<p>anyway, its looking better much better, thanks for the report.<br>I'll let you know when the new version is checked-in, and perhaps you can have another play with it if/when you get time.</p>

<blockquote><p>Unfortunate , the editors have no link to the patchers, nor any concept of them going live - I could inform via the link but, I'd then have to implement a read only mode, and also I'm not 100% sure that the corruption wouldn't happen if the editor was returned after the patch came back from live. <br>Really this was a band aid fix , since we need to get out of this test cycle.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>One advantage to the 'need to close' thing is that previously I sometimes ended up with a couple of editors for the same object (not because of a bug but because I'd forgotten I already had one open!) which got really confusing after a while.</p>

<p><aside class="quote"><blockquote>
<p>I'll take a look at the edit va edit definition, for perhaps just use the edit button on the patch/object</p>
<p>I'm tempted to remove either the edit button or edit definition option for this object as it's clearly a duplication.</p>
</blockquote></aside></p>

<p>To my mind it would seem that both the 'edit object definition' and the edit button should have the same functionality at least. And the edit button is a handy shortcut and a visual hint that the object is in fact embedded and not part of a library. So my vote would be to keep both, but have them do the same thing.</p>
