    <title>Increasing the 3khz control rate frequency</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/increasing-the-3khz-control-rate-frequency/6427</link>
    <description>Hey people,
I want to use the axoloti to control the following 40Channel DAC board.
https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/eval-ad5370.html#eb-overview
https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/evaluation-documentation/EVAL-AD5370_5372_5373EB.pdf
https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/AD5370.pdf

As i plan to use the axoloti mainly for controlling those channels I am wondering if there is a way to increase the control rate frequency from 3khz to for example 48 khz or 24khz.
I read the following topic and wanted to implement the spi communication similarily but I think that the script objects loop function is called at a rate of 3khz only, isnt it?
Or is there a better way to implement that spi code as a pseudo audio object or with a totally different approach which gives even better performance?

Thanks in advance,
Florian</description>

    Hi all: I did a module with Axoloti for my 5U modular. The module have: 

4 CV inputs (CV control + CV Atenautor) connected to PA0 to PA3. 1 Digital Input (with voltaje protection) connected to PB0. 2 CV outputs (0 to 10V) connected to PA4 and PA5 DAC outputs. 2 CV outputs (0 to 10V) connected to PA6 and PA7 using PWM at 10KHz. 6 Digital outputs connected to PC0 to PC5. 1 LED connected to PB1.

<p>It is just working fine except two problems. <br>The first problem is actually the reason why i started this thread. The control rate of 3khz is not ideal for smooth sweeps. A sine Lfo cannot be used in higher Frequencies as it is a strange staircase then.<br>The second problem is that the patcher or actually my hole OS freezes when constantly turn the dial around for 20 seconds in the patch "basic_setting.axp". My mouse is not visible anymore and nothing interacts. So I have to reboot.<br>Has anyone an idea what the reason for this is? I am using windows 10 at the moment and the axoloti patchers version is:<br>Build Version: 1.0.12-2-0-g60a2f99<br>Build Date: 08/04/2018 20:20:07 CEST<br>Java version: 1.8.0_161</p>

<p>I could not find a log file which is telling me what happened thats why I am kind of clueless...<br>- Flub</p>

<p>--- EDIT<br>The problem only occurs when i have multiple DAC output objects at the same time.</p>

<pre><code>attr_table.array[attr_channel] = inlet_i1 &gt;&gt; 11;</code></pre>

<p>I think somehow it is problematic to write to multiple keys of the array from many "patcher/object" objects at the same time... Is that possible?</p>

<p>in my DAC controller object i call this at k-rate:</p>

<pre><code>for (uint8_t i = 0; i &lt; 40; i++) {
	if (attr_table.array[i] != DACLevels[i]) {
		setDAC(i, X, attr_table.array[i]);
		DACLevels[i] = attr_table.array[i];
	}
}
pulseLDAC();`</code></pre>

<p>__EDIT: <br>I just realized it is not freezing anymore when i set FPCLK/8 instead of FPCLK/4. Can it be that there is somekind of problem with the SPI library?</p>

<p>As you've noted there shouldn't be a difference in performance, it all ends up in one big function when the patch is compiled anyway.</p>

<p>I find patcher objects handy when developing objects as it means both the object and the surrounding patch are saved together and it's not necessary to keep the files for the patch and separate object that you are working on in sync.</p>

              <p>The limit you're hitting isn't caused by the 3khz K-rate. You're being limited by the actual speed of the SPI link. Observe the DSP load %, running with FPCLK/4, FPCLK/8, FPCLK/16.

<p>If you want to make an object instead of a subpatch I think there is something to gain. All the inlets uses ram. So ilets sat you have 10 objects inside a subpatch and they are all connected via in/outlets and you code the 10 objects in one single object, you don't have all those inlets/outlets anymore and you can save the memory used in the subpatch.</p>

<p>Another question:<br>I now implement the code in a patch/object. Is it somehow more perfomant to export it as a real object somehow? I dont know how to do it, but I am curious if it is worth trying out.</p>

<p>And then use a variable to select which slot of the array you want to select:</p>

<p>outlet_l = a[param_sel];</p>

<p>Another way is to take advantage of srate inlets. If you are using many inlets, this is going to be the easiest way I think. If you are routing tons of cables, using this method can make bi patches a little bit easier to comprehed and work with.</p>

<p>If you make srate inlets, the red ones, but put the code into krate fan, you can actually route 16 krate signals through a srate inlet. Krate is 3000 srate is 48000, so 48000/3000=16.....</p>

<p>Something like this image below. Here I have ONE single srate inlet and then I use inlet[0], inlet[1], inlet[2], etc. to display each value from each of the parts of the inlets.</p>

<p>You can simply use:</p>

<p>inlet_i[set number here]</p>

<p>I ve got a quick question about dynamically reading the inlet values.</p>

<pre><code>disp_d1 = inlet_i1 &gt;&gt; 11;

I just recognized that it is a bigger problem that my midi controller "akai midimix" cannot send NRPN cc messages. I mean that i can only get 0-127 steps from the faders which is not perfect.

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/ricard">@ricard</a> Thank you for that hint. I am not sure if I understood it correctly. What you described would happen if i put the spiSend function inside the S-Rate code tab? </p>
<p>Is there a way to execute my code 48000 times per second?</p>
</blockquote></aside>

<p>If you put code inside the K-rate tab, it will be executed 3000 times per second, at roughly equal intervals (1/3000 s = 0.333 ms). The exact time at with the code is executed (relative to the 3000 Hz K-rate 'tick') depends on where the patcher actually places your code relative to the code for all the other modules. The higher up and further to the left in the patcher GUI you place a module, the closer to the 3000 Hz K-rate 'tick' it will be executed. Most often, modules take about the same amount of time to execute each time, so your code will get called fairly regularly at 0.333 ms intervals wherever in the physical patcher GUI space it is locaed.</p>

<p>If you put code inside the S-rate tab, the patcher puts a 16 times loop around it, and executes the loop at the K-rate of 3000 Hz. Thus, your code will be executed 48000 times a second (16 x 3000 Hz), but the interval between each time your code is called will not be 1/48000 = 20.833 µs. Rather, every 0.333 ms, your code will be called 16 times in quick succession. This means that if you're driving, say, an external DAC directly, and want to supply data (samples) every 20.833 µs (corresponding to 48000 Hz), it won't work, as you'll get a significantly shorter sample interval during the 16 times loop, and then a significantly longer (essentially, 0.333 ms minus the time it took the loop to run) time before the next burst of 16 samples.</p>

<p>But let's assume that the DAC has an internal FIFO that is at least 16 samples deep, and that the DAC consumes one sample from the FIFO per sampling interval (i.e. 20.833 µs @ 48000 kHz). In that case you could fire off 16 samples from the (implied loop in the) S-rate code, and the DAC would take care of them at the proper sampling interval, operating on one sample per sampling interval from the FIFO.</p>

<p>The point here is that if you want to precisely fire off a hardware event at a determined and constant interval, it won't work with S-rate code. Even K-rate code is dodgy, as the exact interval depends on the execution time of all the modules preceding your module. In some cases, like driving an external shift register to increase the number of GPIOs, when the exact interval is not important, it can be perfectly fine. But if you want drive a DAC to generate a stream of samples you want a very precise interval between the sample output.</p>

<p>(This raises the question of how the Axoloti handles the ADC and DAC in the ADAU1961 codec on the Axoloti board. The answer is that the codec is set up to generate and receive one sample per 48000 kHz sampling interval. The samples are sent using an I2S serial communications line which communicates with an I2S transceiver in the Axoloti. The I2S transceiver is in turn configured to continually send and receive a circular buffer of 32 samples for the DAC and 32 samples for the ADC, and generate an interrupt to the Axoloti firmware every 16 samples. This is what generates the K-rate sampling interval. At every K-rate interrupt, the Axoloti framework switches which half of the 32 sample in- and output buffers which is connected to the input and output modules, respectively. </p>

<p>Essentially, 16 samples from the ADC are accumulated in the input buffer, at the S-rate, which at the next K-rate interrupt are made available for the input module, and processed using the active patch, which in turn writes samples to the output buffer. At the same time, 16 samples from the previous run of the patch are being sent to the DAC. So the patch is constantly working on the 16 samples from the ADC from the previous K-rate interval, and writing 16 samples which will be sent to the DAC at the next K-rate interval.</p>

<p>Technically, the K-rate could be the same as the S-rate. However, this would mean that all processing for a single sample would need to take place at a 20.833 µs interval rather than a 0.333 ms interval. There are two reasons why this is not practical. First of all, there is an overhead setting up inputs and outputs etc for all modules, which then occurs for each sample, and not every 16 samples. Secondly, in order to optimze the DSP code, certain parameters are assumed to be constant during a K-rate interval. The resonance parameter for a filter is a good example of this. Limiting the resonance to be constant during a K-rate interval makes it possible to optimize the DSP code for the filter, leading to shorter overall execution times. Also, many processors, although I'm not sure about the ARM Cortex-M4F in the Axoloti, have instructions which can execute several trivial operations in one cycle (SIMD instructions) which can be used to optimize DSP code. Many CPUs have caches which speed up code execution, but they become really useful first when there are (tight) loops in the code. As far as I know though, the Cortex-M4F used in the Axoloti has no cache so this is not relevant.</p>

<p>So all in all, running DSP code in a K-rate vs S-rate environment allows significant optimizations of the code, which one wouldn't get with code processing individual samples all the way at the S-rate.</p>

<p>In fact, the K-rate used in the Axoloti is rather fast. In many DSP systems it can be a factor of 64 slower than the S-rate, or even slower, to minimize overhead, at the cost of increased latency. Indeed, the Axoloti system, with its 3 kHz K-rate, as an end-to-end (analog in to analog out) latency of about 0.333 ms * 2 = 0.667 ms, i.e. significantly less than a millisecond. That's about the same time it takes to transmit two MIDI bytes, of for a sound wave in air to travel about 20 cm.</p>

<p>Sorry for the long winded explanation... )</p>

<p>Axoloti editor has 2 fans for  putting code for objects into, one for K-rate, which is 3khz and one for S-rate, which is 48khz.</p>
<p>You can probably just put the code in the 48khz fan and it will be updated at 48khz?</p>
</blockquote></aside>

<p>No, what happens is that the Axoloti framwork puts a 16 times loop around the S-rate code, and runs the whole loop at the K-rate. So the code in the loop will be executed 48000 times per second, but not in a uniform manner, rather, 3000 times per second it will execute 16 times in a row. For some applications this is fine, but it doesn't sound like it would be a good idea if outputting data to one ore more DACs which need a regular sample interval corresponding to 48000 Hz.</p>

              <p>thats exciting please keep us updated. maybe oyu wanna do another thread just for the DAC board driver though so its easier to find, since this current thread title is kind of misleading.</p>

<p>i thought you might be using the electro smith modules that also mostly utilize CEM chips:<br><a href="https://www.electro-smith.com/electro-boards" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.electro-smith.com/electro-boards</a><br>they have a VCO, VCF, VCA and the FV-1 multieffect, all in very basic but super convenient "developement boards". i got a couple of them around and was gonna do something similar to what you're doing i think, use the axoloti as a controller, for UI, LFOs, envelopes etc and just send CVs to the analog submodules. But it looks like the stuff you're using is very similar.</p>
