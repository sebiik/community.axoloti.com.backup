    <title>How to patch switchable Unison mode?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/how-to-patch-switchable-unison-mode/3571</link>
    <description>On the microKorg for example you can change the voicing to be mono (only one voice plays), poly (normal polyphonic voice allocation), or unison (all voices play at once). I see the Deepmind has modes like unison 2 (2 voices play) etc. Can this be patched into a poly subpatch on the Axoloti? I keep thinking the polyindex object has to be involved in this but can&#39;t figure out how to do it :frowning:

edit:

I thought about it a little more. Sadly I am away from home for a few days without my Axo but I wanted to ponder on this to make good use of my time.. I came up with an idea but am not sure if it is completely the wrong way to go.

So here&#39;s the super simple &quot;voice&quot;. It has 4 inlets for both pitch and gate and the polyindex object determines which of these the voice will listen to.

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a8eeb3f44518d14c9f764d5187abcc602055680f.png&quot; width=&quot;458&quot; height=&quot;421&quot;&gt;

The MIDI in object is in the parent. There is a counter that advances on each trig and controls the demuxers for pitch and gate that determine to which voice on the subpatch these are sent. Then there is a toggle that when on should make the pitch and gate go to every voice.

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4054e80332a900660db5fb113bb3d7e767973a53.png&quot; width=&quot;587&quot; height=&quot;472&quot;&gt;

Would this work or am I on the wrong track?</description>

              <p>I took another approach in my junoesque patch (library/community/cpwitz/synths/webmidi/junebug). </p>

<p>The poly-voice subpatch has a unisono toggle switch and two inlets uni-pitch/uni-gate. These inlets are connected to a midi/in/keyb object in the main patch, which is acting monophonically. The unisono-toggle switch triggers two multiplexers (mux) in the poly-subpatch which decide, if the pitch/gate-inlets are used for pitch and gate or the subpatch's internal polyphonic midi/in/keyb. And to provide some unisono detuning per voice, the subpatches polyindex is used for detuning if the toggle is set to unisono. Hard to explain with words. Simply take a look at the patch in the community library.</p>

              <p>yeah, its a fun challenge... its not 'hard' but its got a few edge cases to entertain you.</p>

<p>if your familiar with C and creating objects, its a bit easier to do with a custom object... just because you can do it all in one object with the logic in one place , rather than having it split over several logic objects... but definitely do-able via patching only.</p>

              <p>True about the counter, I did not think of that. I also didn't know that you can send internal MIDI between "levels" ie. from parent to subpatch. That sounds like the way to go. Say I have 4 voices available and want to be able to switch between momo/poly/uni modes... I have to think a bit more about this <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>edit: actually your patch will need some additional logic, as the counter is too simplistic, a voice starts and stops based on gate, e.g. if you keep holding note 1 down, and play others notes, it will have to cycle 2,3,4,2,3,4... It cannot use 1 again, since its still in use... so you need to track note status... and this can be tricky at times.</p>

<p>also its probably worth noting, things like legato are I think also partially coded in the voice allocation logic, so if you need that, then you'll need more tweaks</p>

              <p>yeah, unfortunately I think there only a couple of alternatives, to basically 'skip' the internal voice allocation of the subpatch poly mode.</p>

<p>your approach is cool, and will work fine - but can be a lot of cables quite quickly, once the voice count increases, or you want more midi (e.g. velocity, poly pressure)</p>

<p>off-hand, I can think of two alternatives... <br>- use 'expressive poly' mode with a subpatch filter on internal midi bus, then in main patch send midi via the internal midi bus to multiple channels. will add  (a max) of 1 cycle latency<br>- store data in a table in the main patch, then get the voices to read the table, using polyindex as a index - Ive used this approach for sequencing multiple voices, you can store lots of data per voice. </p>

<p>with these approaches, you can minimise the changes required to the voice patch, which is something I like to do.... <br>but your approach is probably easier to see whats going on .</p>
