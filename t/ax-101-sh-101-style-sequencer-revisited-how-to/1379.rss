    <title>AX-101 (sh-101 style sequencer) Revisited (how to?)</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/ax-101-sh-101-style-sequencer-revisited-how-to/1379</link>
    <description>I have been working with the ax-101 (sh-101) style sequencer that was made a while back.

I am trying to revise it to have more. What I would like Is to have more table read and table write so that I can have more tracks instead of buying many axolotis for each table write and read... (my step input from midi keyboard on usb port)

I have made silly revisions that I still am working with.. basically I copy and pasted the patch, changed table read and write names and size from 64 to 32 .

added modulation cc for table 2.

so vol cc writes table read and write t1, while other writes then reads for diff cc position..

Is this right?

Its a really good patch this 5b revision and i would like more tracks to record on and trigger from seperate channels to step the sequence forward....

Thanks for the hard work in sound everyone!</description>
