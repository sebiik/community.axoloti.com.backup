    <title>How can I save and recall numbers higher than 63 to/from a table?</title>

    <description>Hello :) 

I was trying to create a table filled with numbers of higher values and I am having some issues saving/recalling the values. Well I am not sure if it is when I record the numbers to the table or if it is when I play them back it goes wrong. Here is a little explanation:


First of all, to play the values back, I had to edit the table/read object with blue(frac) outlet. I changed the outlet to green(integer), to be able to playback higher values than 64. But after changing the outlet to green, I noticed that the values was way our of range, outputting values in millions. So I divide the output with 2097152, and then it gives the correct values, tis has worked in many other cases dividing by 2097152.

BUT then the problems happens. As soon as I an trying to read a value higher than 64, the outputtet value jumps to -64 and stays there, like it is out of range. I dont understand that nor how to fix that.

I know I had to divider by 2097152 to get the right number, that might play a role on why I reach the actual integer limit so fast. Cause when I am sending out a value of 64 i am actually sending out a value of 64 x 2097152, which is 134.217.728, which is a lot higher. That seem to be the integer range limit of Axoloti. 

Are there other ways to get the tables to play high integer values back in correct way, without having to divide with 2097152? We could definately use a table that plays back integers correctly or maybe I just havent found it yet.

BTW I am using 32bit table. I have tried all table types with no luck. Not sure where to go from here.

Any suggestions are welcome :)</description>
