    <title>Load patch on start up problem</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/load-patch-on-start-up-problem/1958</link>
    <description>Hi,
I can&#39;t make my patch loading on startup. If in standalone I eject the sdcard and then insert it, the patch loads and works fine. But I want it to be loaded on startup when turning the axoloti on, and not have to eject and insert the card each time. I formated the sdcard with axoloti as suggested on another post regarding this topic, but has not effect. Thanks for your help!</description>

              <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/users/djeremaille">@Djeremaille</a> It works now using your strategy,  that is to say "upload to flash" (I forgot to say in my former post I was using "upload to SDCard as startup" option). I think then you need to tell axoloti what patch you need to load on startup in Window-&gt;Remote-&gt;Running. But this option seems to bug (at least on my OS) and I can't select the patch I want to load on startup. By default It does not load at startup the last patch you uploaded but the first on the list on the SDcard (that's what I understood trying to find a solution). So the solution for me was to delete all the patches I uploaded on the SDcard save the one I want to work with. Now it works fine.<br>Can somebody explain how to choose the patch to load on startup, I guess it is with the "running" option, would be nice to choose startup patch without having to delete/format SDcard each time.<br>The option "upload to SDCard as startup"is bug?</p>

  <blockquote>Hey! I'm having troubles with executing my patch from SD, the Upload to SD as startup option produces a console message returning a success, but the patch doesn't load. This behavior persists after power-cycling the unit with an Android charger instead of the regular USB. 

Upload to flash seems to do the trick every time, but it seems I have to do a firmware reset before uploading a new patch. If I leave it plugged into the computer via USB, the patch seems to load but my MIDI controller isn't â€¦
