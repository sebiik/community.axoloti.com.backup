    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/build-your-own-custom-boutique-guitar-pedal-construction-set-byocbgpcs/5697</link>
    <description>I was just building myself a custom boutique guitar pedal with an Axoloti when I thought, &quot;Hey aren&#39;t there a lot of people who want to use this?&quot;  Axoloti is soooo good at helping designers who have great ideas, but no time/space/tools/etc to make boutique pedals.  Since I have a little extra time on my hands right now, I&#39;d like to discuss the design of a common HW platform that could would have the features the majority of people would want to use!

I&#39;m imagining us using it for our own music, for that curious friend who always asks, &quot;Hey can you make me a pedal that does something crazy like generator notes in a key signature in time to the tap tempo&quot; and even make your own small run of boutique pedals!

I&#39;m willing to take on this project!  B)  So I&#39;d like to hear from others what controls/features they want in it.  For example, how many knobs, what size knobs?  How many switches?  how many tap switches?  Should there be a display?  A selector switch?  What other features would you want?</description>

I've made my first PCB for it and my first cuts into the case with a CNC!

              <p>I've created a brief video to outline my ideas more articulately!  </p>

<p>I show off some crazy rare boutique guitar pedals I've collected, talk about why <strong>Axoloti kicks so much ass</strong> for this  project and ask for community input.  What I'd really like to see is people making <strong>small runs of insanely specialized pedals</strong> and custom orders for big name musicians.  In other words, I'm trying to leverage the technology to expand a <strong>creative economy</strong>.</p>

              <p>Just my view only, i think using the axoloti as a boutique guitar pedal could be a significant over kill.<br>To make a pedal that can do something crazy, when it is capable of doing lots and lots of crazy things.. !<br>How many knobs = as many as you can fit in whatever box you use.<br>What size knobs = the best size that prevents you from loosing space to fit as many knobs as you can.</p>

<p>Maybe how I would approach it, is a guitar friendly midi controller that can be connected to the axoloti, may it linkls to a pedal switch, maybe it links to 50 pedal switches, maybe it links to an expression pedal, maybe it links to 50 expression pedals.<br><img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/grin.png?v=5" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>
