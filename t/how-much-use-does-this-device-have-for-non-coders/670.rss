    <title>How Much Use Does This Device Have For Non Coders?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/how-much-use-does-this-device-have-for-non-coders/670</link>
    <description>Hi, I haven&#39;t bought one yet, but I was curious if I could have some input from current users what the state of the project is.
I have very little coding experience. 
I have been making music with similar(ish) devices for many years.
Just curious how useful this device is for people who won&#39;t likely be contributing anything on the development side. I can build damn near anything with a real/virtual modular system that I put my brain to...but I don&#39;t have the time to spend learning coding to scratch build modules myself.
So how useful is this thing for a noncoder? I will likely buy one just to support it, but hope that it will be more than just a toy I use for a couple months and resell. It looks like a heavily customizable Nord Modular (and more) to my musician/sound designer brain, but I would like to hear users&#39; experiences. I get the impression that most of the people who already own one of these have higher than average coding skills, so it&#39;s hard to gauge the utility for a casual user.
Thanks.</description>

              <p>no coding experience here at all. in fact, very little experience with "virtual modular" patching either. I got one from the indiegogo campaign and immediately regretted not getting two. I just ordered another unit and can't wait! I'm trying to build an all hardware studio and slowly phase out the need for my laptop as a necessity (other than recording) so the axoloti has been a great little "chameleon" machine to fill in the gaps where ever I've needed it in my productions. mostly mono/poly synths and some synth drums so far. I'm still working on building interesting effects and other strange experimental sound generators.</p>

              <p>I also am a non coder, and i can say it is immensely fun. I have no experience with the nord modular, but i never run out of ideas for new patches and things to do with the axoloti. I'd highly recommend getting one. Its brought me hours apon hours of entertainment.</p>
