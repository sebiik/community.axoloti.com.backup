    <title>Monitoring midi output</title>

    <description>Hi all,

I was wondering, does anyone know a way of monitoring the midi output of a particular output...

There&#39;s been times where I&#39;ve wished for an object just like the midi monitor object except that it logs whatever is being sent out of an output. Useful for knowing exactly what you are sending back to, say, a midi controller.

At the moment I often monitor what&#39;s coming out of one axo by hooking it up to another axo which has the monitor object on it.

Maybe I should already know what midi I&#39;m sending out when it&#39;s my own code but, gosh darn it, it gets confusing!</description>
