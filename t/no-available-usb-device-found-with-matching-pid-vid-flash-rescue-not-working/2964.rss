    <title>No available USB device found with matching PID/VID - Flash rescue not working!</title>

    <description>Hello!

I was just trying to connect all three of my Axolotis to my laptop. And I by mistake forgot to change the power of the power supply that is used for the USB-hub to 4.5v. It was on 9v. One of the boards was connected at the time I turned the power supply on..... and now it is not working :angry: Maybe it got too much voltage?

Stupid me, now I am getting the &quot;No available USB device found with matching PID/VID&quot;. It does behave the same was as both of my other boards and the LED is steady green, so it seems like it is powered as it should. But it just doesnt connect and it is not available in the &quot;select device&quot; list. Right now I have the board connected directly to the Macbook, to eliminate the usb hub as an issue.

I tried doing the flash rescue, but it seems like it doesnt recognise the board at all. I get this message when trying to do the falsh rescue:

&quot;No devices in DFU mode detected. To bring Axoloti Core in DFU mode, remove power from Axoloti Core, and then connect the micro-USB port to your computer while holding button S1. The LEDs will stay off when in DFU mode.&quot;

Have I fried the board totally or what have I done? 

Any help appreciated!

<p>Thank you for your inputs, I really appreciate it. But I think this is was over my head. I think I just need to get another board or 2. Well it is soon my birthday, in a couple of months. A good reason to get a couple more and a reliable USB hub, I guess <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<blockquote><p>'user firmware' upgrade procedure<br>...<br>bootstrap loader could be put on an sdcard</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>It is technically possible to make a sdcard-based flasher, the current flasher pretends to be a "patch binary" and could run as a startup patch on sdcard, except that it expects a firmware image loaded in sdram, but that could be replaced with loading a firmware image from sdcard. But in case flashing fails or is interrupted, it's left with an incomplete firmware and probably can't launch another attempt. While the "flash rescue"/dfu process is totally independent of firmware or flash memory contents, but that depends on USB. <br>Firmware upload via SWD is certainly possible when just usb is failing, but requires an stlink/v2 programmer.</p>

<p>as you say if it run patches, with power but just not USB comms still useable... still great for an FX board, or midi utility.<br>build a couple of hardware buttons to switch patches, and perfect to leave in the studio as a utility -  just prepare the SD card on another axoloti. (as Ive got a few axo boards, I do tend to leave a couple of them for 'fixed' use anyway <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> ) </p>

<p>one thing to consider.. before you upgrade next time, you will only be able to run patches off the SD card that are built using the same firmware version. <br>(so keep a backup of the '1.0.12' axo, it'll be no hassle switching your 'building board' between 1.0.12 and the newer version regularly, I do this all the time)</p>

<p>this leads to two questions for <a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a>, about upgrading firmware without the patcher/usb<br>(which might give you a way to  upgrade it later)</p>

<p>a) the 'user firmware' upgrade procedure, basically puts a patch on the board, which then makes it load a new firmware... (a bootstrap process) - I wonder if it would be possible to adapt this, such that this bootstrap loader could be put on an sdcard, and then moved that card to the 'sick' axo, such that it can upgrade from the card.</p>

<p>b) is it possible to upgrade the firmware via the SWD port?<br>jaffa you'd need an extra dongle, so it may not be worth it, and its going to be a pain/possibly complex</p>

<p>(obviously, not much point in spending huge amounts of time on this, for one board - but I think its interesting hypothetically)</p>

<p>Yes this was really stupid mistake. I had used the power supply for my Kaos pad 3, which used different voltage... Argh.. Yes I feel lucky that I hadnt connected both of my boards to ti right now.. I need to get a new USB hub.. This one is no good anyway.</p>

<p>That is all right. I still have got 2 boards to work with. I think I will take it too my friends house and let him take a look at it. He just fixed my Virus C, which had been doomed to be dead by several repair guys 10 years ago..... So I am hoping he can help me troubleshoot and find out what is dead and what not...</p>

<p>Or else I just need to get another board, i guess.</p>

<p>Yeah that might be a solution. I need to check this out. I could just use it as an effect unit powered from external power supply. It behaves exactly like all my other boards when connecting it, with blinking and goes steady green. I'll do some testing and see what comes out of it <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>The Axoloti Core, if the blinks at startup and then move to steady green, possibly only the usb connection circuitry is toasted, my wild guess is that U5 (and likely U7 too) is fried, part number is "USBLC6-2SC6" (ironically a protection chip) that could be replaced with good soldering skills, but no certainty that replacing this will fix it. Sorry I can't offer a repair service for this. </p>

<p>Maybe it still has a use without USB connection, insert an sdcard with your favorite patch(es) from another Axoloti Core and consider this one now as a single-function Axoloti?</p>
