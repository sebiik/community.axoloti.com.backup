    <title>Thank you Axoloti community</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/thank-you-axoloti-community/3878</link>
    <description>A quick ...long shout out to say thank you to all the great people (and apparently one robot) that make this such a great site. I&#39;ve only been an owner of an Axoloti core for a number of months and I am learning so much, so quickly... thanks to all the contributors that have such a deep knowledge and/or understanding of what they are doing/coding.  I&#39;m a hack of all trades, a master of none... so really appreciate real world experiences of others with which I can learn from.  Basically, I am old, hard of hearing from loud parties, industry without earplugs, guitars, cymbals, and vocal feedback that has had me weak at the knees.  I took mechanical engineering because I didn&#39;t want to sit in front of a computer all day...:rofl:  (and look at me now).  Cheers!</description>

              <p>Industry without earplugs, that brings back memories of loud clanking plastics molding machinery, we were told not to wear ear plugs so you would hear when something is going wrong. Like the sound of a screeching bearing falling appart, on a large motor about 5 ft long, 3 ft wide and high. They were a nightmare to work on....<img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/weary.png?v=5" title=":weary:" class="emoji" alt=":weary:">  !! <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/grin.png?v=5" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>
