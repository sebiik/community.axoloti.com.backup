    <description>Hi,

I just got an Axoloti Core today.  I followed the Getting Started page.  I loaded the library tutorial sine oscillator first.  I clicked &quot;Live&quot;, and it hung and ate up my cpu time.  I looked in the process list and it was doing make and just hanging.  So I closed it, unplugged and replugged in the board and started again. This time, I tried the demo&gt;sequencing&gt;303 patch, clicked live and it uploaded the patch.  It started playing music and then in the log window it said &quot;axoloti patch start taking too long, disconnecting&quot;, and then the program showed it was disconnected.  I couldn&#39;t do anything until I unplugged the board again.  I did this a few times.  Now, unfortunately, it gets a control transfer failed -9 then -7 error, and does the same thing, plays stuff but but axoloti patch start taking too long, disconnecting and i&#39;m disconnected again...  Any clue what&#39;s going on?  Did I do something wrong?

Thanks,
-m</description>
