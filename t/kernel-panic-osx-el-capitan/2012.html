        <p>I've just had my second instance of a kernel panic when (physically) reconnecting my Axoloti Core while the patcher is still running. On both occasions, I'd disconnected the Core hardware with the application still running, put the laptop to sleep, then some time later, woke the laptop up, and reconnected the USB cable from the Core. The laptop then spontaneously rebooted. On the second occasion, the OS X grey screen kernel panic notice was displayed. This didn't happen on the previous occasion, the machine just rebooted with no notice.</p>

<p>I have the system crash report, and can send if helpful.</p>

<p>System details:<br>3.06GHz MacBook Pro Core2 Duo ('Mid 2009')<br>4GB RAM<br>OS X 10.11.5 (El Capitan)<br>Java v.8 update 91</p>

<p>ouch... did you leave the Axoloti UI running in both occasions? when you disconnected the board, did it stay live or disconnect correctly?</p>

<p>unfortunately the truth is , Apple have screwed up here, a user land application should not be able to cause a kernel panic.<br>BUT unfortunately, the reality is, with 10.11 they rewrote the USB stack and it has caused endless issues, its got better as the minor updates have been released, but its still no where near as stable as 10.10 <img src="../../images/emoji/emoji_one/frowning5e1f.png?v=2" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> </p>

<p>Both my Eigenharp and Soundplane have similar issues, basically if you dont close the associated application El Capitan is likely to crash. (though thats down to isosychronous data, which is not used by axoloti), Ive been sending in detailed crash reports to Apple since the first release of 10.11, and only seen slight improvements since then.</p>

<p>the only thing we can check is the disconnection is properly dealt with, as its imperative in 10.11, you dont continue to attempt communicate with the device if its disconnected (I fixed this on the Eigenharp software, and it help alot).</p>

<p>what we are unlikely to be able to prevent, is if you put the mac to sleep whilst the board is connected and running, thats possibly going to cause issues.</p>

<p>also it may not be the axoloti code at all <img src="../../images/emoji/emoji_one/frowning5e1f.png?v=2" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> the axoloti appears as a core midi device, it could be this code that is crashing.<br>you could verify this by allowing axoloti to continue running the patch, by stopping the UI, and then doing a sleep... if it still kernel panics, then its unrelated to the axoloti UI.</p>

<p>sorry, might sound like 'excuses' but having been through this with the Eigenharp and Soundplane software, I know there  a few critical usb bugs still in 10.11, so its possible we may have little control over it.</p>

<p>Personally, Im hoping Apple have done some serious rework of the USB stack in 10.12, and thats why we have seen only minor improvements in 10.11, but i wont hold my breath.</p>

<p>(BTW: Id recommend users do not upgrade to 10.12 until the picture is clear on compatibility, Apple do not have a great track record these days with betas and initial releases, things tend to break)</p>

        <p>hey having the same issue.  entirely possible i am overlooking something.<br> i just got my axoloti and soldered up an axocontrol.<br>i purchased it second hand.</p>

<p>i am on el capitan and maybe 7 out of 8 times i've plugged the axoloti into the micro usb<br>my computer just shuts off and reboots.</p>

<p>i tried powering it via the dc first, then plugging in the usb. same result.<br>i dont wanna keep testing things and rebooting my computer.</p>

<p>i have gotten it to connect to the program and i've tested the axocontrol too.  everything seems good<br>the first time i plugged it in, it didn't do this.  but has since.  i also just unplugged it after connecting the device.<br>maybe not realizing that i should have disconnected it first before unplugging?<br>sorry for newbin' it.  just trying to understand whats going on better.</p>

        <p>have you tried without the axo control connected? is it possible you have shorted something whilst soldering?</p>

<p>I plug/unplug my Axoloti all the time with OS X with no issues. ( I use 10.12 these days)</p>

<p>as far as I know <a class="mention" href="../../u/toneburst.html">@toneburst</a> is the only one that has reported the mac panicking, and there are lots of mac users here.... I don't know how toneburst resolved the issue, or if he still has it.</p>

<p>with regards to my previous reference to os x crashing with usb, ive since determined, this only seems to occur with isosynchronous usb io, which Axoloti does not use. so as far as I'm aware, will not cause this.<br>so, I don't think running on another OS or OS version is going to make much difference... but of course you could try, perhaps something on your OS X install is broken (seems unlikely)<br>also, of course its wise to ensure you are on the latest version of 10.11, as Apple did improve the usb stack over its lifecycle.</p>

        <p>yo thanks for the clarity.  i am on 10.11.6 and theres no more updates for me at this time.<br>i had it reboot w/o the axocontrol before but i'll give it some more testing here.<br>i've triple and quadruple checked my joints at this point.</p>

<p>i just got home and gave my laptop a clean shutdown and then turned it on again.<br>i switched usb cables and took the axo control off.</p>

<p>okay now its been like 20-30 minutes.  seemed okay at first, but now have gotten it to reboot a handful of times.  seems more like 1 in 8 now.<br>thought i was onto something but the crashing seems random.  sometimes even reboots when i try to open the axo program w/ the device plugged in.  </p>

<p>behavior seems the same whether or not the axocontrol is on or off, screwed into the baseplate or not.</p>

<p>i'm gunna try my other computer and see if i get the same behavior.</p>

        <p>Might be worth trying to reinstall 10.11 on laptop , if you have narrowed it down <br>Or as you said before , a second boot partition with Linux.   </p>

<p>I don't think generally there is an issue with 10.11, and rebooting is not caused by user applications such as Axoloti/java   It's either hardware or drivers/kernel.   </p>

<p>Note: Axoloti installls no drivers</p>

        <p>I did have frequent kernel panics with my old laptop, running El Capitan. I've recently bought a new laptop, which came with Sierra.</p>

<p>I haven't had a chance to use the Axoloti with it yet, but it will be interesting to see if the Axo works ok with Thunderbolt 3 &gt; USB adapters.</p>

<p>I also have an oldish iMac with Sierra installed, which I was intending to use for synth editing, so I'll try that, too.</p>

        <p>Interesting ,  what year mbp  are we talking here ?</p>

<p>Perhaps 10.11 had an issue with that model mbp?</p>

<p>I've got an older mbp was ok, but is stuck at 10.10. <br>And a newer one which is still supported, which has been fine on everything.<br>similarly, I've an iMac stuck on 10.10, and a newer one , also not had any issues.  </p>

<p>.... though obviously, I usually use the newer machines, the others just for a bit of testing. </p>

<p>But perhaps is older macs with 10.11 that's a bad combo, so perhaps shifting back to 10.10 is the best solution.</p>

        <p>I think id be tempted to go for 10.10... i had numerous issues with the early versions of 10.11 (unreleased to axoloti) , which got better with minor updates, but perhaps for some hardware apple just didn't bother.</p>

<p>sorry, cant really come up with a better idea... sounds like axoloti is fine as its working with your other computer. <br>as i said, 'userland software' like axoloti should not be able to crash the mac, only the application... <br>thats more a symptom of hardware failure, or a bug in the operating system <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/frowningae52.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

        <p>A more complete sytem spec:<br>OSX 10.11.6 (15G1611)<br>MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2.53GHz, Mid 2009)<br>2.53 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo<br>2.53 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo</p>

<p>However, it's not something that happens a lot, so i'll just live with it. I now make sure the Axoloti Core is disconnected from the Patcher and also usually quit the patcher, before physically connecting the Core to the MacBook. That solves it for me.<br>The more annoying thing, and also one that is not really a big dea as it is solved with a single mouse click, is the nag screen to get xCode to use the git command even though that is not necessary. But, it's not a big deal. Neither will deter me at all from enjoying Axoloti!!</p>

<blockquote><p>the nag screen to get xCode to use the git command even though that is not necessary.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>really? id not realised it was doing that...though its quite possible (er, likely <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">) i have Xcode installed on all my machines.... but no one has mentioned this before (afaik)</p>

<p>what do you mean by 'to use the git command' ... are you issuing it manually -  within axoloti we use a library, and that should not be issuing git commands, and therefore require Xcode.</p>

<p>doh, its a pain, i don't have a 'clean' machine to try on... and really cannot face uninstalling xcode/reinstalling osx.</p>

<p>if this is an issue, you might want to try install the git command line tools, this will provide git, so presumably the nag will disappear... if that doesn't work, next best thing is the xcode command line tools (as opposed to Xcode), that is a small install too.</p>

        <p><a class="mention" href="../../u/thetechnobear.html">@thetechnobear</a> if you only install git, OS X will complain about xcrun not being installed, you have to install the Xcode command line tools, see here: <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/254380/macos-sierra-invalid-active-developer-path" rel="nofollow noopener">https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/254380/macos-sierra-invalid-active-developer-path</a></p>

        <p>Yeah been doing a quick search, appears a couple of uses mentioned this before. <br>such a pain, why are apple doing this... jgit does not need dev tools, so why prompt the user?</p>

<p>Unfortunately as I said before, even my old macs have Xcode on them from 'way back'  , so I've never encountered this.  </p>

<p>Doesn't look like a lot I can do about it <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/frowningae52.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

        <p>RE: the git/Xcode nag screen, I just get a dialog popping up when I launch the Patcher that prompts me to install Xcode in order to use git command line tools. As I said, it's just a small nuisance now that I know to ignore it! When I first downloaded the Patcher before I even received the Core, I saw it and thought I really needed Xcode. So I downloaded it and installed it on my iMac (running 10.10.x on it). So now I have Xcode, not that I'll ever use it <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> The drag was how long it took to download it on my miserably slow rural connection <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/open_mouthae52.png?v=5" title=":open_mouth:" class="emoji" alt=":open_mouth:"></p>

<p>Thanks to all for the input.</p>
