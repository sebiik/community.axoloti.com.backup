    <title>Multi-instrument patches?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/multi-instrument-patches/6951</link>
    <description>Being able to set subpatches to different channels is such a cool feature. It exponentially increases the ways that things done with the Axoloti. You can use synths drums, and samples all at once, and it&#39;s great to be able to use the same knobs for the instrument assigned to each channel.

Here&#39;s a patch that I use, with some oscillator-based drums and a polyphonic version of @mlinton&#39;s Minitaur patch. It also has an audio in which goes through the Repeater effect. The patch is best used with an external sequencer if available, but one can always be built into it as there&#39;s plenty of SDRAM available still.

Is anybody else making patches like this? Would love to see what&#39;s out there.</description>
