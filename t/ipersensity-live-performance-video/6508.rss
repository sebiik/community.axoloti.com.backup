    <title>Ipersensity - live performance video</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/ipersensity-live-performance-video/6508</link>
    <description>Hello,

I hope you are all well!

Ipersensity is a project of electronic improvised music by me (Daniele Pagliero) and Stefano Giust, one of the most important drummer in the free/experimental italian scene.

Here you can find a full live performance:

You can find more informations and credits on the video description.

I can give you some technical details, as the core of this last setup (the project is active since 2002) is the Axoloti, used in 3 different modes: 
- MIDI filter: it gets the notes from pads and transforms and routes to several MIDI devices,
- Synthesis: it acts like an 8 parts monophonic synth
- Effect: it gets an external audio and applies a granular delay

Thank you and a very special thanks to @johannes and all the people that contribute to the Axoloti project that is the best thing in terms of innovation and affordability.
Keep the good work going!!!

(mine is gone due to my bad soldering skill and I hope to get another very soon!!! ahahaha!!!)

love.
