    <title>Did I fry my DC part?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/did-i-fry-my-dc-part/5500</link>
    <description>I was just working on an axoloti project. My board was pwoered by 12V fro the dc input. I was trying to measure the 5V pins next the unused holes on the midi side of the board. Because I wasnt getting anything I was measuring the 5V and Ground on the Dc/midi part --&gt; main board pins.

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f53806e4b2c8625d961c4ee68d03f5dc114964ac.png&quot; width=&quot;367&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;

While doing so I accidently touched one of the middle pins with the multimeter and suddenly my board went off and wouldn&#39;t turn on anymore.

So I tried to power from usb, that did work. Question is: Did I fry the DC part somehow?</description>

              <p>Oh wow thanks alot! I have a some through hole 3.3V Zener diodes for protecting gpios here as a matter of fact, but I guess that could become a bit of a messy fix.<br>I'm not really experienced in smd soldering. The last time I tried hacking an smd delay pedal I screwed it up but maybe I can ask my more techy friends.<br>I live like 10min from a conrad, so I guess they either have an smd diode or can order it for me.</p>

              <p>Yes, you've blown D4 which is a 3.3V zener diode. Putting 5V on it without a limiting resistor destroyed it and it's failed short, acting like a low value resistor. Look at page 2 of the schematic:<br><a href="http://www.axoloti.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/axoloti-core-sch-v12.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">Axoloti Core v1.2</a></p>

<p>This has pulled pin 4 on U1 (ENABLE) low which is why there's no power. This also pulls pin 4 of U4 low that enables power using USB (according to the datasheet for this IC, it enables when pulled low.)</p>

<p>If you can get an SMD 3V3 zener diode and know what you're doing, it is an easy fix - the component can be handled with tweezers and a normal soldering iron. You could use a through-hole zener if you have one and bend and cut the leads short. If you want some cheap SMD zeners try eBay or Banggood:<br><a href="https://www.banggood.com/300pcs-LL34-SMD-Zener-Diode-Pack-Patch-Diode-Set-1N4148-Kit-12W-3-24V-15-Values-20pcs-Each-Value-p-1234344.html?rmmds=search&amp;cur_warehouse=CN" rel="nofollow noopener">Banggood cheap zener diodes</a></p>

<p>I reckon there's probably nothing else that's damaged.</p>

<p>There is 0V between gnd and vbusend. Resistance is 2.3ohm.</p>

<p>Idk which pins I exactly touched but yes it could have been vbussend and 5v. There is pinheaders soldered but I was measuring from the back.<br>After this i also checked if the 12v do arrives at the dc plug and I get the 12v so the psu is not the problem. </p>

<blockquote><p>On a positive note, if the rest of the board is fine, any damage is probably quite limited. Can you use the MIDI DINs?</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>That is true but without the dc input axoloti becomes practically useless for me because I use sensitive inputs like guitars with electromagnetic pickups and I always have noise from usb controllers and other noise when I power from 5v...</p>

<p>But propably this might be fixable?</p>

<p>Midi in at least is Stil working. I have fried complete boards too in the past so I want to try if I could just reuse their dc part.</p>
