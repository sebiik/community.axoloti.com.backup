    <title>V1.2 board getting very hot when headphone jack is used</title>

    <description>My v1.2 Axoloti just got very hot in the vicinity of the audio output jack, seemingly when I plugged something into the headphone jack. Everything seemed to be functioning properly otherwise except that there was a decent amount of high-pitched noise in the audio signal. No patch was running. I power cycled once to see if it the issue repeated, and it did. 

The headphone jack was connected to my audio interface, and both the interface and the Axo were plugged into the same USB hub, which was powering the Axo.</description>

              <p>I did eventually find this on the forum, but I don't recall reading it in any of the official/semi-official documentation:</p>

<p>But yes the problem was alleviated when I switched to the main outs. Thanks for the replies all.</p>

              <p>as far as I can remember, somewhere it's stated that this output should really only be used with certain headphones and not as a normal audio output as this could damage the board</p>

              <p>It's a known issue due to different voltage between the ground in headphone jack and other grounds in Axoloti.. </p>

<p>you can cut the traces and divert the signal from the regular output or just use an adaptor in order to get the audio from the "proper" output</p>
