    <title>Wiring questions</title>

    <description>For some reason, the phone speaker I soldered to the &quot;unconnected&quot; tip and sleeve of the audio output connects the two together, which results in the tip being grounded. The speaker worked fine last I checked, but would that weirdness have anything to do with why PA0 (a potentiometer) sometimes gets grounded when I wiggle my pots? I have PA0-PA7 all hooked up, sharing the same ground and same supply. I&#39;ve examined the connections, and I can&#39;t see any area where PA0 could get grounded.</description>
