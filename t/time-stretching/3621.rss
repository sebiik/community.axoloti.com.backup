    <description>Hey!

I was just discussing independent pitch &amp; time stretch in Axoloti with @Blindsmyth. I have made an object/alogrithm that should work in most cases. 

@rbrt I know you would like to implement independent pitch/stretch into your looper objects. Check this patch below out. Maybe you can use this idea for your object?

If anyone has something to contribute on this subject any ideas are welcome. My approach work all the way to 32X slower than original speed. But it seems like @SirSickSik is also making an object that uses about the same method as my idea which can go beyond the 32X stretch. I am looking forward to see how that works. But this is supposed to work as a general stretch algo, that can be implemented into any patch.

Anyway, here is my idea for general time stretch in any patch. It is pretty easy to set up, just check the patch:
