    <title>Smoothing inputs from MIDI controllers</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/smoothing-inputs-from-midi-controllers/3038</link>
    <description>What is the best way to smooth inputs from standard 7-bit (0-127) MIDI cc&#39;s? I have been experimenting with the existing smooth math object and slew. I only use it on parameters where it really matters though- pitch and filter frequency. It works but there&#39;s still some wobble, as opposed to outright stepping.

I guess for alternate approaches I could get a BCR2000 and st it up for 14 bit.

Soldering pots is really not what i wanna do, but I guess it&#39;s another option. Albeit one that would result in buying a backup core.</description>

<p>this is a 'double edged sword' ... interpolation/smoothing is not free, it costs cpu, which is a scarce resource on the STM32F4, so I prefer to put it in explicitly when required. (of course the exception is where its essential to the function e.g. a vca ), e.g from a cc input,  to a particular parameter on an object, sometimes that smoothed outlet can then also go to multiple inlets/objects.</p>

<p>I guess the 'ideal' option, would be an attribute which would enable/disable interp/smoothing code at compile time but this would have to be per parameter/inlet , which would clutter the object interface quite quickly.</p>

<p>its these kind of thing, where perhaps in some places,  the factory looks 'low level' rather than end-user friendly, but the advantage is that you can spend your cpu cycles where you need them.</p>

<p>( you can of course create your own subpatches to create smooth/interp versions which you find yourself using repeatedly)</p>

              <p>There are a few objects to help with this. The simplest of high pass filter will help you. </p>

<p>Type "smooth" into the new object filter and you may find the one I'm thinking of but can't remember for sure.</p>
