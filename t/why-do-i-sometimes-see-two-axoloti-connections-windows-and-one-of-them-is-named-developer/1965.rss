    <title>Why do I sometimes see two Axoloti connections windows? And one of them is named developer?</title>

    <description>Hello!

I noticed a couple of times that suddenly there is two connection windows open on my screen... One of them is called developer the other one is regular window. Sorry I cannot give a picture example now, cause I forgot to snap a picture of it. Will do next time. It have happened numerous times.

I think this is very mysterious. Does the developer have got any access to my computer besides of updating factory &amp; community library? Which is done when I push the sync libraries button and only then?

I mean this window. Next to the text &quot;Axoloti&quot; in the top of the second window that opens says (developer).

Thanks</description>

              <p>"Developer mode" detects the presence of a .git folder in the axoloti folder, if that's the case, it's supposedly a custom git clone and compile rather than an installed pre-compiled application. Developer mode unhides a few menu items that are useful for developers and potentially confusing for other users. That does not open access to your computer, no need to smile to your webcam <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=2" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
