    <title>Multiple Midi Controllers Working ! + Ableton Link and other dreams</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/multiple-midi-controllers-working-ableton-link-and-other-dreams/6514</link>
    <description>Hello there . Since a short time I got more and more into Axoloti.

Im Happy to share with you a solution made in python using a raspberry pi , and connecting several controllers to the pi and back to the axo , allowing multiple controllers to be used , and also extending on the same script I&#39;ve managed to talk back to the LaunchControlXL from the axo patcher through the pi .

[url=&quot;http://community.axoloti.com/t/raspberry-pi-as-hub-for-usb-midi-devices-advice/3110/8&quot;]All inspiration came from this post and the solution made by @lusol mentioned in this thread[/url]

I attach some pics and a demo video

[url=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/B-Flm68q_ps/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&quot;]VIDEO[/url]

Its a bit confusing but hopefully you get the idea

For anyone wanting to experiment here is the code in the github [url=&quot;https://github.com/CarloCattano/MultiMidi_Axoloti&quot;]GITHUB  CODE [/url]

1.
Now that Ive got what I need to run multiple controllers , I will try to experiment further into ableton link using puredata or a wrapper for python . Then small gates of 3.3v could be sent from the PI&#39;s GPIO&#39;s out to the axo and thats tempting to try for me , way easier and probably less messier than midi .

2. There is a wonderfull library called Maximilian written in C++ for audio synthesis that performs really well in the pi , i might start to go deeper into the possibility of also using it as an extra audio source , now that is there.

3. Changed my mind and now I guess I will put the oled displays on the pi side of things . I will keep one on the axo for waveforms and meters but the rest could be easily transfered into the Pi and use some comunication from the patcher to talk to the callbacks

**The code is still in proccess and its not meant to be ready to use for any case scenario , so you will have to add your controllers names on your own etc. Let me know here if you need some help with that .</description>
