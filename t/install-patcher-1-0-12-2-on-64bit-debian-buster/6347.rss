    <title>Install patcher (1.0.12-2) on 64bit debian buster</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/install-patcher-1-0-12-2-on-64bit-debian-buster/6347</link>
    <description>Since last time i ran the patcher, I upgraded my debian to buster. The current install worked on stretch (bot 64 bits), installed from source. At this point I haven&#39;t touched the &quot;old&quot; source tree on my disk, just added the udev rules.

Running Axoloti.sh outputs a LOT of java.logging in the terminal, but the patcher seems to open fine after a while. When trying to open a recent file, after another batch of a LOT of java.debugging nothing happens and the main axoloti window is un-responsive. Trying to to File-&gt;Quit outputs yet another batch of logging, but doesn&#39;t exit the window.

One thing I know changed is the fact that java 8 is not (easily) available
so I&#39;m running java 11. I&#39;m probably missing alot of other things (lib32bz2 is not available), so how to proceed?

Additional question/sidetrack: Would it be better to go for axoloti 2.0 or is that too experimental at this point?

I hope it&#39;s ok to ask from a birds eye perspective first...</description>

              <p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I went ahead and installed 2.0 (pre). Works fine, although some of my old patches won't load. Not that big a deal, I'm moving forward with new stuff, so...</p>
