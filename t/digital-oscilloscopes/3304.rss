    <description>ok, so for my axo projects i want a better oscilloscope...
ive got a DSO138, which was ok for getting me started, but i want something a little more accurate/steady

requirements... small buget, as its a hobby - its for audio work, so doesnt need to be super fast (i reckon 50mhz is more than i need!) , ideally it would have a signal generator

Id like a signal generator so i can feed ICs on a circuit without having to start running patches... also to check voltage outputs are within range, so i dont blow things up - i guess i could buy a separate generator, thoughts/recommedations?
(need to generate both ac/dc waves, simple saw/sine/pulse/sq is fine)

current front runners are Rigol/Siglent due to price... 
particularly:
Siglent SDS1202X-E (really good on paper!)
Rigol DS1052E (or variations)
Owon XDS3062A Plus

the SDS1202X-E seems to be a newer model, and a great price....
unfortunately the wavegenerator models are quite a bit more expensive (almost double price), and I cant really justify 700-800 euros.
(perhaps i just need to build a couple of signal circuits, and save the cash :) ) 

id prefer a digital scope really for the ease of measuring/comparison and clarity of the display. 
Id also prefer standalone rather than connect to my Mac, just dont want to risk blowing up a computer!

<p>I'd recommend if you don't really need a standalone scope, and want something that can help you explore circuits. Good bit of kit !</p>

<p>hmm, that does look really interesting... Im a bit wary of connecting any of my circuits to my mac,  but I'd assume the mac is some how isolated from the circuit. (I dont dont see any complaints of people blowing up their pcs ) </p>

<p>its a bit of a pity that they appear to have a problem using this on a PI3 (software is available) , as that would be pretty perfect... and less of a worry, that said, looks like the BBB works, and it may be the TinkerBoard I have will too.</p>

<p>definitely a serious consideration, having the wavegenerator is a really plus.</p>

              <p>Hey Mark - </p>

<p>I'd recommend checking out the Analog Discovery 2 from Digilent: <a href="http://store.digilentinc.com/analog-discovery-2-100msps-usb-oscilloscope-logic-analyzer-and-variable-power-supply/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://store.digilentinc.com/analog-discovery-2-100msps-usb-oscilloscope-logic-analyzer-and-variable-power-supply/</a></p>

<p>In addition to a scope, you get a logic analyzer, waveform generator and some other functions. With their BNC adapter, you can use standard scope probes. The corresponding app, Waveforms 2015, is actually pretty well done and will run on Windows, Mac and Linux. You can run it in demo mode without having the real hardware to check it out.</p>

<p>I have the Siglent Technologies SDS1052DL as well which has been pretty solid. IIRC, it's similarly spec'd to that entry level Rigol.</p>

<p>Best,<br>Nick</p>
