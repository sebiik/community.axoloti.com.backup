    <title>Sending Midi Clock to APK Mini?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/sending-midi-clock-to-apk-mini/5348</link>
    <description>I currently use the drj/seq/tap_tempo to generate my clock with taps on a gpio footswitch - how would I go about sending this clock to my Akai Apk Mini via USB?  I can set the mini to sync to external clock for the arp but I can&#39;t seem to get the keyboard to receive the clock.  I think I&#39;ve tried all the options on the drj/midi/clock_tx clock transmitter object with no luck (though I was able to send the clock out via 5pin midi with this set up before).  

Maybe this is an issue with the keyboard can&#39;t receive a certain type of clock?  Thanks for the help!</description>

              <p>Just wanted to bump this as I am still looking for a solution...is there a way to get the midi clock out to the keyboard from the axo usb?</p>

<p>Or, going the opposite way - is there a way to possibly send the tap tempo clock from the keyboard to the axo? either way would be really helpful</p>

<p>Still having problems with the drj/seq/tap_tempo being accurate so it may actually be better to get the clock from the keyboard as the tap works fine on there, though would MUCH rather have the tempo on a footswitch so I can set it without stopping playing (and I just keep better time with my foot)</p>

<p>EDIT:  or if anyone has a better option for a tap clock in the axo that could send out via usb as well as sync delays/osc/etc in the axo that'd be awesome...so far I haven't seen an alternative for the drj tap</p>
