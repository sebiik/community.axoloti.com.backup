    <title>2-Way Connection Between Objects Possible?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/2-way-connection-between-objects-possible/1834</link>
    <description>I&#39;d like to create a pair of objects that are able to pass K-Rate data between them in both directions. It&#39;s occurred to me that is might not be possible though, due to execution order. Is this the case, and if so, is there any workaround?

              <p>Again, bit obscure.<br>This was another way I thought I could integrate different word libraries for my LPC objects.</p>

<p>The idea would be to have a generic playback object, then I'd roll each library into it's own object, emulating to some extent the way the early TI 'Speak &amp; Spell/Read' etc. products worked, with a central controller requesting groups of bits from the ROM controller, which maintained its own pointer to the data stored in memory, then passing them on to the synthesiser chip. For that to work, though, there has to be 2-way communication between the two objects.</p>

<p>My motivation isn't entirely about slavishly emulating the setup of the original hardware, I just though it was a nice idea to be able to produce add-ons to the object set with different voices and words in the form of simple objects, like the additional word ROMs you could buy for those TI products.</p>

<p>What I'll probably end up doing is just producing different versions of the playback object, with each one containing a single library. It's not as neat a solution, though, as the object then requires 12 outgoing connections, rather than 1 in and 1 outlet, as I had originally envisaged (though other 'Talkie' (provisional name) objects already require 12 or more connections).</p>
