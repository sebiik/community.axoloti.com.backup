    <title>Probability Trigger</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/probability-trigger/459</link>
    <description>I made a subpatch for spicing up melodic or rhythmic sequences with probability.

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/1X/e0f9e24d88d5d3a0f09d84e807f39b26d6715437.png&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; height=&quot;70&quot;&gt; 

Feed this subpatch with a trigger gate and the corresponding clock (to allow retriggering of consecutive triggers) and a positive probability float value. The trigout will hit randomly with the given probability: probability 64 = every time a trigger comes in, 32 = probability is 50% or 6 means about 10% - and of course 0 is never. It&#39;s good for producing sort of ghost notes in drum loops.

The &quot;vol&quot; volume outlet reflects the given probability value and you can patch it to a vca for volume control. So you can play less probable notes softer. It&#39;s fun, when you set the probability in a sequencer set-up with for example a &quot;sel xx fp&quot; to get variations in your drum loop. The attached simple demo patch shows a set-up like this. But it can also be used for melodic note triggering.

Have fun,
Peter
