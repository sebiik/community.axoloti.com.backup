    <title>Unlisted midi controller - is it really not working?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/unlisted-midi-controller-is-it-really-not-working/6410</link>
    <description>Hello everybody,

I have this 1999 Behringer class 2 mixer with midi out and I wanted to try to connect it to the Axoloti (note, I&#39;m a complete noob) Maybe for that to work was quite optimistic in the first place, but I don&#39;t really know how all of this works (yet) and I thought well if it has a midi out I can connect it and it&#39;s going to work... Well...

I have all the latest versions installed and worked through the topics I could find on midi devices (it&#39;s not listed as compatible, neither as uncompatible)

In the patch I used a midi in monitor. I read in another post that it shows the incoming data on the console, which is the little window that opens first when you start the program I reckon. However no data shows up when I do stuff on the mixer. Now, I don&#39;t know if I have to put different settings on the mixer or maybe change something in the program or if it&#39;s just not going to work with this old mixer. I just find it very hard to give that idea up....

Maybe someone with more experience can tell me what is going on... Thanks for your effort!!</description>

              <p>if it has a DIN midi plug it should work. compatibility issues can come from non standard USB-Midi devices. so can you test if the mixer works with another piece of gear, i.e. a computer with a midi device connected or a hardware synth?</p>
