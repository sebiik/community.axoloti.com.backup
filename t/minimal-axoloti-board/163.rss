    <title>Minimal axoloti board</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/minimal-axoloti-board/163</link>
    <description>Hello
Is there a plan to release a kind of axoloti minimal dev board?
I mean, an axoloti brick without headphone/audio jacks nor power, midi and USB host on board connector ?
The idea would be to be able to integrate that brick in any kind of case (eurorack?) Without the risk/pain of having to desolder connectors.
This allow to chose the necessary input/output when needed</description>

              <p>I'd also be interested in a second AxoCore board without the large components soldered in ( MIDI, Audio, USB ). But I understand <a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> concerns when it comes to stock. Also these also happen to be the larger, and probably easier items to desolder from the board.</p>

<p>My plan is to replace all of them with 3.5mm jacks for audio / midi for a low-profile axo board. Also pretty much all of my gear uses 3.5mm stereo cable for audio, and a larger and larger percentage is using 3.5mm stereo jack as MIDI breakout as well.</p>

              <p>Hey guys, </p>

<p>I really love the concept of this device and here is my message I'd put into the suggestion box:</p>

<p>I'm dreaming constantly about a small and simple board to fulfil my needs. And yes the big DIN sockets or the host USB or 1/4" TRS seems big, or could I have them on some other sides? Or different type of input/output connectors ( ex.1.: XLR -&gt; mic preamp -&gt; Axoloti ADC; ex.2.: Phono stereo in - 2X RCA -&gt; Amp ... )<br>Or I prefer the 1/4" headphones jack(like major box-shaped instruments have it (so during sound check could be easier just listen in, where the brumm appears/which cable is sh*t))?<br>Reasons: what if I'd make a small object with all the external plus electronics inside the "box" (speaker, wifi, blinking LED-s). So I could think a tonnes of different scenarios when a minimalist design would be helpful.</p>

              <p>I don't think it has to be (or could be) <em>that</em> small. But something along the lines of the OWL "digital board" posted above, or the <a href="https://www.sonic-potions.com/shop/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=59&amp;product_id=58" rel="nofollow">LXR one</a>, would be neat, I suppose. </p>

<p>As for "skiff friendly", I'd say that'll have less to do with the size of the "core" but the remainders of the module. Many DIYers are still adverse to SMD, but that's the main factor in keeping things small. As far as I can see, Paul (euxoloti) might have crammed everything into just one board, but I presume he went the dual (or well, triple) sandwich route because that'll entice more people to actually build one.</p>

              <p>IMO there are two main reasons why the  Eurorack kids want a minimum Axo board (out of cost)<br>In Eurorack the tendency is to have modules as small as possible. 1hp (5.08mm) of space in a Euro cabinet, cost a medium of 2â‚¬ (usually more) and people who play live want as much modules as possible in minimum space.</p>

<p>For the same reason (size) people like modules "skiff friendly" that means as thin as possible.</p>

<p>Also, most of the times we don't need a complete synth voice in a module but more simple functions ( maybe just trigger generators etc ) so all the external DAC memory etc is just useless.</p>

<p>In this scenario a <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp.html" rel="nofollow">teensy++2,0</a> style/ size board , programmable in Axoloty way, should be a dream. Even if it cost little more than teensy (teensy++ 2.0 cost 24$)<br>This can became the hearth as the "digital board" of many new modules easy to make and program.</p>

              <p>I think also, that a raw compact core board will be much better for implementing axoloti to the eurorack world. But the break away part design from johannes is a good compromise. I think, it will take time that people know, what they are want to use their axoloti for. <br>Last friday, I visited schneidersladen in berlin and talked with some people about the axoloti. They haven't heard about it before, but after it, they were very interested in it. They also said, that they like the graphical interface method but don't want to work on electronics.</p>

<p>An other big potential which I want to mention is, that the axoloti and its environment is a good place for young people. At the moment the graphical interface is a bit rough and unappealing but on the other side it has many potential (e.g. learning curve, open source, price, community etc.). In the future, I want to develop a I/O board, where you can easily connect switches, potis etc. by simple <a href="http://d32zx1or0t1x0y.cloudfront.net/2011/05/extending_terminal_blocks_01_lrg.jpg" rel="nofollow">terminals</a> without the fear of overvoltage the axoloti inputs.

<p>(I dont think, faster or more sdram is really a motive, as arguably these could be both added to a v2 axoloti core board rather than a variant)</p>

<p>And it's unclear to me why this ( = smaller "core") isn't about eurorack (?) </p>

<p>Anyways, as far as I am concerned it's about not cost but ease-of-integration. And it would be useful of course to have some of the signals available for panel mount sockets (SDIO, USB). </p>

<p>As for DIYing the core .. well, maybe, but unlikely. I suppose there's DIY-friendlier, non-BGA SDRAM, but it's still TSSOP and the market for that kind of thing is really small.</p>

              <p>ok, moved the above posts here, as I think its more appropriate, since was not really about eurorack etc.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/diego">@Diego</a> its a possibility, but they will still 'suffer' the same limitations as johannes, sure they can produce their own boards, but if they want to sell them, why do you think their production costs will be lower? Johannes has already said, he thinks it would only reduce the cost by 3-5 euros...  and the market seems small, only about 5 people on this thread... so seems production run would be low ... 50 boards? <br>then of course the software would need to (potentially) be altered if any hardware change was made, and then distributed...</p>

<p>I see it unlikely that more than a few such custom boards would be made, seems much easier to just take a axoloti core, and desolder and remove the parts you don't want.<br>I think much more likely a eurorack axoloti has viability as a variant, since that will appeal to a new market.</p>

<p>but this is just as a casual observer, so its quite possible/likely I'm wrong.</p>

              <p>I could think of a dozen design variations. My design goal was a board that does not require any soldering, feature-rich, and serving as many use cases as reasonably possible. Additional design variations require significant time and investment: design, prototyping, testing, test-jig development, manufacturing, testing, stock... Unless there is a large demand, I will stick to a single "core" variation. Most relevant signals are available on pads, the power/midi section can be cut off, other connectors can be removed to save vertical space.</p>

              <p>i don't know if this is still needed, but to me it is, as i am wanting minimal modules (only mcu/dac/gnd isolation/usb/volt reg/icsp header and some analog pins broken out)<br>note: no extra ram! (aka, the bare minimal needed)</p>

<p>here's my personal reasons:<br>space is a luxury to me<br>i don't need he midi dins, jack conenctors, microsd, it takes just too much space when i can simply use header pins for the jack sockets and midi.<br>cost reduction per pcb? (fewer components needed, smaller pcb size)</p>

<p>my plan with a few of these modules would be:<br>use them as simple oscillators/adsr envelopes/filters/compressor.<br>while using a axoloti core as effect processor (with the help of the DRAM)</p>

<p>if i need to get this with axoloti core modules on their own, it will:<br>require more space<br>require more money(?)<br>not be used to it's potential (if i use a axoloti core as a polyvoice oscillator, i down't need all the features like DRAM, sd, ect)</p>

<p>quick drawing of what i'd love to have (size: about 50x50mm):<br><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6fe411a53ea870272c535ca4a72ea7f9d318aeaa.png" width="312" height="323"></p>
