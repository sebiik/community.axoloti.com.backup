    <title>Live performance MIDI Sequencer for Audiothingies DoubleDrummer</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/live-performance-midi-sequencer-for-audiothingies-doubledrummer/4926</link>
    <description>I just pretty much finished another MIDI sequencer project, using the Akai MIDI Mix USB controller, in preparation of a live show I&#39;m playing in October with VLK.

It&#39;s a drum sequencer for the [Audiothingies DoubleDrummer](https://www.audiothingies.com/product/doubledrummer/), which I plan to load up with some fun percussion samples. The Axoloti sequencer can play six voices and for each voice, I can send even clock division triggers (/32, /16, /8, etc.) and &quot;uneven&quot; ones (just a bunch of custom divisions I like), based on a generated MIDI clock. I can also shift each voice&#39;s pattern, so that it doesn&#39;t overlap exactly with another sound, or plays between beats. On top of this (or actually below ;) ), there is a fader which sets the chance for a random trigger to be sent to the voice on any MIDI clock pulse. This can be very off-beat, so I also programmed the right-most fader to quantize all triggers of all voices into even beats - again by using clock divisions like /2, /4, /8, /16, etc. The regular triggers and random triggers can be muted separately for each voice with the push of a button. Additionally, there&#39;s a chance-based sample randomizer which can load a different sample into a voice and I can control the DoubleDrummer&#39;s built-in master LPF, Crusher and Reverb.

This lets me create a very wide variety of rhythms quickly, by simply turning a bunch of knobs and depending on the master quantizer and random trigger chances, I can make sure that nothing bad happens ... or just a little bit ... or a whole lot of messed up rhythms :D 

On a different MIDI channel, there is also a random CC20 value being generated as well as a random (but lockable) melody, based on certain trigger combinations. I use this to add some additional (semi-)randomness to my [AE Modular synth](https://www.tangiblewaves.com/), which will also be part of the show, and which has a built-in MIDI-CV interface.

Here&#39;s a quick demo video:

              <p>Hey, sorry for the suuuuper late reply. I went into a different direction with the project as I figured that I could simply play back samples with the Axoloti too and not use the DoubleDrummer at all, which was more convenient.</p>

<p>I'm currently in the process of consolidating and sharing various projects of mine and you can find this project (with sample playback by the Axoloti) on my GitHub:<br><aside class="onebox whitelistedgeneric">

<p>Adding MIDI sequencing into my Axoloti patch is very easy. Just scroll down to the sample player modules and exchange them for MIDI Out Note modules.</p>

              <p>Yeah, the MIDI Mix is really great for the Axoloti <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  Cheap and lots of controls, plus LEDs which you can turn on and off by simply sending it certain MIDI notes.</p>

<p>There is a free editor for the MIDI Mix from the Akai website which is easy to use. I just set up the CCs for the controls sequentially, (1-8 from left to right, +10 for each row) so that they are easy to remember. I then route them to device specific CCs or notes (for the external synths on DIN MIDI) in the Axoloti patch.</p>

<p>What you can't change are the LED on/off note values, for example for the MUTE buttons (velocity 127 sets the LED on), and the special button notes (e.g. BANK LEFT), but those were easy to figure out:</p>

<p>Axoloti MIDImix LED MIDI note values</p>

<pre><code>        1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8</code></pre>

<p>Mute:        -63    -60    -57    -54    -51    -48    -45    -42<br>Solo:        -62    -59    -56    -53    -50    -47    -44    -41<br>Rec Arm:    -61    -58    -55    -52    -49    -46    -43    -40</p>

<p>Bank Left: -39<br>Bank Right: -38</p>

<p>Button Note Numbers:<br>Bank Left: C#0 (25)<br>Bank Right: D 0 (26)<br>Solo: D#0 (27)</p>

              <p>Thanks! I always felt like I couldn't be as spontaneous with the linear step sequencers on stage, without having spent a lot of time for preparation beforehand. Could be that I'm just bad at it, but this solution here definitely produces a lot more varied results quickly, although at the expensive of precise sequence control. But I don't need that anyway <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>
