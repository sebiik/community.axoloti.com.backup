    <title>Loud hum when playing back soundfile + other noisiness issues</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/loud-hum-when-playing-back-soundfile-other-noisiness-issues/3141</link>
    <description>Testing **play fn** for simple WAV playback. While the file is playing there is a terrible buzz that sounds something like a distorted sawtooth. The buzz is as loud as the sound material in the file, and it stops as soon as the sound is finished playing.

I was hoping (for an installation) to be able to combine playback of WAVs with audio thru from electret condenser mics, blending realtime soundscape with other binaurally treated sounds. 

I have two electrets connected and working (having obtained a couple of the SparkFun ones) but they are also quite noisy. Not self-noise hiss -- the mics are certainly noisy -- but a continuous quiet buzz, mostly in the left channel.

I fear unless I can eliminate the noise problems that the Axoloti won&#39;t be useful for this project. Any help is welcome!</description>

              <p>Thanks for the suggestion but I think that the inconfig mic object has to do more with bias voltage, which I don't need to worry about since the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12758" rel="nofollow noopener">SparkFun electrets</a> I am using handle that on their own little circuit boards. </p>

<p>I tried rewiring the electrets with better shielded cable and that didn't help a great deal. Disconnected them and tried a pair of dynamic mics connected to the TRS jack, and that works much better. Much less of the hum and no interference when I run the audio file. The general background noise level from the mics themselves is quite high.</p>

              <p>OK... so the bad hum when playing back the audiofile is happening as part of the mic thru signal. The audiofile playback on its own is clean. So I need to track down why the playback interferes with the mic signals. </p>

<p>I'll have to try with some dynamic mics attached to the main input jack as well.</p>

<p>(BTW there is definitely no clipping going on and a sine tone sounds fine.)</p>

              <p>Thanks for the reply. I'll check the things you suggest.</p>

<p>The audiofile I'm using is definitely 48/16.</p>

<p>Here's my little <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8pdcnjf4zmu2e4d/audio%20thru%20test.axp?dl=1" rel="nofollow noopener">test patch</a> and the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/fof9726n90lwjml/squeaks16bit.wav?dl=1" rel="nofollow noopener">audiofile</a> (dropbox links)</p>

<p>The test patch has basic audio thru from the microphones, plus addition of a highpass filtered version to boost high end as the mics are lacking above 10K.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8rxu23iit6mgznf/axoloti%20hum%20demo.mp3?dl=1" rel="nofollow noopener">recording of the axoloti output</a> demonstrating the problems.</p>

              <p>sounds odd... and certainly not an issue ive faced with playback</p>

<p>you need to narrow down the problem slightly.</p>

<p>play a simple sine osc to output - check this is not <br>if this is distorted, look at your gain levels on output etc.</p>

<p>if not, then we know its not axo hardware related, since the audio output path is ok<br>so you need to check the wav file, ensure it is a 48k raw 16 bit mono file. <br>(various threads on the forum about preparing raw files for playback with audacity etc.)</p>

<p>use a scope on the output of table play, check to see if its clipping, if not, try to add a gain after, to reduce gain level.</p>

<p>another 'tip' in patch settings, try turning off 'saturation', which increase gain on patch, if your patch has high gain levels/combines a few audio sources, this can be problematic</p>

<p>to get further, you probably need to post your patch and wav file.<br>also it'd be useful to see a screenshot of the scope connected to the play, so we can see if its clipping.</p>

<p>I cant say anything about the mics, except there is an audio in config object which you should look at to adjust gain etc.... again, I use axo as an fx with audio in, without any buzzing etc.</p>
