    <title>Some Start and End Point Questions</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/some-start-and-end-point-questions/4202</link>
    <description>Imagine the most simple sampling patch ever, where all it does is record to a table and let you play it back.

Easy enough, but now I want to add two dials to it, one to set the playback Start point of the sample, and one to set the Stop point.  Then, I want to be able to discard the waveform data that falls outside the Start and Stop points so that I can save the resulting sample to the SC card.

- Record sample
- Set Start point using dial A
- Set End point using dial B
- Discard all sample data that falls before the Start point, and after the End point
- Save edited sample to SD</description>
