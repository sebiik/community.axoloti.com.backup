    <title>Answered: Anyone have a to-scale drawing of the Axoloti&#39;s port array?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/answered-anyone-have-a-to-scale-drawing-of-the-axolotis-port-array/3584</link>
    <description>I&#39;m creating a case, and the axoloti is to be mounted against a CNC&#39;d metal plate, with holes for each port.

Has anyone (perhaps the inventor) made a graphic file (bitmap or vector) with a properly scaled drawing of the ports? I can try and caliper it out but I&#39;m afraid of making mistakes and wasting a $30 part. I do know that I&#39;ll want to build in some space around each one so that cables fit.

Thanks a mill, I think this build is going to be a blast,

              <p>Thank you for your efforts in getting these measurements down! Much appreciated. And I'll definitely post some pictures as it gets built. <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>It's shaping up to be a 6-button, two switch, 10-knob affair. It's being built in a chunky Hammond box with a flat aluminum lid that everything mounts to, cut by FPE. I'll be loading it with patches that all share the same simple control layout. Just a sort of do-anything preset-able synth/effect/weirdobox for my live sets, with very immediate controls.</p>

              <p>Hi</p>

<p>Good to see my design/measurements getting reused! </p>

<p>Please be aware of that the measurements were done of my own Axoloti board. I've noticed that someone had a slight offset on some port(/s?). So he had to file his panel a bit. Best option is to print it out (from the FPD freeware = front panel design software) on paper, cut out the holes with a small knife. Try with the paper on your own board. Then you should notice any differencies. Adjust (on your copy of the FPD file) and repeat. Please note that you can set your own grid resolution in your FPD for very precise adjustments (I think I had mine on 0,25mm).</p>

<p>Hope it all works out for you and good luck! And if you don't mind, please share an image on that thread you linked! IMHO, it's inspiring to see everyones version/solution.</p>
