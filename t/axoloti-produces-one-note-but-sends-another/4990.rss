    <title>Axoloti produces one note, but sends another</title>

    <description>Hi there!

So I&#39;ve finished my patch and I love it. BUT I&#39;m having a VERY weird behaviour!

When I connect my PC to the device and listen to the sounds it&#39;s generating it seems to work fine. But if I unplug my headphones from it and plug them into the synths it&#39;s sending it&#39;s midi signals to, it seems to be running an older version of my patch!

How is this possible?!?! I&#39;ve uploaded the most recent version of the patch to the flash memory, but it doesn&#39;t seem to overwrite the old one? 

Very weird - does this sound familiar to anyone?</description>

              <p>Ok, trying this BUT the only "as startup" option is to upload to the SD card... but mine doesn't have an SD card in it (and never has) so how have I managed to have a program saved onto it before? Essentially are we saying I need to get me an SD card to make it work properly? </p>

<p>It seems really weird the device seems to be doing 2 things differently simultaneously... I have a note delay function in my patch that remembers the last few notes that were played and holds them back to play on later midi keyboard presses. I've got a load of display items in the patch to tell me what note it THINKS it's going to be outputting and everything from them seems to be working - only when I have it plugged in via midi to a synth, it's clearly holding back notes and doing something completely different to what it's displaying in the editor... Like I mentioned previously, I can even listen to the Axoloti's note output and hear that it's working as expected, then just switch the headphones over to the synth (that's plugged in at the same time) and see that it's doing the wrong thing... :s</p>
