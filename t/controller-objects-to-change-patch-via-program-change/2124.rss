    <title>Controller objects to change patch via program change</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/controller-objects-to-change-patch-via-program-change/2124</link>
    <description>&lt;strike&gt;ok, i use the controller/pgmchange subpatch from johannes as a controller object and have all my patches saved to sdcard (after adding the controller object to the preferences). one patch is saved as startup patch. when i put one of the patches in live mode, i can see that the controller object is used...
&lt;strike&gt;
if i plug the axoloti in, the first patch works as expected, but as soon as i send a program change the axoloti goes silent. with this solution https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/help-with-program-change-and-patch-load/1961 i get the same behaviour. i also tried to create a patch-bank but this also does not work.
&lt;strike&gt;
sorry for this post, but i could not find an obvious answer in the forum (or i think i did everything right)&lt;/strike&gt;

EDIT: forget this post, it does indeed work. i somehow managed to miss the upload patch bank button on the top of the patch-bank editor. stupid me! sorry for the noise</description>
