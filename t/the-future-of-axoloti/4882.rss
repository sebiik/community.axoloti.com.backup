    <title>The future of Axoloti?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/the-future-of-axoloti/4882</link>
    <description>Hi Guys,

I&#39;ve just finished the racked version of my Axoloti, now it runs smoothly in my studio.
Last evening tried a few patches, old noodles, etc., and actually came across my old problem with the platform, that I almost forgot : (for me) it seems, if you&#39;re not a regular forum member, you&#39;re kinda&#39; lost.

The patching software is a bit outdated, can&#39;t really see any progress there, yet, there is a lot of potential in it, like better graphics, more stable operation, etc.
It is unbelievable that I can&#39;t double click on a patch to load it into the patcher software. Maybe it is just me and my system, I don&#39;t know, but it is really frustrating.

My other problem is the &quot;jungle&quot; of patches, sub patches, modules, user modules, libraries, etc. I mean, again, maybe it&#39;s just me, but I just need something more ... how to say it in a polite way, easy to use, maybe?

In my studio, I also have a MicroModular and honestly, the Axoloti is MUCH more powerful than that little box, but, far more hard to use. I mean, on Mac, even with a WineBottled editor, it is far more stable than the modern Axoloti.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love this thing. It has given me so much fun-time, but compared to other things in my studio, it is not really user friendly...hah, actually, that is the expression I was looking for : Axoloti has to be more user friendly. 
I don&#39;t know, maybe the creator of the project could involve others into the development of the patcher, I don&#39;t really know, I&#39;m not an expert.

Just another thing comes in mind right now is the sub-patcher - patcher thing...I know, you can copy the sub-patchers into your folder and you can point the software&#39;s search path to the folder, yet, you can&#39;t really create single file patches...I mean, for me, and again, forgive me, I do not want to be rude, but the whole thing is sooooo nerdy, it is literally a jungle, sometimes, a mess to handle.

I am pretty sure, this could be a true replacement of the Nord, but now, it is &quot;just another crazy DIY DSP thing...&quot; and honestly, seems a bit &quot;abandoned&quot;?

Guys, sorry if I was emotional, but...you know, I just wanted to be honest.</description>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/u/lokki">@lokki</a><br>That's interesting. SPI is definitely possible but would be irritating for a lot of users I think. Just glancing at the data sheet again for the MCU, the hardware supports USB 2.0 both full and high speed (one interface is full speed only which should still be able to handle basic stereo usb audio). Axo implements both a usb device and a usb host. Maybe people were referring to some limitation coming from the current firmware. Or perhaps it's forced to run more slowly when both interfaces are in use, etc. </p>

<p>Also, what do we mean by usb audio exactly? One meaning to me is something like Axo being able to act like a standard usb audio interface when plugged into a host pc. Another meaning is exchanging audio data over usb between host and slave Axos (either in a linear chain or connected via a hub to the master)</p>

<p>I'll need to do a deeper dive into the usb stack again to figure out where the limitations might be for audio. I'm skeptical that it's outright impossible for a hardware reason.</p>

<p>i thought the consensus was (from prior discussions) that usb-audio is not going to be possible, since axoloti only has usb-1. the connection to use would be the spi port...</p>

<p>Are you asking specifically about inter-axo communication? Like how long that would take to implement? I need more to go on with respect to what you think that feature looks like. I haven't reviewed the status of that feature or any of the past discussions. There are a few different ways to achieve it I think. Are you thinking that there is some mechanism in the patcher that basically represents an "output" that targets some "input" running in a second patch but that that second patch is actually on some other Axo device? That's kind of the most general thing I can think of. That all of the usual data streams that exist in the patcher can be communicated across the channel and into a "remote" patch context. It would help me to understand if there are sub goals there that would be valuable to have alone. Like is being able to send audio back and forth alone worth doing as a starting point?</p>

<p>Then there is the question of exactly how the devices are connected. I'm not sure what people were discussing in the past. The second Axo could be a USB slave to the master for example. That seems like probably the most user friendly way to do it. Make it possible to just chain as many as you like together via USB.</p>

              <p>That sounds exciting. Granted i am kinda easy to get excited over anything related to my synth build these days haha.</p>

<p>Seriously though, i think inter-axo sync and communication should be a pretty high priority. It would make the platform exponentially more powerful, imagine, for 60EUR per stereo 24/48 pair people could build a modular audio interface. I saw a couple people asking for this.  While i have no use for more parallel analog I/O myself, with the same sync i could build the flagship synth i want, with all the great OSC modules, best filters and effects, 16 voice poly, use the full 8mb SDRAM per single sampler OSC.... or just link 3 axos for the perfect hifi loopxbox with the best effects and the third one controlling your lightshow (while clearly possible that last part might still better be outsourced to a dedicated arduino or whatever. but yall get it).</p>

<p>So i have no real experience in developing (aside from the turbo pascal/assemler 3d engine i wrote 25 years ago lol), i can see this is a big task already and just my personal favourite. <a class="mention" href="/u/urklang">@urklang</a> what do you expect how much time that would take if you think of it from a 9-5 5 days a week perspective? i know this is impossible to precisely estimate, so just a rough guess.  i know it can take me up to a full day to find the missing +1 that was fucking up my code...</p>

<p>I appreciate the sentiment. If there are specific small features that users want to crowdfund, I'm available to get those done, but have limited time for it overall. Some of my opinions about the future direction of the Axoloti codebase require bigger time commitments that I'm not prepared to make at the moment. The good news is that I've been busy with some other hardware/software projects that will definitely be of interest to Axoloti users. When that stuff is fully public, that will be a way to support me doing further development of projects like this and more open source work. I'll post more on the forums here to keep everyone updated as that progresses.</p>

Me personally and i'm sure quite a lot of the owners leaning more to the "user" side would happily spend some extra money for improved software, given how affordable everything is in the first place.

<p>obviously this won't come up with a proper developer salary for the thousands of hours probably needed for this but it might help a bit?</p>

              <p>A port to other STM devices or even other MCU platforms entirely is definitely possible. My feeling is that the DSP code itself would be reasonably portable to other ARM devices that support the CMSIS DSP library. Chibios, the realtime os Axoloti uses, supports many other devices, so in theory much of the Chibios code could be reused.</p>

<p>I think the basic approach of having the patcher generate firmware source which is then compiled could be improved upon. That approach is very tied to the particular hardware target we have right now. The patcher is very coupled to hardware and the toolchain for that hardware. In the future, I'd like to do something that is more like a proper API, i.e. future hardware targets expose a common API and various clients (one of which would be the visual patcher) could make calls to it. Supercollider's architecure is like this (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider#Architecture" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider#Architecture</a>), there is a clear distinction between the low-level synthesis server and the high-level client language.</p>

I tried to build it a few weeks ago, ran into a snag, gave up and tried to ping the dev. Haven't heard back so it may be a dead project.</p>

<p>It might be unrealistic to actually do all that DSP without specific optimization for ARM which will be tough without having Andrew on board. The raw GLFW UI tech itself is cool though and would probably be useful on SBCs in a more minimal form. Philosophically the "skeumorphic" design idea of having everything look like Eurorack isn't my favorite thing. There's no user abstraction mechanism at all; you're just stuck with the finished modules. But that makes it way more approachable to people who know Eurorack and don't care about any sort of "programming language"-like functionality.</p>

<p>I prefer something like Axoloti then, where all that UI stuff, which IMO is secondary in a musical applications, is toned down, focus is on the audio processing.</p>

              <p>Sounds like an interesting longer term plan. <br>Agreed that Rack is pretty impressive as a project. To be clear, though, it can’t run on a Pi and VCV core dev Andrew Belt has explicitly said he won’t target SBCs. (Although, this was a few months ago. Would be surprising if he’s had a change of heart.)</p>

<p>SuperCollider does work on the Pi and scsynth is used by Sonic Pi, which is included in the base Raspbian and Ubuntu MATE distros.</p>

              <p>This is exactly the kind of thing that would be possible if the firmware code generator were completely separated from the patcher interface and driven by an API. SuperCollider has an architecture kind of like this. There is a notion of "sclang" and "scsynth" which are logically separated, client and server respectively. The server isn't aware of what kinds of user interfaces exist, it merely runs the correct DSP code in response to API calls which if I recall correctly are all packaged in Open Sound Control messages. "sclang" the standard client language is just one of many possible clients that can request DSP work on the server; there are bindings for many other languages.</p>

<p>So as a concrete example, given the low level API, you could just plug your Axoloti into a Raspberry Pi or similar and generate code for it from your language of choice via API bindings, say Python for example. There wouldn't be any need for Java or for the full heavyweight patcher app. And then gradually other more lightweight user interfaces could be developed. On the other hand, I think the full patcher implemented correctly could easily run on a Pi, we just have to re-evaluate some of the implementation choices. My gut feeling there is that we'd need to abandon Java completely. I've been impressed with VCV Rack's UI which is based on GLFW but there are other decent choices too. SuperCollider's IDE and UI are all built in Qt, and I'm pretty sure it's viable on a Pi.</p>

              <p>I agree with you <a class="mention" href="/u/urklang">@urklang</a> </p>

<p>I did meet with Johannes at Superbooth (so was a while a go too) and then he was still keen to get this out (and also axoloti control)</p>

<p><strong>but</strong> the experimental branch has a lot of new code, including a re-write of the editor, new chibios (which also meant new midi), new code for axoloti control, and so there are/were a lot of loose ends.</p>

<p>I agree its a bit frustrating, theres so much good stuff in there that would be great to get out there, but now its mixed in with less finished code (afaik). unfortunately, i think the goal for the release was a bit too ambitious, so its been hard to close off - but thats easy to say in hindsight.</p>

<p>also I've not had time to contribute recently, as I've got many other projects on the go,<br>o that has not helped the situation, <br>and honestly these days, I've lost track of what the 'essential' tasks are that need to be done before release - so hard to know how close it is, which makes it hard for me to be motivated to help 'push it over the line'</p>

<p>but as you say, there is no need for panic, the code is all open source, so other variations could be released (*), or developers could help out on the experimental branch to get it finished, and ready for release.</p>

<p>also i will say, while 1.0.12 is not perfect, its very stable ... this was the reason experimental/next release was more ambitious, because it was felt 1.0.12 could bide us some time.<br>however, it was not expected to be this long, and of course I recognise, users like updates, so that it doesn't feel like its stagnating.</p>

<p>anyway, personally i do more development in the winter months, so lets hope we can sort something out during the winter.</p>

<hr>

<p>(*) of course the experimental branch cannot be released, as it has code thats unfinished/buggy, thats why its not released <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  </p>

<p>(*) variations, could cause other organisational issues<br>e.g. if object format changed, then you could not commit these to the axoloti community library, as this needs to be fixed to the officially released version. <br>(however, the library structure already allows for additional library sources, so thats an option)</p>

              <p>Hi guys,</p>

<p>I've been involved in development on and off and am pretty familiar with the codebase. I completely agree about the workflow having some rough edges. There are some obvious things I'd like to do to make it more approachable and user friendly. A big impediment to progress is the tight coupling between the patcher and firmware code generation. A project I plan on doing eventually is to extract the code generator and turn it into a clean API. User interfaces could then be more decoupled, and power users could patch directly against the API. I'd also like to implement live patching; the current code generation / compilation approach isn't ideal for that though, we'll need a more sophisticated mechanism. I've got a few ideas there, it's just a matter of finding the time to implement it.</p>

<p>I haven't been able to get in touch with Johannes for a while so it's unclear what his plan is for future development. There's a bunch of newer code lingering in our experimental branch that I would like to get released. I don't think it's time to panic yet though. If it ends up seeming like development has completely stalled, I'll simply start doing separate releases, possibly under some other name so we can keep things straight in the community. There's no reason we can't have multiple "distributions" that run on the same Axoloti hardware. The hardware leaves us a lot of room for creativity. The code is all available; there's nothing stopping us from continuing development. We do need to make an effort to clean things up in order to get more developers involved though I think.</p>

<p>Best,<br>Nicolas</p>

              <p>Hello Snaper,<br>I'm the guy who answered your question regarding Audio IN/OUT connections a month ago, which was my first post/answer here and I have to admit I was somehow expecting more people to join in and help with the topic.</p>

<p>I did a lot of research and read tons of posts here before buying my Axoloti, and although I found hard to find certain info, I thought that some sort of manual was available.</p>

<p>For my surprise the most valuable assets I found, like the GPIO pins layout and a small Guide for dummies, were all made by Axoloti users.</p>

<p>Don't want to sound picky, since like many say the price is very low and I love it already for what it can do, but somehow a better first steps guide would be great for the "user experience" and to seduce potential buyers... </p>

<p>Originally seems you don't have to be a programmer to make your stuff, like with a Nord Modular, but is not the case... to make relatively simple things there are loads of math modules to be learnt, and modifying people patches is far from basic and self explainatory.</p>

<p>I understand a project like this has very little resources in terms of money and time, but it's a real pity since it's so powerful and versatile...</p>

<p>I try to read around and participate, help every time I can, maybe this way the community grows and more users participate <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>PD has been around for more than 20 years – compare this with Axoloti )<br>and PD does not have dedicated hardware part, which costs money and needs some effort to be obtained. </p>

<p>i strongly suspect people that come from pd / csound / supercollider / etc just don't understand the power of such solution right from the start. it's not that obvious. i myself needed some time to realize that Axoloti is poor man's Kyma (which is very cool), and that Axoloti offers better audio quality (honest 24/48) than concurrent platforms, e.g. Bela, so decided to stick with Axoloti as my primary platform.</p>

<p>but at the end of the day, I tend to just use whatever (platform/software), I feel fits the task at the time, so I don't use Axoloti for everything, but Ive used it in enough places that its value (for me) is beyond doubt.</p>

<p>Again, I wrote, it should be more user friendly...I mean, I'm writing this after years of Max/MSP and my medium successes as encoderaudio <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>i don't want to offend anyone, but. <br>every time i see „ease of use“ talks in context of csound / supercollider / axoloti / etc. —  it resembles me „why James Joyce's books are so hard to read?!“ question <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/sunglasses.png?v=5" title=":sunglasses:" class="emoji" alt=":sunglasses:"> <br>actually, it <strong>is</strong> the easiest platform of this kind. at least, in terms of building patches.</p>

<p><strong>UPD:</strong> but if the topic is called „the future of axoloti“, what i miss in Axoloti ecosystem is some of tools/objects for multiple Axoloti boards interconnection and data exchange, because building synths made of multiple Axolotis is so tempting perspective…</p>
