        <p>Max/MSP is, after all, a commercial sofware, so the vendor obviously can put more effort in improving usability. <br>Axoloti is free in its software part, which is the great avdantage, but on the other hand, we often have to sacrifice something to have that advdntage.</p>

<p>I think all reasonable questions after so long without an update.</p>

<p>yeah, Max is commercial, and also is of course now linked with Ableton, so a bit of investment there too.<br>its probably 'fairer' to compare to Pure Data, which is shall we say 'less pretty' , and has a few bugs/quirks … but even PD has a much wider user base, so much more open source interest.</p>

<p>but at the end of the day, I tend to just use whatever (platform/software), I feel fits the task at the time, so I don't use Axoloti for everything, but Ive used it in enough places that its value (for me) is beyond doubt.</p>

        <p>Hello Snaper,<br>I'm the guy who answered your question regarding Audio IN/OUT connections a month ago, which was my first post/answer here and I have to admit I was somehow expecting more people to join in and help with the topic.</p>

<p>I did a lot of research and read tons of posts here before buying my Axoloti, and although I found hard to find certain info, I thought that some sort of manual was available.</p>

<p>For my surprise the most valuable assets I found, like the GPIO pins layout and a small Guide for dummies, were all made by Axoloti users.</p>

<p>Don't want to sound picky, since like many say the price is very low and I love it already for what it can do, but somehow a better first steps guide would be great for the "user experience" and to seduce potential buyers... </p>

<p>Originally seems you don't have to be a programmer to make your stuff, like with a Nord Modular, but is not the case... to make relatively simple things there are loads of math modules to be learnt, and modifying people patches is far from basic and self explainatory.</p>

<p>I understand a project like this has very little resources in terms of money and time, but it's a real pity since it's so powerful and versatile...</p>

<p>I try to read around and participate, help every time I can, maybe this way the community grows and more users participate <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>Really hope this platform keeps evolving!<br>Thanks to all of the active users!!<br>Cheers</p>

        <p>Hi guys,</p>

<p>I've been involved in development on and off and am pretty familiar with the codebase. I completely agree about the workflow having some rough edges. There are some obvious things I'd like to do to make it more approachable and user friendly. A big impediment to progress is the tight coupling between the patcher and firmware code generation. A project I plan on doing eventually is to extract the code generator and turn it into a clean API. User interfaces could then be more decoupled, and power users could patch directly against the API. I'd also like to implement live patching; the current code generation / compilation approach isn't ideal for that though, we'll need a more sophisticated mechanism. I've got a few ideas there, it's just a matter of finding the time to implement it.</p>

<p>I haven't been able to get in touch with Johannes for a while so it's unclear what his plan is for future development. There's a bunch of newer code lingering in our experimental branch that I would like to get released. I don't think it's time to panic yet though. If it ends up seeming like development has completely stalled, I'll simply start doing separate releases, possibly under some other name so we can keep things straight in the community. There's no reason we can't have multiple "distributions" that run on the same Axoloti hardware. The hardware leaves us a lot of room for creativity. The code is all available; there's nothing stopping us from continuing development. We do need to make an effort to clean things up in order to get more developers involved though I think.</p>

<p>Best,<br>Nicolas</p>

        <p>I agree with you <a class="mention" href="/u/urklang">@urklang</a> </p>

<p>I did meet with Johannes at Superbooth (so was a while a go too) and then he was still keen to get this out (and also axoloti control)</p>

<p><strong>but</strong> the experimental branch has a lot of new code, including a re-write of the editor, new chibios (which also meant new midi), new code for axoloti control, and so there are/were a lot of loose ends.</p>

<p>I agree its a bit frustrating, theres so much good stuff in there that would be great to get out there, but now its mixed in with less finished code (afaik). unfortunately, i think the goal for the release was a bit too ambitious, so its been hard to close off - but thats easy to say in hindsight.</p>

<p>also I've not had time to contribute recently, as I've got many other projects on the go,<br>o that has not helped the situation, <br>and honestly these days, I've lost track of what the 'essential' tasks are that need to be done before release - so hard to know how close it is, which makes it hard for me to be motivated to help 'push it over the line'</p>

<p>but as you say, there is no need for panic, the code is all open source, so other variations could be released (*), or developers could help out on the experimental branch to get it finished, and ready for release.</p>

<p>also i will say, while 1.0.12 is not perfect, its very stable ... this was the reason experimental/next release was more ambitious, because it was felt 1.0.12 could bide us some time.<br>however, it was not expected to be this long, and of course I recognise, users like updates, so that it doesn't feel like its stagnating.</p>

<p>anyway, personally i do more development in the winter months, so lets hope we can sort something out during the winter.</p>

<hr>

<p>(*) of course the experimental branch cannot be released, as it has code thats unfinished/buggy, thats why its not released <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  </p>

<p>(*) variations, could cause other organisational issues<br>e.g. if object format changed, then you could not commit these to the axoloti community library, as this needs to be fixed to the officially released version. <br>(however, the library structure already allows for additional library sources, so thats an option)</p>

        <p>This might be a bit left field, but I have wondered whether it might be possible to for their to be a light weight version of the patcher or something that can do a similar job, that could easily run on the common SBC's we have these days, like raspberry pi's etc.. Such a project could run separately somehow, and be designed without a lot of the bells and whistles the main patcher has.<br>I don't know how something like this could be done, I don't have the skills, but with the plethora of SBC's out their now, this could certainly offer a lot of flexibility for users..<br><img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/grin.png?v=5" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>

        <p>This is exactly the kind of thing that would be possible if the firmware code generator were completely separated from the patcher interface and driven by an API. SuperCollider has an architecture kind of like this. There is a notion of "sclang" and "scsynth" which are logically separated, client and server respectively. The server isn't aware of what kinds of user interfaces exist, it merely runs the correct DSP code in response to API calls which if I recall correctly are all packaged in Open Sound Control messages. "sclang" the standard client language is just one of many possible clients that can request DSP work on the server; there are bindings for many other languages.</p>

<p>So as a concrete example, given the low level API, you could just plug your Axoloti into a Raspberry Pi or similar and generate code for it from your language of choice via API bindings, say Python for example. There wouldn't be any need for Java or for the full heavyweight patcher app. And then gradually other more lightweight user interfaces could be developed. On the other hand, I think the full patcher implemented correctly could easily run on a Pi, we just have to re-evaluate some of the implementation choices. My gut feeling there is that we'd need to abandon Java completely. I've been impressed with VCV Rack's UI which is based on GLFW but there are other decent choices too. SuperCollider's IDE and UI are all built in Qt, and I'm pretty sure it's viable on a Pi.</p>

        <p>Sounds like an interesting longer term plan. <br>Agreed that Rack is pretty impressive as a project. To be clear, though, it can’t run on a Pi and VCV core dev Andrew Belt has explicitly said he won’t target SBCs. (Although, this was a few months ago. Would be surprising if he’s had a change of heart.)</p>

<p>SuperCollider does work on the Pi and scsynth is used by Sonic Pi, which is included in the base Raspbian and Ubuntu MATE distros.</p>

        <p>Rack is cool, but it is a CPU hog. IMO there is put way to much weight on the UI side. It looks really sweet, but that infinite size scaling, among other things is very cpu draining. My fan is blowing full speed alost from the second I open rack. </p>

<p>I prefer something like Axoloti then, where all that UI stuff, which IMO is secondary in a musical applications, is toned down, focus is on the audio processing.</p>

        <p>I agree with you guys that Rack is pretty heavyweight. Someone attempted to get a build going on Raspian/similar despite Andrew's position: <a href="https://github.com/mi-rack/Rack" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/mi-rack/Rack</a>. I tried to build it a few weeks ago, ran into a snag, gave up and tried to ping the dev. Haven't heard back so it may be a dead project.</p>

<p>It might be unrealistic to actually do all that DSP without specific optimization for ARM which will be tough without having Andrew on board. The raw GLFW UI tech itself is cool though and would probably be useful on SBCs in a more minimal form. Philosophically the "skeumorphic" design idea of having everything look like Eurorack isn't my favorite thing. There's no user abstraction mechanism at all; you're just stuck with the finished modules. But that makes it way more approachable to people who know Eurorack and don't care about any sort of "programming language"-like functionality.</p>

<p>well, one very distinct specialty of axolotls is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axolotl#Neoteny" rel="nofollow noopener">neoteny</a>. this means that axolotls often stay in larval stage forever, and even reproduce. </p>

<p>so things just happen like the name suggests.</p>

        <p>Andrew is super protective over VCV.... EVEN the stuff he has no rights over. He once got mad a me cause I made a copy of the filter he made for vcv..... Which he didnt even write himself, he copied it from somewhere else..... That's just too much. </p>

<p>So I am not surprised that he opposes making a Pi release. Maybe he should not have made it open source then, if he wants that amount of control. It just doesn't go hand in hand with open source, imo.</p>

        <p>My first post, but after discovering Axoloti last week while searching for something else, I’ve got two on the way...</p>

<p>STM makes much about software and hardware compatibility- I wonder if we’ll be seeing F7 Axoloti?</p>

        <p>A port to other STM devices or even other MCU platforms entirely is definitely possible. My feeling is that the DSP code itself would be reasonably portable to other ARM devices that support the CMSIS DSP library. Chibios, the realtime os Axoloti uses, supports many other devices, so in theory much of the Chibios code could be reused.</p>

<p>I think the basic approach of having the patcher generate firmware source which is then compiled could be improved upon. That approach is very tied to the particular hardware target we have right now. The patcher is very coupled to hardware and the toolchain for that hardware. In the future, I'd like to do something that is more like a proper API, i.e. future hardware targets expose a common API and various clients (one of which would be the visual patcher) could make calls to it. Supercollider's architecure is like this (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider#Architecture" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider#Architecture</a>), there is a clear distinction between the low-level synthesis server and the high-level client language.</p>

        <p>What you describe definitely requires a large effort.</p>

<p>Upgrading to the F7 chip might require very little effort, if STM claims of compatibility are true.</p>

Me personally and i'm sure quite a lot of the owners leaning more to the "user" side would happily spend some extra money for improved software, given how affordable everything is in the first place. Someone could come up with a guesstimate goal/money list?</p>

<p>obviously this won't come up with a proper developer salary for the thousands of hours probably needed for this but it might help a bit?</p>
