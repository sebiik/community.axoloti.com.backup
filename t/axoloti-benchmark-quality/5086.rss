    <title>Axoloti benchmark quality</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/axoloti-benchmark-quality/5086</link>
    <description>Hello everyone,

Very nice to meet you. I just heard of the pixaloti. Browsing a bit and wondering if there is a axoloti effect/synth patch library somewhere?
One with categories, descriptions etc. and full of patches downloadable for use with the paxoloti.
It would be nice to get a jump start into this journey.
the journey of the ixalotti.

Sincerely,

Ronny</description>

              <p>This is very helpful. Thank you. I think i'm going to start with a Axoloti. Just the bare board. Get into the patches and try to find some nice combo's.<br>Run some synths through it and see what it's got <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>I like the idea of chaining some patches and building something that is exactly what i want. <br>Nice one.</p>

<p>Thank you very much Technobear. This is very helpful.</p>

              <p>i don't know if the wanderlust comes with patches that make it work out of the box (and how good/useful they are to you), or if your expected to still mainly create your own patches.<br>if its the later, then id say it 'ups the ante' - you have to be sure its for you, and have the time/inclination to make the most of it.</p>

<p>my <strong>personal</strong> opinion (and this is no disrespect to the wanderlust as ive never seen/heard it) is if the wanderlust appeals, id be tempted to get a bare axoloti, and play with it a bit - see if Axoloti is for you.<br>THEN if it is buy the wanderlust , you'll see many have more than 1 axoloti, so having a spare is not a bad thing <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Wizard/Owl, <br>thats a tricky one as never seen/heard one (they are very new) <br>I like RebelTech, Ive got a Bela Salt which they did in collaboration with Bela.io<br>there range is definitely a cool concept, it fits nicely somewhere between a DIY product and a 'finished' product.</p>

<p>my impression with OWL in the past is that its great because its easily accessible via PureData/Faust, <br>but its not that powerful  i.e. unlike axoloti where you'll see it running a poly synth into a reverb, with a bit of chorus, <br>OWL , tends to have single function patches  .  a reverb, or a chorus , or a synth - and they tend not to be that involved.<br>but I dont know, if thats just the patches , or caused by hardware limitations.</p>

<p>so cant really say, does it hit a sweet spot of complexity/simplicity , or is it a bit limited?</p>

<p>there are other options you can look at too.</p>

<p>Organelle - Im a real fan of this, again you can program it yourself, but there are also loads of patches - its got a great community behind it too (and I contribute to it  too - both on the 'firmware' size, and also I wrote Orac <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> )</p>

<p>ModDevices (moddevices.com) , this is more in someways similar to rebeltech/owl, but has a few more 'commercial patches' available for it. (more expensive too <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ) </p>

<p> see it this all as  a continuum </p>

<p>DIY ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt; 'out of the box' product<br>raspberryPi -&gt; axoloti -&gt; wanderlust -&gt; owl -&gt; organelle / mod devices -&gt; H9</p>

<p>this is not accurate, but hopefully you get the idea... you'll also see that price point, also broadly follows this.</p>

<p>whats also important to note, is most of this <strong>can</strong> sound as good as the others (there are some technical limitations)  , its more down to time/effort of the owner, and how much they want to play with it.</p>

<hr>

<p>so, again, it comes back to what do you want...</p>

<p>Eventide are well respected effects developers, they know what they are doing , so the price of the pedal is not just the hardware but your also paying for that expertise, and their time to develops these effects.</p>

<p>when your buying 'community developed' effects pedal, your not paying for development of the effects/algos. <br>your relying on what the community has developed, and their expertise, and they do what <strong>they</strong> want, so does it match what <strong>you</strong> want</p>

<p>thats not to say, its not as good, for sure it can be, but theres no guarantees and it can be a 'mixed bag'.<br>so you might find a few FX patches, that make it wow, this is fantastic, or you might just not find what you want / need.<br>(that the advantage of being able to patch them yourself, you can make what you want if it doesnt exist) </p>

<p>(note: this is no disrespect to community patches, saying they are better/worst ... as I release stuff to the community too, so my comments are fully inclusive of my efforts <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> )</p>

              <p>always when thinking about any product, we should take into account price, <br>comparing a 500 euro pedal (H9) with a 65 euro axoloti -  is never going to be a reasonable comparison!</p>

<p>but...</p>

<p>hardware wise Axoloti uses a good quality DAC, and is running at 48khz SR, and a low buffer size and has decent 1/4" TRS jacks - so the hardware does not (for me) disappoint.</p>

<p>patches</p>

<p>are they any good effects out there?<br>for sure theres quite a few good community objects/patches <br>and also (disclaimer my objects, so biased) there are the mutable clouds, elements and rings objects which I have permanently running   on one of my axoloti <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>( I will admit there aren't that many musical demos out there of axoloti, so its tough to know - but a search on youtube will find some good ones - though they may not show exactly what you after ... axoloti can do some much, people use it in so many different ways) </p>

<p>but this is the real difference between a product like a Shruthi/H9 and axoloti.</p>

<p>an H9 you cannot extend and do what you like, and you have paid for Eventide to develop all the algorithms.<br>axoloti whilst it has lots of things (generously) shared by the community, it real strength is you can also build/adapt your own.</p>

<p>let me give a simple example.<br>if you buy an effects pedal , say a delay, and it has just a time control and mix knob - thats it your done<br>with axoloti, if you have a delay patch, and you want to add an LFO to the time control , you can do that.</p>

<p>what this means in practice is.<br>something like the H9/Shruthi has to have all the possible controls that the designers think their customer needs.</p>

<p>whereas with axoloti its the opposite,  you can find a minimal patch and then add what <strong>you</strong> need.</p>

<p>this is a very different way of working, and may not be for everyone.</p>

<hr>

<p>so really your comparing apples n oranges, <br>not only in price point, (H9 is nearly 10x cost of the axoloti!) , but also approach, and goals.</p>

<p>if you want plug in and just go, then the H9 is probably what your after.</p>

<p>if you want to have something a bit more flexible, something you can adapt, and tune and are wiling to invest some time learning then axoloti is cool.</p>

<p>they are so different, its completely valid to get both , esp. since axoloti is not expensive for what it is, and has so many possibilities for use.</p>
