    <title>8channel surround pre processor/enhancer unit</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/8channel-surround-pre-processor-enhancer-unit/4857</link>
    <description>what:
so, for the amount of surround patches i have, i have enough algorythms for multiple audio setups, controlled by a nice touchscreen and/or universal IR remote

--------------------------------------------------
why:
because i dislike ALL consumer devices for being closed source and having those closed standards regarding audio processing algorythms.
most have lots of internal amplifiers as well, usually more than the user needs, aka more idle power draw than needed.
and to break away from those &quot;high end&quot; sound formats, which 99.9% of people fall to, like &quot;quality 5x as high as CD&quot;, most people don&#39;t even notice differences above 320k MP3 files.

--------------------------------------------------
goals:
i&#39;m doing this not even for myself to be honest.
i want to give the world of home theatre lovers (and DIY people) a configurable, open source software alternative to closed source things.
because open source matters alot to me.

--------------------------------------------------
why not fully open source?
the reason the hardware is only going to be partially open sourced:
because the axoloti is closed source (which is ok to me from johannes&#39; standpoint being &quot;preventing chinese ripoffs&quot;).
all other hardware can be found online, and require either some assembly and soldering, or extra money to let someone do that for you.

--------------------------------------------------
what exact hardware:
teensy 3.2 with TDM audio board
ILI9341C 2.8&quot; resistive screen (adafruit)
4 axoloti core boards (v1.2)
some IO wires and shielded audio cables
a enclosure to your liking.
--------------------------------------------------
sound goals:
48khz, 16bit sound (cd quality, as most people won&#39;t even notice higher standards at all)


the sound modes i plan on:

- 7.1 surround decorder (input select: usb stereo, stereo1, stereo2, stereo3, 5.1)
 - (param) imaging width
 - (param) lowpass crossover subwoofer

- 5.1 surround decoder with 2 ceiling speakers (input select: usb stereo, stereo1, stereo2, stereo3, 5.1)
 - (param) imaging width
 - (param) ceiling crossover
 - (param) top sound spreading
 - (param) lowpass crossover subwoofer

- quad stereo setup (input select: usb stereo, stereo1, stereo2, stereo3)

- triple stereo with 2 subwoofers (input select: usb stereo, stereo1, stereo2, stereo3)
 - (param) highpass crossover subwoofer

- generic params:
 - (param) per channel volume
 - (param) per channel highpass
--------------------------------------------------
control mcu details:

for interface control i plan on using a Teensy 3.2 with a TDM chip, which can have 6ch in, 8 ch out

the parameter controlling will happen in the teensy 3.2, and put out to the axoloti modules using ditital IO pins

the user configuration won&#39;t be lost upon power off, as i plan on using the teensy&#39;s EEPROM to store the data.

aside from the IR remote, a touchscreen will be used most likely, as well as some buttons to manage the unit

--------------------------------------------------
dsp module details:

each dsp (axoloti) runs it&#39;s own unique patch, and some audio input switches based upon the digital IO pins.

--------------------------------------------------
estimated costs:
i assume this project won&#39;t be cheap overall, so a long term budget of 1000$ will be doable.

--------------------------------------------------
estimated time to finsih:
i hope to have this one finished before the end of 2019</description>
