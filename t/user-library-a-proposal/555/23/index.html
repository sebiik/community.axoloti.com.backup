<blockquote><p>the hope is to 'hide' git away as much as possible for day to day use,</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>users will NOT see github, the Axoloti GUI will automatically be syncing and submitting things, most users will just continue to use the axoloti UI as they do today, with a couple more options:<br>as far as the user sees it, they will just say:<br>- share this new patch/axo etc<br>- upload changes patches/axo to library<br>- sync contribution library , at which point they will see new objects in the object search window.</p>

<p>no mention of git etc... <br>(only thing collaborators will have to do is signup to git, non-collaborators/normal users wont need to do this)</p>

<p>my point above about advanced operations, is I'm not going to start implementing things like delete, rename, seeing version histories etc. as most users don't need... so therefore 'for admin' purposes we can merely use github directly. <br>(but these operations are reasonably rare, and could be done my maintainers who know how to use git)</p>

<p>I thought I was pretty clear in my closing paragraph, <br>I don't think this is a perfect solution, more a practical one which I probably have enough time to implement, and perhaps a starting point.<br>Of course, Im sure we would all like a pretty web interface, with integration into the UI, searching, tagging....  and if you have the time/skills to implement it thats fantastic news for us all.</p>

<p>anyway, if its not what people want thats fine by me too... hence why I proposed it, rather than started implementing it.</p>

        <p>One thought:</p>

<p>Why make it so complicated? It is a file archieve system, which you can find 1000s and 1000s of on the internet all ready... It is not something that really need to be reinvented. Isnt it like reinventing the wheel?</p>

<p>There are as mentioned above loads of great patch archive system all ready, like Reaktor library, Electro-music.com patch library. Why ot just take inspiration from them? <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

        <p>Git is a file archive, that is already being used by everyone here. I actually like Technobears approach quite a bit. (and Im glad you necroed the thread). Having it be part of the default patcher UI is pretty brilliant in that for most folks its just another menu called "library" that then reads from GIT. The Reaktor library is pretty slick (user voting, , but it would require pretty constant maintenance and a fair amount of front end web work, the elctro-music nord patch library is a bit of a mess though and I wouldn't use that as a good example.</p>

<p>For organization I would 100% go the tagging route (which GIT supports). The directory structure on the back end doesn't matter as much as long as the front end UI uses the Tags to organize stuff. You can have a preset set of tags (these are stolen straight from the Reaktor library) The bold ones are their categories the rest are tags.</p>

<p>I am not tied to GIT but it has a lot of the usable functionality for something like this built in. <a class="mention" href="/users/thetechnobear">@thetechnobear</a> have you done anymore work or thinking about this in the last few months?</p>

<p>Does that mean you have to download all content of Git Axoloti library or you only download the list of objects and the you can select which patches you want to download from within Axoloti editor?</p>

<p>This is an issue we cannot go around. Since many people use custom objects in there patches, this will always be an issue, especially when working with open source programs like Axoloti. Everyone is making their own versions of the objects. There are all ready loads of them in the community. It must be the uploader task to make sure that the patches uploaded also includes custom objects for that patch. We just need to have faith in each other <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> If patches are not updated, after a friendly reminder or two, they should be deleted.</p>

<blockquote><ol><li>samples (and other 'media') we cannot have large samples included (size limit?) , it will just take too long for an end user to synchronise, and we have to remember they may be completely uninterested in your samples/demo!no copyrighted material can be uploaded ... including anything from commercial sound libraries.(fortunately, uploads contain username uploading... so enforcement will come after you <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> )I was thinking we would 'outlaw' samples, and only allow axo/axp/axh/axs BUT this would mean many demos just would not work/be usefulthoughts?</li></ol></blockquote></aside>

<p>I think outlawing samples is not so good idea. But I also understand why it is a good idea. It would take up a lot of Github space. But I think the idea of a patch library kind of looses its weight, if you cannot upload everything like samples, custom objects along with the patches. If you have to link to another place, why not just put the patch there too? It is going to be too confusing shifting between pages to get samples/patches,/etc. Better to have all collected in one place.</p>

<p>I have many patches that are "specialized" for one specific sample. And I think most patches using samples are specialized cause of how the tables work. You cannot make patches that work well with all samples, a patch is usually dedicated to one specific sample to do one specific thing(I know you can make patches that work with hall samples, but take in mind table/alloc table size and other variables in patches). Also if you build a patch around one sample it would be weird not sharing the sample along with the patch. That way people might not understand what the patch is actually about.</p>

<p>But I think a lot of your proposals are good and some of the questions you have raised are very valid. And thanks for taking the time to do it <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> I have no programming skills, so cannot contribute in development, but I will be happy to contribute to the patch library when it is "released".</p>

<p>I am thinking cant the "open URL" feature of Axoloti be used in this context? If you are browsing Git and find the patch you like, you copy the URL to Axoloti and paste it and open the patch like that? That is pretty simple. But yeah that might cause problems if custom objects and samples are included in the patches.</p>

        <p>No, Ive not done anything more... since there was no consensus, which meant I couldn't just start adding code into the main axoloti code base.... </p>

<p>its a shame, because as i clearly stated, my belief is the existence of a shared library is <strong>much</strong> more important to Axoloti, than if its a good implementation or not. (let alone a perfect one).<br>but the discussions here and elsewhere,  did not seem to agree with this... so here we are nearly 3 months later with no progress.</p>

<p>Git was only one solution on how to do it quickly, I thought I made that really clear in the opening paragraph of the post.</p>

<p>similarly in the closing paragraph i stated:<br></p>

<blockquote><p>one parting thought, I know there are better ways to do some of the above (e.g. packaging demos) BUT can I please ask - we keep 'expectations' in check. i.e. lets not have suggestions where its expected someone else has to develop it. this is aimed as a starting point, with relatively little dev effort required not necessarily the end game <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p></blockquote></aside>

<p>frankly if we want to do this really well, its many man weeks of development.... and Ive not seen anyone willing to take this on as yet.</p>

<p>so i ended up feeling, perhaps I was the only one that felt this, and was perhaps just being too eager to get to the next stage, a place where 'newbies' could pick up axoloti and 'just use' - and thats cool by me, it was only a proposal</p>

        <p>And that is also why I change my mind about it. Since I cant contribute with coding, I will support your idea, cause it seems like you put a lot of thought into it <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> Just had to read it a few times. </p>

<p>Anyway, yeah, I also think it is a shame, cause it would make Axoloti more easy to approach for modular "beginners" <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>It was a very good proposal, and your goals are very strong. Once I have gotten more comfortable with the whole environment I would certainly be interested in looking at this.</p>

        <p>Yes. A shared library is the best feature we can have to continue growing our Axoloti community.<br>But if everybody have an opinion we will never end this discussion. Let's do it!!</p>

        <p>I apologize for leaving this tread open for too long. Many things required my full attention during the past months that appeared more urgent to me, with the idea that a user object/patch library needs deep and careful planning. </p>

<p>OK, let's give it a go! I created <a href="https://github.com/axoloti/axoloti-contrib">https://github.com/axoloti/axoloti-contrib</a><br>PM me (with your github username) if you want to be added as a collaborator.</p>

<p>I have one question: will users be able to push commits to the repo from within the GUI, and how is login handled? But even without, a GUI like github's own application makes it fairly accessible.</p>

        <p>It seems like a good possible solution to this problem would be to provide a fully fledged package (patch?) management utility within the axoloti patcher, one which can point to one or many repositories such as the proposed axoloti-contrib repo.</p>

<p>This approach absolves several of the current concerns regarding file-size restrictions for patches and patches containing samples (to prevent user from downloading a huge mass of data from the repo unnecessarily) because this approach would allow for the end user to browse for packages (whatever you want to call it) and install in an ad-hoc fashion, or even en-mass.</p>

<p>A formalized package manager would also allow ample room for seemingly transparent repo-integration. One such way would be to always download a manifest of all contrib packages upon patcher startup (think apt-cache, if you're familiar with debian), and this way a user could see contrib patches in the patch-insertion menu (when you press space in the patcher), but the ones that need to be downloaded are grayed out or have some visual indication that they need to be downloaded/updated upon insertion. Also, there could be dependency resolution and version history (for patches which use an older external package version). A dependency/version resolution also solves another concern you had in regards to broken patches. if all patches were being maintained, it would make keeping patches operable a fucking nightmare because everything would be breaking all the time...</p>

<p>However, to implement this kind of thing, we may need to seriously reconsider the file representation of an axoloti patch. Now, I am speaking without having really opened up a patch, but I believe axoloti patches/subpatches themselves should be something like an archive, with a manifest file (which has references to external contrib patches with versions) and then patch-specific files, sub-patches, documentation, etc. stored within it.</p>

<p>This may not be a feasible approach, but I'm sure there are package management libraries we could leverage from the open-source community to aid in this effort.</p>

        <p>Johannes has been doing some work in packaging area, and I in the user library for a future release.<br>it might not be as feature rich as you outline (I'm familiar with package management system), but I hope will act as a 'stepping stone'.<br>BUT more importantly it will provide users with a functioning system, which will make sharing much easier and organised than it is today. I really hope this will encourage the creation of even more content for sharing in the axoloti community.</p>

        <p>Great</p>

<p>I was over on Github a few times looking for patches. but gave up.. and also gave up uploading anyting to it because it is too complicated. Since Johanne made the repository not one patch have been uploaded. Must people still do it here.</p>
