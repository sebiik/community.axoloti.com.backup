    <title>Combining the delay/read interp and delay/write sdram!</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/combining-the-delay-read-interp-and-delay-write-sdram/3051</link>
    <description>Hello :) 

I have been experimenting with making a delay object, where I would like to combine the delay/read interp with the delay/write sdram. I managed to do it in 2 different ways, the patch goes live and it works... BUT........ The sound that comes out of the object sounds really bad. Sounds a bit the same way as if you feed an interpeted signal into a non interpeted table. Doesnt sound nice. So I am thinking it might be related to the interpetation going on. One object is interpeted(delay/read interp) and the other(delay/write sdram) is not interpeted..... and when combined it doesnt work well.

Would anyone know a solution for this issue? How to make the interpetation internally in the object?

Thanks!

Here is a patch with a couple of test versions:

@SirSickSik
In your repeater object I see you use the same approach with the delay/read X and the delay/write in the same object. I am wondering if you are using the non interp or the interp version on the delay? I cant figure that out. Thanks</description>

<p>note though, that when shifting &lt;&lt;2, the largest two bits will be "lost" and the smallest two bits will be zero. When shifting the other way 3, the smallest three bits will be "lost" and the biggest three bits will be zero. This comes in useful every once in a while.</p>

<p>Thanks man. Well I am basically building a delay that I have all ready as a subpatch so I have something to compare to as I go along. And after I fixed the buffer issue it sounded as it was supposed to. So I am not sure there is anything to fix there. Still need to learn more about this bitshifting.</p>

<p>YES this was it. I removed the buffer part from the code and now it works. Thanks</p>

<p>Yes the first version on the picture I have removed the attr_delayname and call the name with writepos directly in the object... <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>
