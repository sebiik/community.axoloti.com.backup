    <description>Hi,
this topic to express my enthusiasm for this one man project.
I was looking for a way to control my next axoloti project with a lot of controls. I wanted them to be nrpn resolution since I am quite hooked to the resolution of analog inputs on axo. And although I have done multiplexing directly on axo (with the help of great objects from great coders on the forum) this time I wanted to safe my axo resources for actual synthesis stuff... (as a side not I must say muxing does not take that much of resources but still...)

Not being a coder myself I was looking for a &#39;user friendly&#39; way. I stumbled on this project that looked very promising:

https://github.com/paradajz/OpenDeck
Have a look at the features and you&#39;ll see what I mean:
https://github.com/paradajz/OpenDeck/wiki/Configurable-features
The settings are made via a WebInterface:
https://shanteacontrols.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/new_webui_01.png

I ran a short test with 2x 4051 multiplexer (and @DrJustice &#39;s object drj/midi/nrpn_rx_f) on a Blackpill STM32F11CE (damn cheap) and it is running great. I was up and running in an hour (apart from the hours working myself into github, flashing etc... I am totally new to arduino-alike stuff...)
I ordered a bunch of 4067&#39;s and would like to run a test with 4 of them, hoping not to run into trouble traffic wise...)
If all goes well I&#39;ll end up with a 64pot nprn controller...

Anyway, thumbs up for this guys project!</description>

<p>Couldn't agree with you more. My original concept was too grandiose, even after getting everything to fit, so I scaled it down to something more manageable, and now it's more exciting than ever. </p>

<p>Can't wait to see what you have in store.</p>

              <p>Whoa that thing is really cool, bookmarked.</p>

<p>Quick recommendation if you haven't already: Build your patch with all of the required connections in place (including mod sources, CC assignments, etc.) before you have your entire setup ready to go. This is just to check and see if there's enough SRAM. I'm using an external MIDI controller for the Axo and learned the hard way as I was getting all of my CC's set up.</p>
