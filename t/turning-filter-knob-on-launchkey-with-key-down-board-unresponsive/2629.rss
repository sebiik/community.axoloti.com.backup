    <title>Turning filter knob on Launchkey with key down = board unresponsive</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/turning-filter-knob-on-launchkey-with-key-down-board-unresponsive/2629</link>
    <description>Hey there, I created the lead synth based on something in the  &#39;Getting started with Axoloti&#39; book. 

Very exciting... so I connect the Noveation Launch key, and it mostly works... Thing is, if I keep a key down while opening or closing the filter, it appears to becomes unusable...

If I turn the knob with the key down... I just get what ever tone was playing continuously, and I have disconnect the power supply from the axoloti to get it to stop...

At first I thought this was a hardware issue, but while writing this, I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s a problem with the patch....

Here&#39;s the patch (let me know if it&#39;s not cool to post patches from the book here

What do you think?</description>

<p>rather than use the CC modulation that your using, use midi/in/cc and connect it to the pitch inlet on the vcf3</p>

<p>what Im trying to determine, if its just any midi is causing an issue , or something related to the way the modulation sources work.</p>

<p>I suspect its an issue with the launch key, as your patch is working fine with my midi controller..</p>

<p>the other thing you could do which will prove this, is if you plug the launch pad into the computer (rather than axoloti) and then forward the launchpad midi on the computer to the axoloti, I suspect it will work fine.</p>

<p>I'm afraid I don't have another controller with knobs at the moment.</p>

<p>Cool, thanks for the tip, I've attached my patch...</p>

<p>I have replicated with a Math/*c control (so not just the filter) on a different knob, but I guess all the knobs (there are 8 along the top of the launch key) are pretty much the same.</p>

<p>If I change it in the ui with a midi-keyboard key pressed down, it works well...</p>

<p>If I keep the midi key pressed down, then turn the knob, I can see that the filter control on the ui doesn't move (as it was before without the key pressed down). It stays where it is.</p>

<p>Upon further testing I figured out that if you move the knob slowly there is no problem, it's only when moving the knob quickly that it freezes like this.</p>

<p>After this has happened, I untick the live button, then click it again - no response, only silence. Then I restart the axoloti software - same result. It's only when I disconnect and then re-connect the midi-controller from the board, that I get a response again. </p>

<p>After this I found that I don't need to restart the software at all, it's simply a disconnect, and re-connection of the midi controller along with an untick and retick of the live box, that gets it working again.</p>

<p>theres nothing wrong with that patch, as posted, and really patches should not generally be able to 'crash' the board (though its not possible <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">) </p>

<p>I seem to remember <a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> has fixed something since 1.0.11 (so will be in 1.0.12) that caused some instability when initially going live, and the board disconnects - its not something Ive encountered, but seen some reports here.</p>
