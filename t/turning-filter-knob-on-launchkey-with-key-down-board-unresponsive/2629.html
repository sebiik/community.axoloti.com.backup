        <p>what do you mean by 'unusable' or crashes... does the board disconnect?<br>you need to be more specific, post a copy of the text from the console if there is an error....</p>

<p>theres nothing wrong with that patch, as posted, and really patches should not generally be able to 'crash' the board (though its not possible <img src="http://community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">) </p>

<p>I seem to remember <a class="mention" href="../../users/johannes.html">@johannes</a> has fixed something since 1.0.11 (so will be in 1.0.12) that caused some instability when initially going live, and the board disconnects - its not something Ive encountered, but seen some reports here.</p>

        <p>so, for example you cant change the dials in the UI?</p>

<p>also is it just the CC you have mapped to the VCF, or any CC you send?<br>also if you try a demo patch, and add a CC modulation to one of the parameters to that, does it work ok?</p>

<p>also try the patch a different way, rather than use modulation CC, try using a filter with a modulation input, and then feed in midi/in/cc</p>

<p>do you have another midi controller you can try? does it work as expected?</p>

<p>basically we need to isolate if its a bug in the midi handling, and if its specific to the launchkey, or in the midi moduation code... </p>

<p>also, its a good idea to attach your patch when you have an issue, others are more likely to try it, then rather than try to recreate from a screenshot.</p>

        <blockquote><p>so, for example you cant change the dials in the UI?</p></blockquote>

<p>If I change it in the ui with a midi-keyboard key pressed down, it works well...</p>

<p>If I keep the midi key pressed down, then turn the knob, I can see that the filter control on the ui doesn't move (as it was before without the key pressed down). It stays where it is.</p>

<p>Upon further testing I figured out that if you move the knob slowly there is no problem, it's only when moving the knob quickly that it freezes like this.</p>

<p>After this has happened, I untick the live button, then click it again - no response, only silence. Then I restart the axoloti software - same result. It's only when I disconnect and then re-connect the midi-controller from the board, that I get a response again. </p>

<p>After this I found that I don't need to restart the software at all, it's simply a disconnect, and re-connection of the midi controller along with an untick and retick of the live box, that gets it working again.</p>

<p>I have replicated with a Math/*c control (so not just the filter) on a different knob, but I guess all the knobs (there are 8 along the top of the launch key) are pretty much the same.</p>

<p>I'm afraid I don't have another controller with knobs at the moment.</p>

<p>rather than use the CC modulation that your using, use midi/in/cc and connect it to the pitch inlet on the vcf3</p>

<p>what Im trying to determine, if its just any midi is causing an issue , or something related to the way the modulation sources work.</p>

<p>I suspect its an issue with the launch key, as your patch is working fine with my midi controller..</p>

<p>the other thing you could do which will prove this, is if you plug the launch pad into the computer (rather than axoloti) and then forward the launchpad midi on the computer to the axoloti, I suspect it will work fine.</p>
