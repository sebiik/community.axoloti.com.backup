    <title>Clock Midi Thru?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/clock-midi-thru/5824</link>
    <description>Hey dear Axoloti community!
I&#39;m pretty new to this whole thing, so far I did a lot of things in max/msp, and really liking the axoloti concept so far.
My first project is gonna be an effects box for my live set that should have one crucial extra task:
it should receive the midi clock via din and output it to my sq1 sequencer, that sadly has only usb midi in, and since I play hardware only a usb midi host is the only solution.
I&#39;ve read around a bit, and it seems axoloti kind of has difficulties working with midi real time messages.
I&#39;ve tried the a773/midithru_incl_clock object, and it transmits notes just fine, but not the clock.
Is there anything I&#39;m overlooking? In the community library it says: &quot;note: does not handle sysex or clock&quot;, but the name says incl. clock, also some other forum members wrote that it can transmit midi clock messages.
Any help would greatly be appreciated!

best, j</description>

              <p>don't delete it that is good reference, and it is like this on a few hardware synths! waldorf blofeld for example has the same scheme for clock input.</p>

              <p>Don't know hoe to delete my post, so I guess I'll close it myself.<br>Feeling a little bit stupid, the issue was, somehow the SQ1 hast 2 midi In ports, one is for the clock only, so setting the output to usb host port 2 worked fine.</p>
