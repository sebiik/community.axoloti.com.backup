    <title>Not Getting Enough Volume</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/not-getting-enough-volume/4622</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, 
Based on reading a lot of your answers, I know this question is simple. But I just don&#39;t know enough to solve it myself. 

I have two axoloti cores, each with fairly simple patches, connected to breadboards to allow for button controls (and LEDs because who doesn&#39;t like lights). 

When I plugged the axoloti core&#39;s output directly into a PA speaker, it was super quiet. 
I&#39;ve used the math/*c on everything, and for audio effects I&#39;ve used inconfig. But I can&#39;t get very much volume at all out of the speaker. 

When I used it through my guitar amp, I didn&#39;t have the same problems.  I&#39;m just wondering if anyone has any idea why and what I could do? 

Thanks!</description>

              <p>Active speakers will be line level, while guitar amps usually are "instrument level" (matching the much lower more microphone-like levels of traditional passive pickups). Digital devices, the Axoloti included, are generally Vpp limited, while analogue gear (even more so electrical guitars) are current constrained, so the two worlds do not really match up in terms of loudness. Depending on the patch, the Axoloti might both be too quiet to get an adequate volume out of the active speaker, or be loud enough to  blow a fuse (or even a speaker membrane), so it is advisable (and recommended in the FAQ) to use a mixer to correct volumes, and start with a low volume on new patches...</p>

              <p>I'm sorry I don't even know. It is a powered speaker. Im now trying it through an audio interface using a max patch but still not getting enough volume</p>
