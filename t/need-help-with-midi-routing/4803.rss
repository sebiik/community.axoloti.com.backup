    <title>Need help with MIDI routing</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/need-help-with-midi-routing/4803</link>
    <description>Hey there

I just got a few days ago an Axoloti from a friend. One of my aims is to do some simple MIDI routing, so I don&#39;t have to spend money on something more expensive. I tried a few hours to get where I want, but honestly I can&#39;t make it work. At least, that&#39;s not unexpected ;)

Here&#39;s what I want to do:

- route the MIDI channels 1-8 of the USB host to the MIDI channels 1-8 of the USB port

- route MIDI channel 12 of the USB host to MIDI channel 1 of the DIN out

- route MIDI channel 13 of the USB host to MIDI channel 13 of the DIN out

- route MIDI channel 14 of the USB host to MIDI channels 14, 15 and 16 of the DIN out. This one should be polyphonic.

Btw I&#39;m not familiar with the programing environment used to create objects, Does anybody have some advice?

Have a nive day</description>

              <p>The midi outputs are easy, as they have selector for channel and device, so you simply just set the midi out object to the right channel and device port.</p>

<p>For the midi inputs, they don't have a midi channel and device selector, so you have to do something else here. You could make a subpatch, set to a dedicated midi channel and midi port. like this and then connect it to the midi output</p>
