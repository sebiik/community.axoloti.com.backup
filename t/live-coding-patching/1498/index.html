        <p>Note: this is a 'pie in the sky' topic, just a discussion... <br>(i.e. dont get your hopes up on it being implemented <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> ) </p>

<p>Ive been recently playing with Extempore <a href="http://extempore.moso.com.au">(http://extempore.moso.com.au</a>), and quite like what it has to offer, and wondered how something similar might be possible be offered on the axoloti core board, <br>and direction we might go to add some of its ideas to axoloti.</p>

<p>(you could argue, SonicPi and many others offer similar... though many of these rely on Supercollider) </p>

<p>so there are two parts that interest me:</p>

<ul>
<li>hot swapping code</li>
<li>other "user" interfaces </li>
</ul>

<p>(maybe later I'll split these into two separate topics, if there is interest in discussing both)</p>

<p><strong>hot swapping code</strong><br>the most obvious here, is to do like (apparently) the nord modular... and allow patches to be edited live, substituting in new patches on the fly.<br>of course, many issues in doing this, to ensure audio is uninterrupted.</p>

<p>Im kind of interested in, how would this be done (approximately, I know its complicated)<br>what granularity is used?  e.g. you could imagine, and entire patch being substituted or individual objects.<br>the later seems problematic, since you cannot optimise the whole code if you do this, only down to object level, and the STM32 probably needs this optimisation. <br>how do you keep state?  a particular problem if you do an entire code swap....</p>

<p>does something like MCJIT with LLVM handle any of these issues?</p>

<p>is this all or nothing?<br>e.g. I was thinking of an application, where actually most of the patch is pretty static, but I should like to alter some some elements (e.g. say some calculations) ... something that requires a bit more than just changing values, e.g. introducing new calculations, but does not require changing the call hierarchy. </p>

<p>(random thinking: like changing a pointer to function... I just need to introduce a new function... hmm, Im thinking perhaps this is possible in a similar way to the way a patch currently works. having a special 'upload' section, and then being careful about how I switch between code i.e. you flip between an active code, and uploaded code, at a safe point e.g. next k-rate run.)</p>

<p><strong>other user interfaces</strong><br>initially, I was thinking about GUI vs languages (these lisp ones are quite nice).<br>this are interesting, for different use-cases to a graphical environment...</p>

<p>this one is easier to imagine applying to axoloti, and has previously been discussed a bit in <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/dsl-alternative-to-gui-patcher/1326">this thread</a> , the 'obvious' solution is to create a patch file, and compile it... and some clever programming/language bindings could even expose axoloti objects.</p>

<p>I also wondered about the 'nature' of the interaction between axoloti and a 'client computer'.<br>e.g. imagine axoloti hardware as been a generator (like supercollider) that is externally told what to do...</p>

<p>I guess this is not dissimilar to what axoloti is currently doing... which is running a patch, that its been created on the computer until is told to stop* and of course, if you have 'live coding' principles, with hot swapping of code, then that relationship between computer and axoloti becomes a more 'continuous one' </p>

<p>(* even running standalone is the same, at some point a computer told it what to do... its just it can carry on doing it autonomously, surviving disconnection from the computer, and even power cycles)</p>

        <p>Moving to libclang is the first step.<br>Without interrupting audio, I think it is not possible, some extra time will be spent on saving states and restoring states, generating extra load.<br>Hotswapping partial code - like a single object - implies the use of function pointers so they can be modified, but non-inlined functions can add significant overhead. Modifying inlined code is <br>I'm not sure if saving/restoring state is really needed, I think accelerating compile/upload/init would be good enough. Saving/restoring states adds a risk of getting into a state that is not reached anymore by re-initializing a patch. <br>I think the G2 did not save/restore states when you add an object to a patch.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I assumed inlining makes it an 'all or nothing', and similarity I've seen talk that llvm jit produces non optimized code.... and agreed functions generally have a context overhead. </p>

<p>But perhaps this is where trade offs can be made, having functional call at sample level, is obviously a no go, but the a few function calls at k-rate , with caveats may be not too much. </p>

<p>Of course excessive use will cause cpu load, but perhaps you are willing to trade that for other areas of patch complexity.<br>( perhaps you one f call does a lot of work, that would otherwise be split over lots of objects inefficiently. )</p>

<p>Audio interruption is more a concern, though we are already pushing data back and forth, perhaps as long as the swap is done over multiple k-rate cycles, it can be reduced, so no one k-rate cycle causes an overrun. <br>( the actual code switch is merely a pointer change , it's the data transfer I see as the issue.)</p>

<p>Of course there also here , is a requirement that the patch leaves enough memory to have two versions of the switchable code.  Again a compromise of resources    </p>

<p>I'll admit though , the more constraints I place on how and when code can be switched, and how it can interest with the rest of the patch , perhaps the less useful it becomes.   </p>

<p>Hmmmmmm.</p>

I just need to introduce a new function... hmm, Im thinking perhaps this is possible in a similar way to the way a patch currently works. having a special 'upload' section, and then being careful about how I switch between code i.e. you flip between an active code, and uploaded code, at a safe point e.g. next k-rate run.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eother user

environment...\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ethis one is easier to imagine applying to axoloti, and has previously been discussed a bit in \u003ca href=\"//community.axoloti.com/t/dsl-alternative-to-gui-patcher/1326\"\u003ethis thread\u003c/a\u003e , the 'obvious' solution is to create a patch file, and compile it... and some clever programming/language bindings could even expose axoloti objects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI also wondered about the 'nature' of the interaction between axoloti and a 'client computer'.\u003cbr\u003ee.g. imagine axoloti hardware as been a generator (like supercollider) that is externally told what to do...\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI guess this is not dissimilar to what axoloti is currently doing... which is running a patch, that its been created on the computer until is told to stop* and of course, if you have 'live coding' principles, with hot swapping of code, then that relationship between computer and axoloti becomes a more 'continuous one' \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(* even running standalone is the same, at some point a computer told it what to do... its just it can carry on doing it autonomously, surviving disconnection from the computer, and even power
