    <title>Just starting - a few questions</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/just-starting-a-few-questions/2926</link>
    <description>I just received my first AxoCore and started to dive into custom objects right away. I struggle with very simple things but the web and forum search doesn&#39;t bring up a lot of info. So... here are some questions:

1. I&#39;m trying to create an object that has a buffer of configurable size. I figured, an attribute might be the right thing to use for the buffersize. Looking at other objects, I see that they use &quot;attr_xyz&quot; in the code, but once it&#39;s compiled, that is replaced with the actual value. I also see attributes used in preprocessor statements, so my assumption is that attributes are like a pre-preprocessor, right?
When I add an attribute &quot;buffsize&quot; (min: 1, max: 100) and add this line into my objects local data section `int16_t delayline[attr_buffsize];` I get an error saying `xpatch.cpp:43:16: error: &#39;attr_buffsize&#39; was not declared in this scope`. So, why is my attribute not replaced with its corresponding value?
2. I created my object as a object/object in a blank patch. How can I save it to my library? The XML-tab doesn&#39;t update, so I can&#39;t just copy that. I can copy it from the *.axp file, but is that the preferred way?
3. What do I choose for the uuid of a new object?
4. Is there a difference between datatypes like `frac32.bipolar` and `frac32` apart from the different logo in the patcher?

Sorry for those dumb questions... I really didn&#39;t find answers via the forum search...</description>

              <p>thetechnobear, thank you for your answers. Apparently, re-opening the patch solved all issues for me. </p>

<ol>
<li>Somehow the GUI wasn't consistent. After reopening, the attribute was still named <code>a1</code>, while it definitely said <code>buffsize</code> before. I also noticed that pressing the <code>add</code> button on the <code>displays</code> page didn't seem to do anything. Now, after I re-opened the patch, I can see several entries in the list that didn't show up before re-opening. Looks like there are some issues with the gui.</li>
<li>Thanks, I tried right-clicking the object but I didn't try the <code>file</code> menu. Thanks! BTW: After re-opening the patch, the XML tab shows the updated data now.</li>
</ol>
