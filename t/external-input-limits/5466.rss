    <title>External input limits?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/external-input-limits/5466</link>
    <description> I&#39;ve had an idea bouncing around in my head but I want to make sure that it&#39;s possible before I set it in motion, and a few tips on how to do It would be great. It takes 16 buttons that would be played like a drum pad or keyboard, 4 knobs, a screen, and a few buttons used for navigation. I understand real basic circuitry and wiring but it gets foggy when resistors are thrown in and anything more complex than a capacitor is an enigma to me. I know y&#39;all probably get a ton of questions like this but after scanning through some recent topics I couldn&#39;t find anything.</description>

              <p>Well after looking up wiring diagrams and such I found out that 16 buttons should be possible, but having four knobs and navigation buttons as well isn't, and that's not even getting into leds. A shift register or two could help with that though, so I'll give that a shot. <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>

              <p>The way to do this, if you want to avoid MIDI (and you can certainly biuld your own MIDI devices) is probably to use piezo sensors, connected to the Axo through a shift register. I don’t know for certain if there’s a shift register object, but it’s definitely possible. You then extend the pulses of the piezos using a capacitor and resistor to make sure the shift register can see then as it cycles through.</p>

<p>You can read about shift registers here: <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/shift-registers/all" rel="nofollow noopener">https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/shift-registers/all</a></p>

<p>However, what I’d do is build a MIDI device. Without any fancy footwork, an Arduino can handle 11 or so inputs, 13 with neglible footwork (i.e. making sure pins 0 and 1 are disconnected when you flash the firmware, then reconnect them). Then, getting it to speak MIDI is really easy: it’s just a library that you call in your code.</p>

<p>If you need more inputs, you can use two Arduini (use a Nano — you can get them for less than $3 apiece), either both as separate MIDI devices or just having one speak to the other with PWM.</p>

<p>If you like myself dont have a lot of knowledge about hardware stuff, it is a huge project to get started on. </p>

<p>Anyway, I wish you good luck with it <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>I have a few midi controllers, but I was planing on making it standalone portable unit. That, and it's cheaper and more fun to make my own thingo. Thanks for the response though!</p>

              <p>A bit iff topic, but might be a simpler solution:</p>

<p>You could just get any usb midi controller with velocity sensitive pads and  connect it directly to Axoloti via USB. If you need velocity sensitivity at all. If you dont, well them there are TONS of options.</p>

<p>If you want something that got a little bit of everything I think maybe Novation LaunchKey mini might be a good solution It is pretty cheap too and it has 16 velocity sensitive pads, a keyboard and 8 knobs. I have one but did not test it with Axo yet, as I use it mostly with Pure Data. But I can try it tomorrow if you are interested in knowing about it.</p>

<p>That is probably a lot easier than starting building stuff.</p>
