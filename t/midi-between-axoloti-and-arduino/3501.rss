    <title>Midi between Axoloti and Arduino</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/midi-between-axoloti-and-arduino/3501</link>
    <description>I am about to embark on some coding in Arduino to send and receive midi with Axoloti.
All of my midi experience to date is just from a keyboard, pc or Axo to a sound module.
One direction which is easy to almost just plug in and go for it.
I have all my resources for code etc, but I just have some questions to clear up my understanding when sending / receiving CC messages through midi when using the Axoloti.
As through use with the Axo patcher and supporting documents, when patching and linking a parameter to a CC value, all relative midi channels are being listened too, and this is what confuses me about how best to set it all up.
If I am receiving on all channels, if data is being sent to the Axo on channel 1, can I send back out on channel 1 with out causing issues to the inbound data which is received by the Axo while listening to all channels ? or should I define and separate all my receiving and sending channels ? All the midi will be sent and received over the Axo uart.
Just trying to get my head around what the best approach would be.
Thanx..

              <p>Axo listens on the channel set in the patch preferences. If using UART see Hug's Midi IO patch in the community library on how to do it. Sending and receiving channels are separate streams. They can't be confused.</p>
