    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/module-requests/1858</link>
    <description>I hope it&#39;s ok if I post this here.
I&#39;ld like to see to how far I would be able to make objects &quot;on request&quot;. I know my own ideas go quite fast, just wondering how far I would come if I&#39;ld be coding other people&#39;s ideas..

So, if anyone is in a real need of a module, please, post it below.

Couple of &quot;rules&quot;:
1- the idea must be possible (eg. super long fft calculations won&#39;t be possible, so don&#39;t even ask..)
2- module should be usable for the rest of the community, and as so, could be viewed as &quot;necessary&quot; to be added to the library.
3- if the module is made, PLEASE, delete your request, so to keep things tidy in here.
4- if someone is already working on a module, send a message to the requester (is that the word?), so he can update his request, noting that it&#39;s already being taken care off.
5- NO RESPONSES ON MESSAGES!  ONLY REQUESTS!!! if you want to respond to someone, send him a personal message!

*update 19/6/2016 -8 new modules are created (I had a really good day coding haha)</description>

              <p>this should be doable with the available modules around.<br>eg. you could use a counter and use a comparator to set after which step the break goes in. When the comparator goes high, you could trigger events, add effects, change counting order, etc.<br>Thing is, a break just ain't made by a single module, but can be made by momentarily changing some parameters that "break down" the current rhythm/melody. Though some of my delay/effect modules could be useful for breaks.</p>

<p>1st parameter : loops length 1-2-4-8-16...<br>2nd parameter : break length 1 time,4,...<br>3rd parameter : nature of break (for exemple, release note length increases during the break, or reverb effect increases during the break, or transpose the melody) or any automatic change during the break and at the end of the break the sound is automaticaly revert to the original sound.</p>

<p>Do you think it could be a good project?</p>

<p>Perhaps it s already exists?</p>

              <p>Hello Sir<br>Just tried the ScaleLive objects and they work well, just as I expected, but I did find a small bug : the result of the scaleLIVE object needs a +1 object on it's output for it to be right.<br>And other small thing, if ever someone puts a 0 in the notes input, the whole patcher and card freezes (I suppose it's dividing by zero or something) and needs to be unplugged / re-plugged to work again.<br>It's no big problem, but I thought I would mention it.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I tried the <strong>sss/delay/repeater</strong> object, and I was wondering if it was normal that the loop is played in reverse ?</p>

<p>"scaleLIVE"<br>This module is used to actually quantize your note-data. Just has an note in&amp;output and an object reference to refer to the scalebankLIVE module.

              <p>Thank you Sir, so very much, it seems to be exactly what I wanted. <br>Don't worry about the "most played notes version" It was only mentioned for imagining the scales morph slowly one too the other (by getting rid of some notes, and adding others). But I imagine in practice it could give very ugly results (kind of like when I try to play jazz, once I've found the scale, someone's changes it <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/roll_eyes.png?v=5" title=":roll_eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":roll_eyes:"> ).<br>What you have done up to now seems to be perfect for my projects. <br>Thanks oh so much once again (please get some sleep in, you deserve all the comfort needed !)</p>

              <p>I've created two objects that work together. One gathers the notes being played on it's input, the other functions to scale note CV's to the notes that are allowed. If no notes have been played, all notes are allowed.<br>There's a "clear" input to clear and start over.<br>Note though, that instead of the harmony factory-module's way to directly translate incoming notes to the amount of notes in the scale (if allowed 4 notes, the input will use 0,1,2,3 to play these notes, 4,5,6,7 would be next octave, no matter what their actual note-value is, resulting in a messed up order of your keys). This module will look at what the closest note allowed is below the actual played note, keeping the octave the same.<br>Eg. if only notes 0 and 6 are on, playing note 0 up to 11 would result in: 0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6</p>

<p>Also, if you'ld want the factory-kind of way of ordering the notes, you should have a look at the midi-tab in the object patcher of this harmony factory-module. Here it is shown which midi-notes control the on/off state of each of the 12 notes.</p>

<p>ps. it's 12 o'clock now. I haven't synced my library yet as I also want to make the other option of 'most played notes'. As this would need a different approach.</p>

<p><em>update</em><br>I might perhaps do the "most played notes" version later on. Maybe I'm a bit too tired from my sleep-shift at work to get my head around it and to get it being useful, but at the moment I don't really see how I could make this practical for live use.. To me, the first version seems way more useful..</p>

<p>I do understand you need some kind of priority for the choice of notes, maybe the first “n” being played, or even better, some kind of statistic based table (the notes being played the most).</p>

<p>It could result in amazing improvised performances where one main player could influence the whole harmony in real-time just by playing different notes.</p>

<p>Voilà, that’s my idea, do what you want with it (and if anyone else has any thoughts about it...)</p>

              <p>well, finally starting to get a more or less complete loading system:<br>At the moment I've got 3 sample-loading systems/modules which can be used together.<br>They can be put one after another and load their samples to a single table or each to their own table (eg. basskicks,snares, hihats each get their own tables), so it's up to you to decide how you handle your samples.</p>

<p>-select by name: <br>use directories&amp;names to load 8 samples in a row. Useful in case you want to load a specific set of samples from different folders and/or different names.</p>

<p>-select by ordered indexnumber: <br>using the same prefix, this loads a set of samples in consecutive indexnumbers, eg. <br>drum001 up to drum008, useful to load preset drumskits where you've made sure that the index numbers relate to drum-types, eg. basskick is dr001,dr009,dr017. snare is dr002,dr010,dr018, etc.</p>

<p>-random selection of samples within a range of indexnumbers:<br>using the same prefix, but random indexnumbers, you set the lowest index number and range for the index that could be randomly selected. Currently this index goes from 000 up to 999, so you could randomly combine samples from a set of 1000 samples.</p>

<p>As for the sample playing, I've made 3 different modules:<br>-a complex sampler with start, loopstart,loopend and end positions, reverse, repeat on/off (using loop positions and only for sample 2, but sample selection for 1 and 2 can be swapped with a gate-input), 2 samples with an tiltable envelope to mix between them and of course individual pitch control for both samples.<br>-a simple multi sampler to trigger 4 different samples, each with their own pitch-control, sample-select and gate inputs.<br>-wavetable-oscillator with zero-crossing detection that can use the sounds to create weird bass/glitch sounds. Sounds are created by setting sample-index, start-position within sample and amount of zero-crossings in the loop.</p>

              <p>Cheers Remco, and nah, was nothing to do with anti-aliasing, it was just the desire to morph between two waveforms rather than blend between their levels (although I do like blending between levels too, it's just a different effect).  It's really that knob on the Streichfett that got me curious, cause it sounds as if its actually morphing between waveforms rather than blending between them (I could be wrong though).</p>

<p>Sounds as if you might have something what I was after already though, so thanks for the heads-up about them.  Form what you've told me about them, it looks like only square with PWM and S&amp;H is missing, so it would be cool to have those versions as well, but either way it does sound as if the ones you've created are the sort of thing I'm after.</p>

<p>Will be having a play with those!</p>

              <p>Ah ok, I think I understand.<br>There are just a couple of things I'm a bit skeptical about whether it is usable in the axoloti because of the limited cpu/memory.<br>If you want to use anti-alliased waveform generators, this will take an individual generator for each waveform. As the blepped-oscillators take around 3-5%, a single "morphable oscillator" with sine, tri, saw, ramp and square will already use roughly 18%, so this will already limit the amount of oscillators you could use quite a bit as you'll also still need filters, gain, morphing, etc.</p>

<p>For what you want to do, I think I've already made a couple of modules.<br>So for this I think the best way to go would be to use 4 bleppedCore&amp;slave modules, so you could combine any of the waveforms. After this a simple allpass filter after each waveform to offset the various phases of the frequencies so you can set which of the frequencies will neutralise or strengthen each other.<br>To blend the waveforms, you could use the "mux/smoothRotator4A". This module is basically your morphing mixer that allows different ways to morph through the input waveforms:<br>1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4<br>1-&gt;3-&gt;2-&gt;4<br>1-&gt;4-&gt;3-&gt;2<br>(though not sure about the second, I can update this module so you could select between different orders from an internal table. As it's just 4 inputs, the amount of combinations isn't that big, so wouldn't need too much memory)</p>

<p>As for the morphing control, I've been working on a couple of modules to save presets and morph between them, but it's a bit hard to really make a universal control for this that is easily customisable to the amount of controls that people need.</p>

<p>Btw, if you need oscillators for a bass, you don't necessarily need anti-alliased oscillators. I've made several oscillators that are able to morph between sine,tri,saw and pulse and anything in between as it's either based on mathematical shaping or different ways of self-modulation (last one can go into a bit higher pitches without alliasing)<br>some morphable oscillators:<br>STO<br>SiTriSaPu_OSC<br>bassOsc<br>classic (this one is self-modulating through phase and FM and is personally one of my own favorites)<br>rubisik (two source waveforms and self-modulation&amp;mixing with their own selectable waveforms, though by far not anti-alliased)<br>sawtrimod (saw/triangle/ramp)<br>sintri (sine/triangle)<br>trisaw (another saw/triangle/ramp)</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>It sounds like you have the right basic idea, but I'll split it up and be very precise.</p>

<p>What I'm requesting is really a set of objects that comprises of a Morphing Mixer that has at least two inputs that is specifically designed to take a Morphable Oscillator.</p>

<ul>
<li>Morphable Oscillator object only needs to come in one variant.</li>
<li>Morphing Mixer object could come in 2,3,4,5,6 or more input variants to take Morphable Oscillators.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Morphable Oscillator:</strong></p>

<p>The Morphable Oscillator is basically a single oscillator object with dials on it that allow you to dial-in a custom procedurally produced waveform by dialing-in any mixture of Sine, Square, Triangle, Ramp Up, Ramp Down, Noise, S&amp;H etc, in varying amounts to create the oscillator waveform.  The waveform it creates is just a single cycle and is looped to create the oscillation just like regular oscillators do.  The important thing about it is that the waveform is generated procedurally so that it's parameters can be morphed from one custom waveform to another.  However, the actual morphing is not handled by the oscillator object, it is handled by a Morphing Mixer object designed to drive it.</p>

<p><strong>The Morphing Mixer Object:</strong></p>

<p>The role of the Morphing Mixer is to take multiple Morphable Oscillators and morph between them using just a single dial.  The amount of Morphing Oscillators it has to morph between, is determined by the variant of the object itself.  For example, a 2-Input Morphing Mixer would accept just two Morphable Oscillators.  Having the dial set to minimum would output the waveform of the first Morphable Oscillator, and set to maximum you would hear only the second.  Twelve o'clock position would output a 50/50 morph of the two Morphable Oscillators.</p>

<p>It gets even better the more inputs a Morphing Mixer object has.  So a 3-Input Morphing Mixer for example, would output only oscillator 1 at minimum value, only oscillator 3 at maximum value, and only oscillator two at twelve o'clock.  Moving between minimum and twelve o'clock would give you a morph between oscillator 1 and 2, and moving between twelve o'clock and maximum would give you a morph between oscillator 2 and 3.</p>

<p>It basically works the same no matter how many inputs the Morphing Mixer has, cause all it does is divide the knob travel by how many inputs it has.  So basically, this mixer is driving the oscillators attached to it, because turning the dial basically sends the signals to the attached Morphable Oscillators, telling them how they need to adjust their parameters in order to morph from one waveform to another.</p>

<p>Quite a task I suppose, but remember there are really only two main object designs.  The Morphing Mixer objects are all basically the same, they only differ in how many inputs they have.  And the Morphable Object is just one object that the user adds to the patch how many they need.  The oscillators differ because the oscillators themselves are customisable by the user adjusting the oscillators dials.</p>

<p>I suppose you could even skip the Morphing Mixer objects altogether and it would still work, cause basically, all the user would have to do is attach their own form of modulation to the Morphable Oscillators.  It would be nice to have those purpose-built Morphing Mixers for them though, that would be much more elegant and feel like a full-on complete 'system' in its own right.</p>

<p>Crazy or what? <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>
