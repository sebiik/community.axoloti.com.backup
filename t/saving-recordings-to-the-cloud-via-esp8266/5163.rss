    <title>Saving Recordings to the Cloud via ESP8266</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/saving-recordings-to-the-cloud-via-esp8266/5163</link>
    <description>I&#39;m really enjoying using Axoloti and have managed to make a patch that allows my kids to make short 5 second recordings to tables and manipulate their voices - which they love. 

I&#39;d like to add an ESP8266 via UART so that I can save recordings they make to the cloud. I&#39;ve read everything I can in the forum regarding adding wifi and recording and I&#39;m seeking advice on the easiest way to accomplish this. 

As far as I can tell to accomplish this I would need to transfer the bytes in blocks over SD2 UART using the ChibiOS Serial library functions as seen in the gpio/serial/serial.ahx example to the ESP8266 and then relay those bytes to the cloud - but I&#39;m not sure if this is the best method... 

My questions are:
1) ESP8266 example? 
Has anyone ever connected an ESP8266 to Axoloti? I&#39;d love to study example code if any exists. I&#39;ve used Micropython WEBRepl to transfer files on the ESP8266, but am unsure of how to use AT commands with Axoloti. 

2) How to record 30 seconds... 
Recording long files seems difficult because of the write speed of various SD cards. Could I use a table to store 30 seconds of audio and then transfer the bytes from SDRam to the ESP8266 to bypass the difficulty of storage to sd-card? It seems possible to store up to 50 seconds of raw data to 8mb of RAM at 24bit sampling rate of 48K but tables seem limited to about 5.4 seconds of audio if the allocation size is 262144 samples.</description>
