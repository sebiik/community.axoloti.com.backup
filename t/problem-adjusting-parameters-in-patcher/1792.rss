    <title>Problem adjusting parameters in patcher</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/problem-adjusting-parameters-in-patcher/1792</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve encountered a problem with the Axoloti patcher which I have not seen before. I&#39;m trying to run the Axoloti Patcher under Debian Wheezy (because that&#39;s what we use at work), building it from source.

I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve tried this before with success, but now I get the odd behavior that when I point to a parameter dial and try to drag it to change the value, the parameter immediately jumps to its minimum value and the mouse pointer disappears; when the left mouse button is released.

I&#39;ve tried versions 1.0, 1.0.9, 1.0.10 and the latest dev, with the same results. There&#39;s nothing else that I&#39;ve seen that doesn&#39;t seem to work.

If I run the prepackaged versions it works. So, perhaps something with the java build environment, but it&#39;s been downloaded and installed by the build process and there are no complaints about it when building.

Since the prepackaged version (Debian package) works fine, and I don&#39;t have problems building on my Debian Jessie machine at home, this is not a big issue, but I thought perhaps someone else had come across it and knew what the problem was.</description>
