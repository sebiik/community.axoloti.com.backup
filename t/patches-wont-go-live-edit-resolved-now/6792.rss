    <title>Patches won&#39;t go live (EDIT: Resolved now)</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/patches-wont-go-live-edit-resolved-now/6792</link>
    <description>Hi, I recently had to reinstall Windows and since doing so patches won&#39;t go live, everytime I try the error in the screenshot shows up and the axo disconnects.
Have tried downloading/reinstalling both the runtime and .msi files several times (including the java options) but no luck.
Never had any issues before the reinstall so don&#39;t know why it&#39;s not working now.
I&#39;m running Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (I saved the runtime folder to Program Files (x86) and tried the 32-bit folder one time just in case).

Thanks in advance!
Kieran

EDIT: I also noticed an issue with Command Prompt closing as soon as I tried to open it, followed this link to get cmd prompt working and patches go live now: https://www.techsupportforum.com/threads/windows-10-command-prompt-closes-immediately.1223026/page-2
