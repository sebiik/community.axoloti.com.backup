    <title>Creating a real time quantized auto pitch shifter</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/creating-a-real-time-quantized-auto-pitch-shifter/7052</link>
    <description>What people calls &quot;autotune&quot;, a quantized real time pitch corrector.
My idea was to drive a pitch shifter with incoming pitch tracking information, but the question is how to scale pitch detection to semitone +/- offset. i will have to set a reference root note and the target pitches.
anybody has ideas about useful objects for this kind of project?
anybody has any experience on this kind of processing?
thanks and i will update this topic with news</description>

    Hi, 

I’m looking for a way for the pitch of an oscillator to follow an external audio signal 

Ideally I’d like to take a fixed snapshot value of the incoming audio signal, and have an oscillator play a note based on that value 

Any tips greatly appreciated! 

Thank you

    I made a video about a guitar synth I made with axo recently. The patch is a mess (sorry) but it works great,and there's a link to it below if you want to try it or take things from it. Thanks again to community contributors who make amazing objects, otherwise this stuff wouldn't be possible for me.

<p>Start from there and see what you can grab, for the pitch tracking. </p>

<p><strong>Pitch shifting:</strong><br>There are numerous pitch shifters in the user library. If you want to make your own, it's a little bit more work. You can make a pitch shifter fromthis tutorial patch:<br>File&gt;Library&gt;Factory&gt;tutorial&gt;22_overlap_add_shift</p>

<p>But it does need a lot of work it's just a starting point. So it's probably easier just to use one of the already existing ones to start with. </p>

<p>Get something working and then you can always upgrading specific parts of the algo if you are not happy with them.</p>
