    <description>Just looking for anyone in the U.S. that has purchased and received the Axoloti and how long did it take and where are you from? I&#39;m in California, Bay Area and ordered one of these amazing devices and although it&#39;s only been a couple of days I am already fraught with anticipation! I apologize if this isn&#39;t in the correct place.</description>

              <p>I live on the east coast (Virginia).  Ordered two on 7/19, they were processed/shipped 7/21 and I had them by 7/29 so there wasn't a long delay at all. Arrived faster than I expected.</p>
