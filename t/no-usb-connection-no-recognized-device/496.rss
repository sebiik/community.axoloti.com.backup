    <title>No USB Connection - no recognized device</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/no-usb-connection-no-recognized-device/496</link>
    <description>Hello,

I have two axoloti boards. One of them is working without problems, the other one is not recognized by windows. When I plugged it in the first time, a firmware update request is showing up and I did it, but since then, it is not recognized anymore. I think I bricked it :frowning:</description>

              <p>k, dont panic .... <br>updating the firmware really cant 'brick' the unit, and the cases of boards failures has been extremely low<br>(the firmware is stored in a  section of memory which can be updated again easily)</p>

<p>are there any LEDs lit  on the board?  are there any devices shown in windows related to the Axoloti board?</p>

<p>first solution attempt is:</p>

<ul>
<li>boot into DFU mode, this is described in the installation guide as 'rescue mode'<br><a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/installing-on-windows/36">http://community.axoloti.com/t/installing-on-windows/36</a>
</li>
<li>do firmware update , using rescue mode</li>
</ul>

<p>(when you do the above, you can check to see when you put the board into DFU mode, can you see the axoloti board, again as described in the guide)</p>
