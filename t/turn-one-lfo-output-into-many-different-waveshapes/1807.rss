    <title>Turn one LFO output into many different waveshapes</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/turn-one-lfo-output-into-many-different-waveshapes/1807</link>
    <description>Is there such a thing? I have a Midi to LFO sync object. The midified LFO only spits out 3 different waves. Sine, saw and square. I woul like som different midi syncable lfo waveforms as well, but they are not built into the object.

One solution would be to waveshape for instance, the square output of the midified LFO, into different shapes, but is there an easier way? Like an LFO with a freq follower input or something?
Thanks:)</description>

              <p>I'd say waveshaping is the way to go. If you're using drj/lfo/lfo_sync, there's pwm, triangle saw, and sine which can all be shaped by a few simple modules. E.g. the bipolar triangle into a math/sin, sine through math/wrap or multiplying saw and tri with a math/* will give you something already, the saw can be used to look up tables and so on. I'm sure there are purpose made wave shaper objects in the libraries as well.</p>
