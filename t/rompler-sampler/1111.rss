    <title>Rompler / sampler</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/rompler-sampler/1111</link>
    <description>hello everyone,
My name is Dimitri and I just discovered Axoloti.
What I&#39;d like to do is making a simple rompler/sampler, something like the Emu Emulator II.
Those would be my requisites:

1) 6 or 8 notes of polyphony
2) samples are stereo, 16 bit, 44.1kHz (I guess I&#39;d need to convert them to 48kHz)
3) samples are stored on the SD card (I don&#39;t need sampling on the unit)
3) samples are assigned/loaded onboard with a display (if Axoloti can&#39;t by itself, maybe with the help of an Arduino or similar)
4) you can assign a sample to a key (a midi note), so potentially you can have 128 samples loaded, one different sample for each key.
5) or, you can assign a sample to all the keys, so samples should be pitch shifted, relatively to the root key/note (so you can play the same sample at different pitch simultaneously).
6) or, a combination of 4) and 5), so you choose a range of keys for one particular sample, and the other keys can play other samples.

If I&#39;m asking too much from Axoloti, I&#39;m sorry, I discovered it only now so I&#39;m still trying to understand what it can do. 
:)

  <blockquote>Hi. I dont have an Axoloti, but i have a project that i would like to use it for. I have sampled an old organ. I have sampled all the white keys, and all the different soundbanks it has. 

Many of the samples have a fast attack and then an even sustain/decay. The actual looping would be of the tail of the sound. 

Will i be able to create custom loop start/loop end points for each sample? Or should the loop points already be embedded in the sample via 3rd party software? 

Thanks
