    <title>&quot;Getting Started with Axoloti&quot; book, still up to date?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/getting-started-with-axoloti-book-still-up-to-date/4870</link>
    <description>Hello Axoloti community, 

I have received my Axoloti core and am very eager to learn it so I can build the synths of my dreams. I am aware of the book &quot;Getting Started with Axoloti&quot; that came out in 2016 and I just want to see if the information is still current in regards to the objects and their functionality. I read the sample and liked the presentation and found it very helpful so hoping it will serve as a handy resource.

Thanks!</description>

              <p>As <a class="mention" href="/u/thetechnobear">@thetechnobear</a> said, the only "new" thing introduced since the book was released is embedded subpatches. An update with some additions and changes is definitely due, but I haven't got the time yet to start writing.</p>

              <p>I bought the book maybe a month ago and the version is from March 2016. It is not updated for embedded patches, I had to search the forums to get that piece working. </p>

<p>Still a useful resource for a complete novice like myself.</p>

              <p>does it cover embedded patches?<br>that's probably the biggest change to patching since initial release. <br>(but just makes it easier than having to save subpatches , rather than any conceptual changes)</p>

<p>I thought <a class="mention" href="/u/janvantomme">@janvantomme</a> mentioned somewhere he might do updates? â€¦ but could be Im mis-remembering.</p>
