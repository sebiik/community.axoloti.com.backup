    <title>Hook and hookmod not working as expected</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/hook-and-hookmod-not-working-as-expected/4662</link>
    <description>I was trying to use the demux to control several dials from one single pot, and because it wasn&#39;t working I searched here on the forum and ended up trying the &#39;hook&#39; and &#39;hookmod&#39; objects, these object are doing what is expected, but there is a big delay when I change the target dial. 

Looking at the help file I&#39;ve replaced the first dial by a &#39;random drift&#39; object to be always updating values while I change the destination as you can see in the image, sometimes the target dial stays quiet for a couple of seconds..

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/a/ac3f4e2432ff728af143559be766eb7f24bf90d8.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;302&quot;&gt;

is this happening only to me? it there any other way to have the same logic with different objects?</description>

              <p>Yeah if its that much delay It doesn't have to do with order of execution.</p>

<p>I am not sure what to say more here. Sorry <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

<p>I dont hav any idea what could introduce such a delay.</p>

<p>The delay is quite inconsistent, goes from 1 to 8 seconds.<br>I tried your example and the delays were also there.</p>

<p>I removed the wires from the unhook inlet and now it is much more responsive, seems to be instantaneous. I don't know what is the job of this inlet, but I will try with this approach.</p>

              <p>How big delay?</p>

<p>You could try to fix the order of execution so everything is processed in the right order.</p>

<p>All those cable going up can cause some delay, but very little, so I am not sure thats your problem.</p>

<p>You can also check this patch here I made a while ago, its for controlling several parameters from a single knob. I dont recall having any delay issues with that one. Maybe you can clean it up and take only what you need?</p>

<blockquote><p>Try this one out. I have made a test version for the 6 knobs. You use the first button on the right to choose between layer 1 &amp; 2. It is pretty sijple to add the last stuff from here. Or else you can also check Tom Whitwells patch on Github. It shows how to set up everything. You need to use <span class="mention">@hellcores</span> hookmod object for this patch to work.  There are 2 versions. One that uses the cv from the gpio directly and one that converts the gpios to midi cc. Layer 1 is midi cc 1-6 and layer 2 is midi ccâ€¦</p></blockquote></aside>
