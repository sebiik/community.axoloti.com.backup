    <title>Not only Axoloty, but</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/not-only-axoloty-but/5424</link>
    <description>OK... as per topic, Axo isn&#39;t the sole ingredient, but _one of them_. 
Nevertheless, in many cases it solved a lot of problems, other instruments (hard &amp; software) showed not to be able to.
The making of an entire album from A to Z is a very though, time consuming and steep course.
Axo did its part.

A long time passed since I started this project... and finally we published it!
&quot;We&quot; are «Arancione Oltremare», a duo (Davide Di Donato singer and songwriter + **me**... music, arrangements, keyboards, synth programming, FXs and other gimmicks, mix, mastering), featuring some excellent musicians for all those instruments we can&#39;t play.
Basically it&#39;s a pop album, with various influences of rock, prog, dance and... a bit of jazz too. All in all, our life.
It&#39;s title &quot;Saremo Giovani&quot; (= we will be young) is the concept. A bunch of good and bad love stories encouraging ourselves to never give up. 14 tracks, 12 original plus two &quot;bonus&quot; live takes. 12 italian lyrics, 2 english, one is a Elton John&#39;s cover.
...
Best istance of Axo:
In the chorus of track 5 (&quot;Questa Autostrada&quot; = this motorway) you can hear the Axoloti playing the bassline. Very powerful! It gave me the power of a fat stereo bass, without phase issues.
You can easily find our work on the major digital stores, so if you want to hear the fat Axoloti, just listen to the preview of the above mentioned track.

I&#39;ll put some link ASAP...</description>
