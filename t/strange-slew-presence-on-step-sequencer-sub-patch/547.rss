    <title>Strange slew presence on step sequencer sub patch</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/strange-slew-presence-on-step-sequencer-sub-patch/547</link>
    <description>Hello, I am having some trouble with this step sequencer I made. It mostly works, however i&#39;ve found that there is always a noticeable amount of slew between pitch &quot;cv&quot; level changes, and im not sure why. I ahve it set up so that there is a k-rate filter operating as an actual slew, however i have it also set up so that the slew generator can be completely removed from the signal path. However i find that even in this scenario(slew muxed out) it still has a noticeable slew between pitch on steps, like if i set step 1 to -34, and step two to -24, and step 3 to -34 with the glide/slew/portamento disabled, and with the gate out of the steps 1 and 3 disabled, it will still have a noticeable pitch slew effect on step 2(sliding  in from step 1&#39;s value to step 3&#39;s value) Any advice, or help would be welcome. Feel free to modify or use these sequencers for whatever you feel like also.

              <p>i included the gate sequencer subpatch as it is a part of the stepsequencer sub patch as well and i believe will need to be placed in the same folder as it for it to work properly. I place them in the objects folder myself for ease of use with the other sequencer type things.</p>
