        <p>what "coding"?</p>

<p>the problem I think is the phrase is just too generic... I still dont know what you mean to discuss outside what is pretty normal patching ... </p>

<p>on reflection seeing your post, i don't think developer is the right one, as I meant that more for topics about the development of axoloti (as its open source) , so pretty low level, stuff that many users dont want to see.</p>

<p>discourse , recommends that the number of categories is actually kept quite limited, <br>as otherwise users get confused about where to put stuff....<br>but at the other end, you don't just want a general category where everything gets dumped an no one can find it <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>i will admit, 'software' does tend to get used for this a bit, the difference between 'software' and 'patching' categories i think is lost on many (which is fair enough, perhaps one too many categories <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ) </p>

<p>of course, also categories done really matter much ... I think many tend to view 'latest' posts, so see them whatever category they are in, and Id dont really 'moderate' much, so doesn't matter too much (unless its really obvious in the wrong place)</p>

        <p>ok, Ive moved it all here for, as its a discussion about where to do this <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> </p>

<p>again, I kind of repeat my first question...</p>

<p>what do you think is going to be discussed in it?<br>and how may posts are likely to be in it?</p>

<p>I guess we could have a category which is for 'object coding', but it just seems like a really narrow topic,  one Ive not really seen that many posts for.</p>

<p>I guess it could be argued, perhaps a general category for 'axoloti objects' could be useful....<br>but then thats overlaps with patching, as people are going to start asking questions about particular objects, or objects they want etc etc.</p>

<blockquote><p>ja  right but ...the threat how to code objects is now at 75 entries and its getting unübersichtlich.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>yeah, but looking through it, its a 'grab bag' of posts, some about the editor, some about the code declarations, some bugs.</p>

<p>hmmm, tricky one... <br>ideally, most of the stuff covered in that topic, would be in a help topic.... 'creating objects'</p>

<p>I dont know really, <a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a>  , whats your thoughts?  </p>

<p>frankly, I can't even thing of a good category name to call it ...  coding I don't think cuts it, as could refer to patching, coding for the UI/firmware. I think it needs to be some how related to the concept of discussing axoloti objects, perhaps excluding patching?</p>

<p>or perhaps we just rename 'patching' to  'patching and objects' or something similar?</p>

<p>Im keen to hear what <a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> (and anyone) else things...</p>

<blockquote><p>..axoloti is such nice tool to leran also about coding....also i dont want to distract johannes and u with answering noob questions....that should be done by community</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>yeah, I think the forum can't do everything, and actually most coding questions have answers at <br>stackoverflow.com (if you google any coding question, usually you'll find its been answered there)</p>

<p>I think the thing is, expectations here... coding is a skill, like playing a piano, it takes time, practice etc , then on top of that you need to know something about DSP programming, again another skill, which requires research and playing with...</p>

<p>I think the reality is, basic coding skills wont get you far,  when creating objects, other than a bit of tinkering...<br>what most want to do, filter design, reverbs etc... takes years of experience in DSP and strong maths... you cannot realistically expect to learn that here, your going to need to go an research that.<br>(there are lots of resources out here for this... though I found, getting the right level can be hard)</p>

<p>I point this out, as Ive 30 years C/C++ experience, so the coding side is trivial for me, but Im finding the DSP side challenging ( my first go at this area). Im not sure Id find it fun, if I was struggling on both the coding and DSP side.</p>

<p>back on topic... and my point is...</p>

<p>Focus... I think there is perhaps a need for an area that talks about coding axoloti objects, things that are specific to coding objects, and its seems natural that, it could stray into DSP....</p>

<p>hmm, Im wondering  the hardware section talks about surrounding circuits, ICs etc  ... but kind of assumes you know the basics ... but is open to questions from beginners about how to get started)<br>(even as a non-hardware guy, I really like the post in the hardware section) </p>

<p>hmm, perhaps the object side, could be more about dsp programming?  as the tendency is when things get more complex, you start coding objects...</p>

<p>but as I said, I'm still unsure... and very much open to ideas about how to make this work well.<br>including possibility changing the focus of, e.g. patching, other categories to make more sense of where things go.<br>(software category is also arguably very vague... when I created it, I intended it to be about the axoloti software, e.g. UI, compilers, firmware etc .... but is tended to be anything that is not patching or hardware related)</p>

<p>so all is open to discussion... and these are just my ideas (which as i said, are far from clear <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> )</p>

        <p>I thought that an 'object coding' section in the forum is a good idea but more importantly, my humble and constructive comment is this: it would be of benefit to expand the documentation on object programming.</p>

<p>There are useful bits here and there and the community kindly answers questions all the time, but beyond patching already existing modules, it is very difficult to get into object programming without knowing first what variables types exist, how to do conversions, how to use the shifting for converting which variable type into which other to achieve defined ranges, and so on. I was expecting this to be available, but so far I am struggling to find such information easily.</p>

<blockquote><p>it would be of benefit to expand the documentation on object programming.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>I completely agree 100%....</p>

<p>but as Ive pointed out before, who do you want to do it?</p>

<p>by implication, 'axoloti staff', which means <a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> ... but I suspect many users would disagree, that documentation should be his priority, as there is so much other useful stuff do be done that require his unique skills. <br>(also there is alot of hidden work e.g. distributing new boards etc) </p>

<p>if we exclude, Johannes, then its down to the community.<br>personally, Ive already spent quite a lot of time writing the user guide, and frankly I don't like writing documentation, so Im kind of done on that side for now, and I'm also a coder familiar with axoloti UI/firmware, so arguably like Johannes, there is probably better stuff I can contribute.</p>

<p>if someone else writes it up, then Im happy to put it in the user-guide section, and from there any user can add/amend it.<br>( hint:  I'm more likely to add/amend that write from scratch <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  )</p>

<p>the community library is already showing we have a strong set of contributors, who willing share there work.<br>similarly the forum, shows there are many users out there willing to share there knowledge and expertise to help others.</p>

<p>perhaps, a few out there would be willing to help on the documentation, theres lots of room for improvement... and keeping it up to date, is time consuming... volunteers would be highly appreciated.</p>

<p>perhaps <a class="mention" href="/users/gabriel">@gabriel</a> you would be willing to start this? <br>Id argue, that there are already a few posts and bits in the user guide, which could be pulled together to form some kind of coherent guide... its more a compilation job initially, and people here will answer questions you may have<br>I will also point at, by doing this, you would learn alot along the way...</p>

        <p>As I said before, this is constructive criticism and fully understand the situation where one person cannot do it all. <br>But... at the end of the day, documentation is really essential. Without it, some people will be put off if they feel unable to do as much as it can be done.<br>Sure, I am happy to help. I will collect the bits of info that I am finding useful, put those into an single document, perhaps create a list of subjects that I feel still require explanation (which hopefully others will be able to fill in) and share it here.</p>

good understanding of Axoloti!

some DSP coding experience/knowledge
xml (optional/useful)
reasonable level of maths (useful, depending upon what you want to do)


as you can see, to create objects... you need a knowledge of a few things,  so first thing its be reasonable in your expectations, a novice programmer/dsp coder is not going to be programming filters/rever…

<p>I highly recommend someone puts in some effort to fill in a few useful 'web resources', books etc to help beginners.  a few of these are mentioned in others posts, so its a matter of users collecting these together.<br>who will do this? ... and who will just expect someone else to do it? </p>

<p>Also, as pointed out earlier, it would be a good idea for someone to collate the current info, and create a topic that can be done in the user-guide... there is already a topic there, but it doesn't go into much detail.</p>
