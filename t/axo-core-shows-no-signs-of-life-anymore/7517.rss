    <title>Axo Core shows no signs of life anymore</title>

    <description>Hey everybody, 
I was breadboarding a small circuit with a transistor, pwm and vdd/gnd pins and an external power supply to drive a motor and suddenly my board turned off.
Now I do not have any Leds responding when connecting a power supply, the board does not show up in the patcher, not even in DFU mode.
I checked voltages in some places on the board and it all seems fine, +5V is giving me +5V and 3,3V is good too.
IC1 seems quite hot though, as well as IC2.

There is no signs of damage on the board…

The only thing that I believe could have happened is a reverse voltage going up to VDD and GND pins while I was breadboarding (maybe the 9V external supply?).
Could that damage the board beyond reparability? How can I be sure that it is officially deceased?

Pretty bummed as the cores are quite rare nowadays and I use them a lot for my live…</description>
