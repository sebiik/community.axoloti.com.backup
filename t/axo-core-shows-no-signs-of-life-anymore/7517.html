<p>There is no signs of damage on the board…</p>

<p>The only thing that I believe could have happened is a reverse voltage going up to VDD and GND pins while I was breadboarding (maybe the 9V external supply?).<br>Could that damage the board beyond reparability? How can I be sure that it is officially deceased?</p>

<p>Pretty bummed as the cores are quite rare nowadays and I use them a lot for my live…</p>
