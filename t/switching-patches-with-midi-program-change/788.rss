    <title>Switching patches with midi program change</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/switching-patches-with-midi-program-change/788</link>
    <description>Hello all, and a big thanks to everyone that are contributing to Axoloti. I&#39;ve been using it for simple synth sounds for a while, but it wasn&#39;t until yesterday I finally got around to exploring the board properly. I&#39;m having tons of fun, but ran into a newbie issue I haven&#39;t been able to solve yet.

I want to be able to switch patches using program change messages from my controller. It works with CCs, like this:&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/2/282f72e6e4f5814a97be55ea5fbada66b9b138bf.png&quot; width=&quot;682&quot; height=&quot;328&quot;&gt;

But when I try to use the pgm object shown in the image instead, it does not. Is there any way to monitor what is output from the pgm? I assume it is not the program change value since it isn&#39;t behaving, so what is pgm outputting?</description>

              <p>Ah, perfect. Exactly what I was looking for, thanks!</p>

<p>I just tried it, and I did in fact get the program change value as an integer. So I reconnected the pgm object again, and now it works!. So whatever was giving me an error before appears to have been fixed by itself. <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

              <p>The easiest way to debug your patches is to use the objects in the <strong>disp</strong> folder. The <strong>disp/i</strong> object in the screenshot shows the output from the <strong>midi/in/pgm</strong> object. Note that the clip in Ableton live is set to program 4, and is displayed as 3 in the Axoloti patcher.</p>
