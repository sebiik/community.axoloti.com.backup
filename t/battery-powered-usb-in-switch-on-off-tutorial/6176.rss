    <title>Battery Powered + USB in + switch ON/OFF Tutorial</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/battery-powered-usb-in-switch-on-off-tutorial/6176</link>
    <description>Hi, today I&#39;ve just make a simple ON/OFF switch to my axo box, allows me to keep the micro USB input for doing two things : 
1. Still have access to the axo-board for making new patch or everything else from outside the box 
2. Charging the battery power bank I&#39;ve placed inside my box.

Now my axo can be turned on &amp; off from be battery powered and work everywhere, or used like just before with my computer or any usb 5v devices.

So for the community I think it might be nice to explain how to do it.

This is what I&#39;ve done :  
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/6/66b14201fffb5ca23e2f83ac88172efe2081941b.png&quot; width=&quot;509&quot; height=&quot;339&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/9/91e05f439ef258f261fb50a89a0c09f396997336.png&quot; width=&quot;280&quot; height=&quot;420&quot;&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1e3ffa4338515ca053fcd9a21b89834f2bc409cc.png&quot; width=&quot;330&quot; height=&quot;331&quot;&gt;

First you need to understand that the power bank don&#39;t transmit any data info to your axo. Because of this I draw in black the USB cable needs data, and in red the usb who don&#39;t need usb data. It really matter because inside a USB cable you&#39;ll have 4 colors of cable. Green &amp; white for data info, red for 5v and black for GND like this picture : 
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/8/824d4d693501c6a84c195eb605fcefed5747f40e.png&quot; width=&quot;458&quot; height=&quot;395&quot;&gt;

You&#39;ll only use a stereo bipolar on/on switch. Make sure it will have 6 branches. like this one I&#39;ve used : 
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a064508294296b39791a3da94dbc13fdf2bdcbc3.png&quot; width=&quot;364&quot; height=&quot;278&quot;&gt;

And I&#39;ve soldered it like this : 
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/4/41a2e2c4bd79b1eda3adf6ecb8886c69badca753.png&quot; width=&quot;403&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;

So now : 
1 : when I plug a USB cable to my female micro USB input, my axo turn on, I still have access to the data info so I still can use it with the axo-patcher or sequence it from a DAW, and the battery is charging in the same time.
2 : when nothing is pluged to this female USB in, the axo is OFF.
3 : Even if nothing is pluged to the female USB in, I can turn on the axo by switching on my little &quot;switch on/on&quot; and the battery start powering the axo-board.

Now set up these little things inside a box, let the switch in a place where you have access, and go outside to play with your new patch &amp; new box everywhere :slight_smile:
