    <title>Help needed on a my new AxoBoxFx project</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/help-needed-on-a-my-new-axoboxfx-project/3659</link>
    <description>Hi,
Probably isn&#39;t the right place for this topic but it&#39;s a multi-category one üòÖ

I plan to realize an FX box with axoloti, that includes knobs, buttons and switches and works as stand alone device with the possibility of save patches, save presets and load them as the most fx machines on the market.

About soldering knobs, buttons and switches to the gpio ports it&#39;s ok, I&#39;ve already assembled them and tested üëåüèª
Now I need to solve the following challenges:

1. I need help about how to save patches and presets on the SDCard and load them directly, without connecting the board to a computer? I see some topics regarding this but not so clear for me ‚òπÔ∏è

2. Connected to point 1, How to connect a  3-4 digit display for selecting patches and presets?

3. How to manage a midi clock/sync in signal for sync an hypothetical lfo and/or dly time?

Thanks a lot for your help</description>

              <p>*.bin is the extension they are saved as on the sdcard.<br>When you are in your patch, the menu at the top under patch, you will see you have several upload options, 2 of which are to the sdcard. this is how you save your patch to the sd card, the current patch name will become the directory, and in that directory you will have a patch.bin file, this is the patch as a file on the sd card.<br>No if you go to help &gt; library &gt; factory &gt; patch, you will see 2 load examples, then second one shows how it is setup for the patch bank.</p>

<p>Now I am a little too concerned about saying to much on loading patches at the moment, because I have run into my own problem, and I am yet to work out what is wrong, and I need to alot of stripping back my work, so I am worried that I might end up giving you the wrong info. But maybe the above will assist you some for now.<br><img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/grinning.png?v=5" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:"></p>

              <p>Answer to 1..<br>There are several methods described on this one, the most popular appears to be using the patch bank. This is should be your first port of call on this one.<br>For me, I wanted to avoid this method, so changing patches was less involved. All patches are saved as "patch.bin", you just need to use a file load object, the file name is generic, but have the directory it is in change. I just use numbers "/001/patch.bin, /002/patch.bin" etc, that way I can use a counter or midi value to select the patch. Note the three digit number format 001, 002, when connecting an integer value to the patch name, it will always default to a three digit value.</p>

<p>Presets are another issue, much discussion on this topic, from what I understand there are even future plans for the Axo UI to help manage this. I expect however many needs are different, and therefore so are options that can be considered.<br>I have my presets stored on an Arduino via a text file and they are uploaded whenever a patch is selected. This more than meets my needs, future plans will allow any changes to be saved as new preset options.<br>There is a community object under "drj/patch" that appears to work well for many users, maybe you want to look into this.</p>

<p>Answer to 2..<br>There are many ways to do this..<br>- There are community objects by "djrm/gpio/spi" for controlling seven segment displays.<br>- You could consider communicating with an Arduino to drive a display of choice etc..<br>- Or if you are keen to do the work, I have posts on how to get an Arduino to display data onto a VGA screen, bit of work involved though building your menus etc.</p>

<p>Sorry I can't assist with the "midi clock/sync" issue, this is a topic I am yet gain experience with.</p>

<p>Maybe this can get you on your way..<br><img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/grinning.png?v=5" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:"></p>
