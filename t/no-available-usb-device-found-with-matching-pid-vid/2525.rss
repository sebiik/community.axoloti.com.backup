    <title>No available USB device found with matching PID/VID</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/no-available-usb-device-found-with-matching-pid-vid/2525</link>
    <description>Hi
I&#39;ve just got the Axoloti Core board. I&#39;m relying on the usb as the power source. When I connect to OS X 10.10.2 the LEDS blink and settle on the green light. When I go to &#39;Board Menu&#39; and select &#39;Select Device&#39; there is no device showing. The dialogue box shows this message:

No available USB device found with matching PID/VID

I replaced the micro usb cable to one that I know for certain transfers data - even so, no result.

Any ideas?

Thanks</description>

              <p>Good try on another machine, also forgot to mention have you tried holding s2 on startup?</p>

<p>Is the axoloticore new or have you bought it second hand? <br>Have you successfully used it in the past or is this the first time you are trying it?</p>

<p>Also just quoting Johannes, try another cable, at this point you're just trying to rule out potential areas of issue, because as from below if it's an unknown hardware issue, who knows what the cause will be....<br></p>

<p>The symptoms you're reporting could be caused by a power-only USB cable, but you have already verified, great!</p>
<p>The next thing to exclude is anything related to firmware. <br>Could you try a "rescue flash": remove power from Axoloti Core, and then connect the micro-USB port to your computer while holding button S1. The LEDs will stay off when in DFU mode.<br>Then select in the Board menu -&gt; Firmware -&gt; Flash (Rescue)...<br>If the LEDs stay off, but you still get "No devices in DFU mode detected.", then this is probably an unknown hardware error...</p>

              <p>Just to second what hitachii is saying, can you startup normally with the SD card removed, just troubleshooting but it could be that your SD startup patch is causing an issue, so just to rule that out. </p>

<p>Also how are you powering the axo, just by USB or external power?</p>

<p>Have you got anything soldered to the board/Gpioâ€™s?</p>

<p>Also just having read about my own issues earlier in this thread, can you try using it on another computer, again that could help isolate where the issue is occurring, I was able to use another macbook with success.</p>

<p>Does the SD card have anything on it? If you plug the SD card into a card reader, try backing the card up, erasing it, putting it back in the Axoloti, and see if that works.</p>

<p>I've tried to run in DFU mode pressing the S1 button but this message is displayed: </p>

<p>No devices in DFU mode detected. </p>

<p>The fact is i've already test the USB cable with my phone to save any files and it's working... By the way i'm on Mac osx (hight sierra)<br>So i really can't know what is the problem and searching on this english forum is a little bit difficult for me cause of my english first and my bad informatic's knowing...</p>

<p>After having the same problem mentioned above with the inability to do the "flash(rescue)" thing I opened the enclosure to find that some components are really hot, specially IC2 and IC1. <br>The LEDs are working like other users in this thread so I assume my Axo its not bricked already.</p>

<p>Also, I've tried 3 different USB cables with no luck as well as reinstalling the software. </p>

<p>the issue you are having is it cannot find /Applications/Axoloti.app, though Ive never see it expressed this way before... </p>

<p>Id check your install on that mac..</p>

<p>what cables have you connected , is this a v1.0 board? if so you need to use a stereo cable.<br>see, <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/axoloti-hardware/59">http://community.axoloti.com/t/axoloti-hardware/59</a></p>

<p>also be careful you don't put it into a balanced input.. otherwise L&amp;R might cancel each other out (almost) on some patches.  thats IIRC correctly... I remember doing something like this when I first got axoloti, but it was a long time ago now... so perhaps im mis-remembering <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> ... there are now 'audio config options' to resolve this , but id recommend initially just checking your cabling, so you identify the source of the issue.</p>

<p>otherwise perhaps its something with the particular patch your using?<br>perhaps check the headphone output, see if its the same.</p>

              <p>its probably sulking because you haven't been paying it enough attention <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> </p>

<p>hmmm.. odd though, theres no reason it shouldn't at least turn up as a DFU device.<br>really you need to proceed as you would with any other usb device on linux...<br>- try a different usb cable (make sure its a data cable, not just power) <br>- dont use a usb hub, try to eliminate any other possible issues<br>- check logs and device mapping using dmesg and  lsusb  , <br>- check udev rules. (though this wont stop it appearing) </p>

<p>when checking the logs, what you really want to see is if any device is being seen by linux.<br>even if a device is completely unrecognised by linux, it should still appear on the device tree and something come up in the console logs.<br>if its not, then that sounds like hardware/cables ... if something does appear sounds more like OS/firmware.</p>

<p>Id also connect it to a mac or windows machine and see if that can see it in either mode... to determine if its a hardware issue, or just your linux setup. (mac is preferable, as has less variables than windows <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ) </p>

<p>you could also try holding down S2 whilst booting to see if it then appears to work in normal mode (this prevents any auto start patch loading) , but frankly it sounds like you have a USB connection issue... either due to OS configuration or bad cable/hardware</p>

              <p>I think I am experiencing some issues related to these previous comments.  Just received my Axoloti and can not get the patcher software to work.</p>

<p>Problem : Axoloti board turns on when connected to computer.  Leds flash.  Windows installs driver and says it's ok.  When I try to run software I get "No available USB device found with matching PID/VID".</p>

<p>Things I have tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>tried 4 different usb cables, verified they are data cables.</li>
<li>tried on multiple usb ports, 4 on one computer 5 on another.</li>
<li>axoloti_runtime installed to C:\Program Files (x86)\axoloti_runtime</li>
<li>tried on 2 different Windows 7 computers.</li>
<li>in axoloti software under -&gt; Board -&gt; Axoloti Core shows up but says "not accessible, driver not installed"</li>
<li>Put board into Rescue mode by holding down s1 and plugging in.  In Zadig application chose<br>STM32 Bootloader -&gt; "Replace Driver" - &gt; error " The driver Installation failed"</li>
</ul>

<p>Not sure what else to try.  I will note that regardless of what combination of computers and cable same exact errors exist.  Seems to be a board problem?</p>
