              <p>Ok I was under the impression you already owned an Axoloti, they are pretty hard to find these days. Adding a push button and dry/wet control would be no problem though. </p>

<p>You can solder any control elements like push buttons, switches and potentiometers directly to the GPIO pins on the Axoloti board or use an external MIDI controller (much easier). Control objects in the patch like "dials" can be MIDI mapped or replaced with external signals from the GPIO pins.</p>

<p>You could also go much further in general, for example<br>- add envelope followers that control things like comb, ringmod and FM frequencies (and more potentiometers for controlling envelope depth etc.)<br>- add sequencing of FX parameters synced to MIDI clock<br>- make the comb, ringmod and FM frequency controllable by incoming MIDI notes<br>- add many more effects like delays, reverb, filters, granular stuff etc.</p>

<p>Good luck finding an Axoloti Core!</p>

<p>In the top row you can find similar controls to the Bitrman. I did include all the FX of the Bitrman, but not the ability to change the audio routing - that is feasible, but would be pretty complicated and make the patch look like a mess.</p>

<p>On the left there's an example audio source playing a small sequence, it can be disabled and your audio inputs are patched there as well. Then there's the "bitrness" section. The effects don't sound very good as they are, but you can open each subpatch by pressing "edit" and look at what's inside. Keep in mind that almost everything can be changed - the used FX objects, the parameters that are changed by knobs, the scaling of knob turns and so on. This is just meant to provide you with something to learn from while designing your own version. </p>

<p>The signal then goes into a distortion object and a compressor. I made the "compress"-knob change between dry and wet, but there would of course be many other possibilities you can tinker with. I added the phasor as the last object before the output as it was the only stereo effect.</p>

<p>As you are new to Axoloti, I highly recommend watching the tutorials <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZFghz0wd6I&amp;list=PLM0WsT_alXHF6hEiJE_-gpizK5u54M4-l" rel="nofollow noopener">Matthew Tyas made some years ago!</a> It may be good to start off by recreating an existing device like the Bitrman, but the Axoloti can do quite a bit more than one might think at first.</p>

              <p>I see, do you own an Axoloti Core an just need someone to make a patch, or are you looking for someone to build a whole hardware device that's close to the Bitrman?</p>

              <p>Quick answer without looking at what Bitrman really does: For ring modulation, you can just multiply one signal with the other using "<strong>math/*"</strong>, or a more fancy one would be "<strong>sss/dist/RingMod</strong>". Bit reduction can be done with "<strong>sptnk/effect/bitcrusher s m</strong>", sample rate reduction I'd approximate with "<strong>sptnk/effect/sample and hold</strong>". Basically just put in the name of the effect you're looking for, there are other options as well!</p>
