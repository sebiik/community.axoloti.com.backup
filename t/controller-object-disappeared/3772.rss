    <title>Controller Object disappeared</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/controller-object-disappeared/3772</link>
    <description>Hi guys,

For no particular reason, the Controller Object defined in my Preferences is now blank. 

I remember I struggled a bit on this one. 
I did finally found a pretty solid patch to manage Program Change for switching between patches back in the days (maybe in Factory patches?). But now It has gone. I can&#39;t find anything related to Controller Objects. 

Help would be appreciated.
Thanks</description>
