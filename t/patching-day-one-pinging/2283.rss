    <title>Patching Day One .. Pinging?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/patching-day-one-pinging/2283</link>
    <description>Hey

Just trying to get my feet under the table and explore the character of the sound, and also get experience with the workflow


I have many many questions, most may be covered before, but i&#39;d like to ask those i stumble across which don&#39;t seem tackled before (at least by my cursory searching)

I guess there are some fundamental things which i will get used to, but as i have established workflows i want to understand the reasoning for differences here and possibly explore workarounds

It&#39;s now evident you cannot patch a Yellow signal into Red

This would be doable in e.g. The Nord Modular or a real Modular or a soft-modular

This technique is handy to &#39;ping&#39; a filter - catching the leading edge of a pulse signal, it acts as a momentary impulse if you have a resonant filter

My experience so far with the filter resonance is that it&#39;s quite harsh, but that&#39;s maybe a reflection of other early days patching confusion and keeping gain down

Is there a sweet filter to start with to get a feel for this, and is there any reason why a Logic signal can&#39;t be abused (through choice) in this modular environment  ?

If we are stuck with the constraint, what&#39;s the most elegant way to excite a filter without a sound source as such ?</description>

              <p>okay - early days, quite a lot to adapt to and no doubt many ways to achieve the various things i want to achieve (such as losing the gate down potentially, or at least substituting in a very brief impulse for any pulse input length, but without pinging the filter twice)</p>

<p>thanks for thoughts</p>

<p>A "dirac" single-sample pulse inevitably has relatively little energy content at lower frequencies. If you need to apply gain, it is best to do that after the filter.<br>Longer pulses, like <code>pulse/d</code> can have more energy content at lower frequencies.</p>

<p>i'm not sure if you mean straight after the gate, or in place on my screen dump - i will now try the latter, the former was no use as it had no stimulating effect</p>

<p>edit:makes no difference to the 'impulse' energy - very weak - but it also (whilst in that placement order) does not obscure the gate down</p>

<p>another note: have a search on here about excution order..., its worth understanding that from the beginning, you example is probably not executing in the order you expect it too <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> <br>hint: the wires are NOT determining the order of execution, but object placement !!!</p>

<p>this works out great - it ignores the gate closing </p>

<p>ahh, hadn't found those yet, the whole new user path is a little reliant on intuitive searching in the early stages</p>

<p>that is ideal</p>

<p>I've been patching for maybe a few hours and i've lost count of the number of times i've cmd.clicked onto an empty part of the patcher to either exit or enter live mode (as you would in Max) (where you can also use cmd E coincidentally)<br>It's those level of little cumulative things i wanted to offer as suggestions  - often the tiniest things for the easily dissuaded make the difference between hanging around for the duration and giving up - i'm not the giving up type, but i do get frustrated by little things (such as the tiny startup windows for main/patch .. can these be user scaled to defaults beyond tiny?)</p>

<p>I'm also very much into establishing why things are the way they are, these moments are a reflection of understanding to a higher level - it's all too easy to ask a question and only reveal a little bit of ignorance - i'm basically cutting a few corners as a new user with lots of prior expectation, this just ups the number of 'apparent' obstacles to bypass</p>

<p>This is cool... suggestions are always useful.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>make sure you read the manual first<br><em>and if its not correct/out of date, feel free to update it</em></p></li>
<li><p>search the forum for similar topics<br>not only does it 'strengthen the request', but its likely we will have already commented on the topic.<br>(the community is blessed with having lots of new users from many backgrounds, so the feedback has been tremendous!)</p></li>
<li><p>spend some time patching<br>many things are done for a reason, that may not be obvious at first... and whilst axoloti is similar to say max/pd/g2 its not intended as a 'clone'</p></li>
</ul>

<p>also... if you make one general post, it tends not be great for a focused discussion, it'll usually end up only discussing one or two points that others have views on.</p>

<p>have you looked at the tutorials, and the help patches attached to objects? <br>there are of course gaps, but they are a good starting pointing....<br>and if you think they are missing certain aspects, we would be happy for you to contribute additional patches. (or build the 'thing' that you have in mind)</p>

<p>I have asked before, but will comment again - a new users perspective is a wonderfully unique experience, and I think it would be great contribution if new users could somehow collate 'gotchas' , unexpected things, tips, 'light bulb moments' as they embark on the journey, and then put these in the user-guide section. (not sure the best format, leave that up to the contributor)</p>

<p>I wrote alot of the initial version of the user guide, but honestly I was probably not the ideal person, I'm probably too technical, and when I did it, had already been involved (in a small part) of the coding... so didnt have fresh eyes <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> (and honestly, I've never been a good documentation writer!)<br>so there is huge scope for improvement and this is one of the reasons it was made available as a wiki so it could be edited by the community.</p>

<p>on the Elektron community, I know there are some very popular guides written by users, that are 'must reads' for newcomers - something like this for Axoloti would be excellent.<br>(the issue with forums, is even though it can be searched, the information becomes very scattered)</p>

              <p>It seems to be (partly) so. The 'resonance' of the filter is quite short-lived in relation to my 'expectation' for the desired characteristic. Especially in terms of it decaying naturally for an audible period once excited to resonance.</p>

<p>It may well be beyond the current filter. I just need to establish what's my limited understanding and what's the limit of this particular filter model</p>

<p>Even at 63.5 the filter resonates for only relatively few cycles, it's being given a temporary lift into infinite res in that example - i guess it's just the way these particular filters are which is a shame if you're chasing those west-coast vibes</p>

<blockquote><p>It's now evident you cannot patch a Yellow signal into Red</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>Yes you can, you just need to use a conv/nointerp to convert it from yellow to red. This can be used to rst an oscillator, by connecting it to a sync input on the osc, for example. I have nord G2 and Nm1 and on does you are correct you can connect them directly. But for Axoloti you need the conv/nointerp object inbetween.</p>

<p>EDIT: Ah, I see it have all ready been answered, I was on mobile before and didnt see the answers.</p>

              <p>There's a pulse/dirac object that provides an impulse and can be triggered by yellow signals. Alternatively you could use conv/interp or conv/nointerp (probably better) to go from yellow to red.</p>

<p>The reason you can't directly connect blue to red is that red (sound) is treated ad s-rate, which is 48000 cycles per second. <br>Blue (and yellow and green and pink) signals are treated at 1/16 of that speed (3000 cycles per second) instead.</p>

<p>The objects however "talk " between them at k-rate, and s-rate signals are transported from one object to another in packets (buffers), so if you directly connect blue outlet to red inlet what you're doing is feeding the red inlet with the wrong data type, which is not recognized</p>

<p>As for filters, they don't have a particular character. They're just biquad filters, really plain response</p>
