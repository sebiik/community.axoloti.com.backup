    <title>Sample manipulation patch.... help needed</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/sample-manipulation-patch-help-needed/2957</link>
    <description>Hello,

I need some help. I&#39;ve copied some existing patches from the library to create a looping, slicing, tap tempo sampler with adjustable loop length.

It records audio rather than a sample player.

So it sounds kinda cool, what&#39;s my problem?

- the loop length &quot;size&quot; is dependent on the total length of the loop. Any idea how I can get tiny sizes with bigger loops?

- whilst the random slice position is ok, i&#39;d much prefer a button the select slices as audio runs. ie if i have a 8 sec loop, pressing a slice every second would give me 8 slices. therefore, i&#39;d like to access these slices with a dial controller with a &quot;64/n slices&quot; relationship. 0-8 would play the first slice, 9-16 the second slice and so on.... basically make the thing a standalone FX rather than relying on the sequencer and reliant on the laptop

- back the random position slice... if a random value is rather large it doesn&#39;t play a sound. can you link this to the counter size of the loop? ie the max random value will marry up with the total loop length so i don&#39;t get dead spots?

              <p><a class="mention" href="/users/mwvm">@mwvm</a><br>sorry I dont really have time to answer this question properly/fully , but given no one else has jumped in...</p>

<p>ive not looked at the patch in depth but it uses tables record/play<br>so the answer to your questions really all revolve around that startpos is a float 0.0...64.00, and has 28 decimal places.<br>the best way to think of this is a %, where 64 = 100%</p>

<p>as such the play has no concept of playing a part/loop it carries on playing till stopped<br>so the patch is basically just restarting it, at an appropriate time.<br>again this is is all floats, so you should be able to go quite small.</p>

<p>what I would do, though not the easiest way... <br>is actually write a new patch, using record/play, and build it up, you can then look to this patch for inspiration.<br>the advantage is, you will have a clear idea what its trying to do, and the states its getting into.<br>in some way its harder adapting others patch (unless they are documented well... = never ) than writing you own <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>Im a bit surprised if there are not loop/slice objects in the community library, Im pretty sure a few people have been doing this.... its not super hard, but does have quite a few 'edge cases'</p>

<p>sorry cant be more help at the moment,.</p>

              <p>Sorry I can't help you. I am still getting my head around the whole Axoloti concept. Other people are however already working on similar stuff. Maybe you should have a look around and barge in there.</p>
