    <title>Issues to create an account</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/issues-to-create-an-account/4820</link>
    <description>Hi,
I had issues creating an account in this forum.
Finally it seams that it is a problem with my email account.
I had to create this fake account with a fake e-mail account to get in contact with you.

I have sent a couple of mails to johannes.taelman@gmail.com and I made a purchase, but I haven&#39;t get any mail. I don&#39;t know if you have received any of them.

How could we fix this issue?

Thanks in advance</description>
