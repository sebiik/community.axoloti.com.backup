        <p>sounds like you have tried all that possible...<br>given that your setup, is working with another axoloti and you cannot get into dfu mode  â€¦ id assume the board cannot be seen at all via usb device manager on your OS?!</p>

<p>all you can really think about is when did it stop working, and what was the last thing you did with it, then try to back track.<br>(its not going to be software,  as anything on the software side, would not stop DFU working)</p>

<p>if you cant think of anything, then all I can think of is starting to remove the things soldered to the GPIO, perhaps they are doing something? hopefully haven't caused any damage. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/frowningae52.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> </p>

<p>apart from that you can PM <a class="mention" href="../../u/johannes.html">@johannes</a> and see if he can help you diagnose whats happened with the board.</p>

        <p>Hey ,<br>me to, nothing works. <br>Apparently several owners of the Axoloti have these problems.<br>Can it be a design flaw? I think I'll send my axoloti back.<br>This thing is only 7 months old. There must be something with a guarantee.<br>best regards tangram</p>

<blockquote><p>Apparently several owners of the Axoloti have these problems.<br>Can it be a design flaw?</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>I think we should not be jumping to conclusions, its not helpful for anyone.</p>

<p>yes, a handful of users have experienced problems, but this has to be compared to hundreds that have had Axoloti for years, without any issue.  (unfortunately there is always a bias of problems vs happy users on product forums, tis the nature of the beast) </p>

<p>to counter, Ive got four axoloti about 3 years (from the original crowdfunding campaign), so the oldest production ones out there, and all four are perfectly fine, never had any issues with them.<br>(and you'll find lots of other regular users here too, who have not reported issues)</p>

<p>Id say, given the time, and number of boards shipped,  the axoloti design has proven itself.</p>

<hr>

<p>that is <strong>not</strong> to dismiss problem, (no-one likes their board failing, even if everyone else is ok!)</p>

<p>of course, as with all electronics, things can happen that cause circuits to fail, or perhaps a bad batch of manufacturing, but speculation doesn't really help anyone.</p>

<p>what I think is important is the way its handled... and we know <a class="mention" href="../../u/johannes.html">@johannes</a> takes this seriously. <br>(example: look at his report about the v1.0 boards, where some usb devices were causing issues, he was not only very thorough, but very open with the information about what was happening) </p>

<p>as end-users, we of course don't get to see the full picture, unlike <a class="mention" href="../../u/johannes.html">@johannes</a></p>

<p>but we do know <a class="mention" href="../../u/johannes.html">@johannes</a> gets to see all faulty/returned boards, so he can check them to see what caused the fault - manufacturing? user connected devices? over voltage?  thats the advantage of a one man company, he designed the board, when boards are returned, he has the skills to determine the failure. his means that if there were a design issue he could (and would) remedy it, similarly if there was a manufacturing issue, he would be able to resolve/chase this up.</p>

<hr>

<p>so this goes back to what I say when these faults are raised.</p>

<p>a) check its not something at the user end - cables, software, connected devices.</p>

<p>b) if that does not resolve the issue, contact <a class="mention" href="../../u/johannes.html">@johannes</a> (via PM) , where he can see help determine the cause, and if it can be resolved without returning the board.<br>if not he will make arrangements with the owner about what to do next, based on what the issue appears to be.</p>

<p>I as a user/community member just help on (a) , to try to help reduce the number that go to step (b), to help reduce Johannes workload a little bit... as he is very busy with support/production/development. </p>

<p>so if you have issues, and have gone from step (a), Id urge you to contact Johannes.</p>

<p>good luck getting your issue resolved.<br>Mark</p>
