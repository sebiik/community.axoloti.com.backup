    <title>A question about order of execution when coding objects!</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/a-question-about-order-of-execution-when-coding-objects/3463</link>
    <description>Hey!

Trying to code a filter here, where the order of execution is very important. Actually I want to process the code in the object **NOT** in the right order. But it seems like I cant get it right. See picture:

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/c/ceead7c68896cbb263a9ab81600a6fbd3104e652.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;372&quot;&gt;

The first line named GOOOD processes the math/+ before everything else......... and this sound best for this occasion, so this is what I am trying to do.

The second line BAAAAD has &quot;right&quot; order of execution, but it doesnt sound as good.

Question is, how do I make sure the code ins processed in the right sequence, with the math/+ being processed first? I tried a few times but I think I dont understand order of execution in code yet. I made an example patch and my test object is included, if someone wouldn&#39;t mind taking a look at, I would appreciate it.

Jaffa

<p>Yes, this is how I understand it. I think I said that when I have everything within one object, the k-rate code of the individual filter are processed together, before the S-rate code is processed.</p>

<p>And when patched with factory objects it processes the whole object, k-rate &amp; s-rate before processing the next objects. </p>

<p>So there is a difference there. But I dont know if this is the reason.<br></p>

<p>I am trying to do what is described as GOOOD path, where the math/+ is processed first and then the rest. If what you say is the technical way of saying it, then yes.</p>

<p>So a way to do this could be adding a 1 sample delay to the filters, so math/+ is processed first and then the filters?</p>

<p>It seems pretty clear that it doesnt process it the way I was hoping for. So not so much a problem IF it processes it wrongly(according to what my goal is) it, more about what a solution to the problem could be.</p>

              <p>I think I all ready did that. This is supposed to be the GOOOD version, but it sounds the same as the BAAAAD version:<br><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/2/291fa9fb2994bc226dd5e626a6365968837b43e0.png" width="362" height="294"></p>

<p>The 2 filters has got some code in the k-rate section, which is as far as i know processed before sample rate section. So I am thinking there might be a problem there. Cause when patched with factory objects, it processed every filter individually before sending it to the next. When having all the code in one object, this changes a bit and both filter K-rate code are processed at the same time and then s-rate code. So it becomes kind of parallel, not 100% serial, like when using factory objects. Dunno if this actually matters...</p>

<p>Anyway, the above doesnt work.</p>
