    <title>Splitting the Stereo Input and Output</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/splitting-the-stereo-input-and-output/1488</link>
    <description>Hello!

I just received my Axoloti today and want to make sure that I understand the stereo input and output. I plan on using the Axoloti to process a guitar signal and to my understanding I need to split the input and output signals into mono. 

Would something like this work for that? And then I can use standard guitar cables for the in and out?

Also I have experience programming in c and assembly and I am wondering if it is possible to program the Axoloti directly.

Sorry if these topics have already been covered, I searched around but was unable to find any definitive answers.

Thank you!</description>

<p>Axoloti is fully programmable in C and assembly at the patch level. You can open the definition of any object in the patch editor and edit its code, and you can make your own ones too of course. The compiler is included and the build is automated so that all you have to do is write the code and click a button to compile and start the patch. It's all open source, the firmware written in C and assembly and so that's fully hackable too. Axoloti is a most excellent playground for C/assembly audio programmers <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
