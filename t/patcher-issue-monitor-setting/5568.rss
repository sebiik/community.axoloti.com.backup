    <title>Patcher Issue (monitor setting)</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/patcher-issue-monitor-setting/5568</link>
    <description>Hello, 

I discovered a strange behaviour while shareing a Patch wit a lot of Patcher-Objects included.
Usually I am using two monitors when I am working with the Axoloi-Patcher. On the first I&#39;ve the main patch, on the second i m editing the patcher objects.

Now I discovered after sharing the patches, that this monitor setting is also stored in the axo file, with the effect  that if someone using a different monitor - setting (a single) the sub-patches will be empty or not open (or outside of the visible area)

I this a known issue?
