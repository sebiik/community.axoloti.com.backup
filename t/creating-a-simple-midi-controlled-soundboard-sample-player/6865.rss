    <title>Creating a simple MIDI controlled soundboard / sample player</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/creating-a-simple-midi-controlled-soundboard-sample-player/6865</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking to use an Axoloti Core as a simple soundboard to play audio files from the sd card that is triggered by an external MIDI pad controller. 

I&#39;ve successfully created a patch that plays a specific sample when a specific MIDI note is played. A tap of a pad triggers the sample and it plays to completion. The pad controller has 16 pads. Pads 1-15 have their MIDI notes mapped to specific samples and pad 16 has a MIDI note that stops any playing samples.
 
This achieves my main goal, but I&#39;m attempting to add a new feature to it:

By design the patch is monophonic. Currently when I trigger a sample and trigger another sample while the first one is playing, the gate from the second MIDI note triggers a STOP on the first sample. This works, but I&#39;d prefer to be able to cross-fade between samples with a specific duration if possible rather than hard-cutting between them. 

Also, to get a MIDI note to trigger a start a sample and stop any other playing samples, I had to build a pretty big rats nest of patch cords. Is there a more graceful way to do this via an object of some sort?</description>

              <p>Hi,<br>maybe out of topic, but is it possible later to modify the sample pitch, stretch it in time, change the start and stop points on the fly, or you need to do this in an external sound editor before loading to axoloti?</p>

<p>MIDI note 63 is serving as the "kill" note that stops any playing samples. MIDI notes 64-67 each start their own sample and kill any already playing sample.</p>

<p>To achieve the crossfade thing you might have to put parts of this into a subpatch and duplicate it, then have the "logic/change" object trigger an envelope into an xfade - but then there will probably issues with playback stopping? </p>

<p>How does your patch look right now?</p>
