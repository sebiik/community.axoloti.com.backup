    <description>Hey, Yesterday i use my midi controller (launch control XL) , it work fines. But now, when i plug it, the axolot statut is &quot;looping&quot; in the statut Connect/disconnect/connect/disconnet etc.. 
The error message is :

:slight_smile:
  java.lang.InterruptedException
java.lang.InterruptedException

<p>So one writes from the midi controller to the table. In this case it turns all the buttons into toggles.<br>And the other is sending from the table to the midi controller.</p>

<p>Its far more efficient as you only send the values that change. Like this you will have far less midi traffic and thus no buffer overrun and these kinds of problems.</p>

<p>p.s. this works best when you put your buttons in a chromatic order. I did that on the user mode of the launch controllers. Otherwise you will have to hack into the code and remap the values.</p>

              <p>The way I update the LED's id actually by suggestion from you <a class="mention" href="/u/blindsmyth">@Blindsmyth</a>.</p>

<p>I use an lfo to trigger the midi out send to my midi controller. Then I use a counter triggered by the same lfo to run through the table that holds the values for the steps.</p>

<p>It's fairly simple and not updated a lot, update speed is set by the lfo and I do not set the lfo too fast, but also not too low, just in the middle so it doesn't lag.</p>

<p>the attribute 'holdmap' could be any other table,<br>I think it has to have minimum 128 elements though.</p>

<p>How do you update your leds? I can really recomend usign the objects by <a class="mention" href="/u/rbrt">@rbrt</a> table send note / table send cc. I don't have this ringbuffer thing.</p>

<p>As the author of the thread indicates here also using a usb hub can cause problems!</p>

<p>And yeah it's that inconsistency that's really hard to figure out and work with.</p>

<p>One day I can have it connected and it works okay for a few hours. Next days I get error and disconnects en masse. And I have tried several different Macbooks, with same result, trying to rule out other variables. I tested the controllers with other devices and works fine. But with axo, it just drives me nuts, cause it's so inconsistant.</p>

<p>So it's very frustrating.</p>

<p>And yeah, it doesn't like data too fast, but I can still send it fast enough that it looks as though every led lights instantly, so not really a problem for me. For example, rbrt's launchpad object can light the mini's grid with no issues, instantly. I wonder if its simply the speed causing the issues and it depends on how the objects being used were coded. Or maybe a power thing?</p>

<p>Fwiw, I have my axo's powered by the dc barrel sockets, connected to an unpowered usb hub to Windows for patching (no usb device midi going on). Could it be something to do with usb device midi? Just throwing out ideas in case they help.</p>

<p>Something I had forgotten about - at one point I was forwarding launch control xl midi through the din and if i moved more than one fader really quickly it would crash. I used a thinning object to forward the midi and the problem went away. </p>

<p>Do you have crashes on every patch or is it only on some, or totally random? Does it crash on an empty patch?</p>

<p>The launch control xl has caused crashes before, but it's been when I've been fiddling with code... The patch I use it with at the moment never crashes. Just using it for knob/fader input and send some messages for lights back. It doesn't seem to like too much data being sent to it. I'm forwarding midi through the din. A few people on the forum have had problems though.</p>

<p>Launchpad pro has been fine, but just lately I've had a few crashes with a new patch (not with patcher running) where the patch is still running but the pro's leds go dark and it stops sending midi until I restart the launchpad (patch is still running). But I've been coding objects for it and I'm no coder, so it might be that.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what causes the problems, apart from data being sent too fast to the controller.</p>

              <p>Welcome to the world of Axolotis midi implementation.</p>

<p>I have like 4 midi controllers from Launch series. Ans I have problems with ALL of them when I use them with Axoloti. I also use them with Pure Data and have absolutely no issue there, so I know it's not the controllers.</p>

<p>Sometimes they work a little bit and they next day they disconnect all the time, giving midi ringbuffer overflows, disconnects and what have we.</p>

<p>I think Axolotis midi code needs an update, it's not "safe" enough.</p>
