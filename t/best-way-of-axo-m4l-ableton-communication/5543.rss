    <title>Best way of AXO &lt;&gt; M4L / Ableton communication?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/best-way-of-axo-m4l-ableton-communication/5543</link>
    <description>Hey i only got my first axo on the way, but i am wondering about the best way to make it speak to ableton? obviously m4l plguins would have to be written, but i&#39;m not even sure what protocol or interface would be most suitable.

my main goal is to transmit both midi and text/led/data both ways, for example i am thinking about using the axo to build a sophisticated ableton controller with OLED screens displaying ableton macros etc. so i need text and data to go from ableton/m4l to the axo.

i guess that kinda eliminates midi as the protocol, i feel sysex etc would be too slow to transmit all that in timing? is there any faster usb host standards maybe both the axo and m4l would supply? anybody worked on implementing OSC in axo?

also all this would probably be easier just using an arduino since there are tons of m4l resources for it, but i want to avoid the hassle of building a whole arduino thing with shields, way more coding, machine stuff etc etc., what i love so much about the idea of the axo is the level of convenience it has while remaining all the flexibility.

so yeah. anybody looked into this or has any idea?
i also found an older thread inquiring axo&lt;&gt;ableton link options, anybody has news on that maybe?

thanks.</description>
