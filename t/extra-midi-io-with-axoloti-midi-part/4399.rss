    <title>Extra Midi IO with Axoloti Midi Part</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/extra-midi-io-with-axoloti-midi-part/4399</link>
    <description>He there, I want to get @Hugo&#39;s extra midi input IO with onboard hardware.

I use the boards genuine midi IO already for talking with another board, so I want to get use PA2 and PA3 together with Hugo&#39;S script for talking with the outside/nonaxoloti world.

The output works, connecting PA2 to &quot;Midi Out&quot;.
 &lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c92e43e26f8e787c6321020e1dacfabaccd9b95a.png&quot; width=&quot;367&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;

The same didn&#39;t work for PA3, conencting it to &quot;Midi In&quot; 
I tried both sending midi from my soundcard (tested and working with volca sample) to the axoloti midi part and connecting axoloti&#39;s &quot;midi out&quot; as on the pic to PA3. No midi arriving though!

Sending Midi from PA2 to PA3 worked well. So what am I doing wrong here?</description>

              <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/hugo">@Hugo</a>,<br>I am very interested in sorting the issue, my work around was to connect the serial line directly to the MIDI in DIN o the Axo.<br>So my setup is that I have a menu patch just for connecting to other patches.<br>When setup via UART, if I start in the menu patch, the link works, the moment I go into a sound patch, it stops working, and vice versa, If I start in a sound patch it works, the moment I go into the menu patch it stops working.<br>I did as much testing as I could to try and work out where the problem is, my understanding of the midi code in the Axo is a little limited, so I kept this testing basic, but from the midi source, I am sending the serial data from Arduino Due using the "fortyseveneffects" library, and I was very thorough in this testing, what was happening, is the midi data was being sent, but was not being processed when it arrived.<br>The serial input on the Axo works fine, even testing with the serial factory patch all worked perfectly. It all works perfectly connected directly to the axo midi in din.<br>So based on all this testing, I can only guess with my limited experience, it is somewhere that maybe missing a startup routine when opening a patch in standalone mode that is preventing the midi from flowing through, maybe even something happening to the serial pin itself. But one downside, is I won't be in a position to test it for at least a few weeks, because I am working on another section of the project, and so my standalone setup to test is currently out of action.<br>But any thoughts you may have on the problem will be great.<br><img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>As far as I know the gpios of microcontrollers in the 80s didnt have enough power to transmit the signal on it's own, which is why they added the vbus line and then propably the optocoppler to isolate receiver and transmitter from each other. <br>But today this is not an issue, so when connecting two axos, or and axoloti and a teensy and everthing is on the same voltage range it should fine to just go from rx to tx. <br>I think even Johannes told me If I connect 2 axos via midi I can avoid the "classic" midi circuitry.</p>

<p>I don't change patches atm, so that's not an issue. And If want to do so I would have 2-3 patches max, so I could just load different patches to sd cards.</p>

<p>I would rather need a midi merge. Midi out via PA2 --&gt; axoloti midi out worked fine. <br>USB hub support would so much simplify all these things. You could for example add usb midi interfaces, have one axoloti host the other + use your favorite usb midi controllers. </p>

<p>But the point is eventually: I don't use axolotis midi circuitry how can I use the midi input part with PA3 to receive midi?</p>

<p>Ok thanks for pointing this out. The midi part of axoloti is working perfectly fine. The point is I do avoid the optocopler already by going from "MIDI IN" to "MIDI OUT" as on the schematic in the first post and vice versa between 2 axoloti boards. Aparently more people on the board are doing it like this, but do you think this is dangerous as well?</p>

<p>Then since I don't use the midi io hardware part I want to use it together with pin PA2 and PA3 to get extra Midi IO. <br>While sending midi from PA2 via axoloti midi out works, midi in didn't, or it only worked when hooking pin MI5 to PA3 directly.</p>

<p>I made a cut where you would usually break the midi part so between "JP2" and "JP3"</p>

<p>So I got it to work but only by tapping from Mi5 directly.</p>

<p>When I tap from after the optocopler I still get nothing. Is this ok? I receive Midi from my volca sample. Are there any risks avoiding the optocopler like this? More likely to have ground loops maybe?</p>

<p>Btw I cut the Midi in out and out lines as in the pic from the first post.</p>

              <p>He there, I want to get <a class="mention" href="/u/hugo">@Hugo</a>'s extra midi input IO with onboard hardware.</p>

<p>I use the boards genuine midi IO already for talking with another board, so I want to get use PA2 and PA3 together with Hugo'S script for talking with the outside/nonaxoloti world.</p>

<p>The output works, connecting PA2 to "Midi Out".<br> <div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/c92e43e26f8e787c6321020e1dacfabaccd9b95a" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c92e43e26f8e787c6321020e1dacfabaccd9b95a.png" class="lightbox" title="Midi Part.png"><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c92e43e26f8e787c6321020e1dacfabaccd9b95a_1_367x500.png" width="367" height="500"><div class="meta">

<p>The same didn't work for PA3, conencting it to "Midi In" <br>I tried both sending midi from my soundcard (tested and working with volca sample) to the axoloti midi part and connecting axoloti's "midi out" as on the pic to PA3. No midi arriving though!</p>

<p>Sending Midi from PA2 to PA3 worked well. So what am I doing wrong here?</p>
