    <description>2015 was extremely fun and educational in large thanks to Axoloti landing into my home. I can&#39;t thank Johannes and his crew and this community for the joy! I wish for the project to grow in the new year and for us all to stay inspired! Have a happy new revolution!</description>

              <p>I was just extrapolating, I'm sure Johannes has enough to do with the software side of Axoloti for the moment, and even I think an extra year or two to explore the first version won't be too much. But I really wish this platform works well enough to see future versions as we get older (no too long, I'm already getting blind and trembling a bit too much)</p>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/users/alexk">@alexk</a>  I'm 100% with you </p>

<p>I would also like to thank Johannes and the team for making 2015 one of the most exciting years, sound wise.</p>

<p>I would also like to use this thread to do my quick recap of 2015, axoloti related</p>

<p><strong>Beginning 2015</strong> : I ordered 2 axoloti's from the indigogo campaign<br><strong>mid-August</strong> : received my axoloti's and decided to offer one to a friend<br><strong>end-August</strong> : had already played a few gigs with the axoloti as main sound source<br><strong>September / October :</strong> made my first axoloti box and made the "in the wood videos"<br><strong>November :</strong> ordered two more axoloti's as they are now available for anyone. <br>Recorded the "Laws of Freedom" project using the axoloti quite a bit, with the same friend that I gave the axoloti to. He announces that he can't make the axoloti software work on his old apple computer (32bit OSX), and gives me back the axoloti. He then playes with my box and asks me to make him one.<br><strong>December :</strong> made my 2nd axoloti box (for my friend), with a teensy board connected by midi USB for more knobs and 6 complex predefined patches (waiting for him to save money for a new computer)</p>

<p>edit: funny enough, my instagram feed illustrates those last months rather well : <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mtyas/" rel="nofollow">https://www.instagram.com/mtyas/</a> </p>

<p> Now here are my 2016 projections concerning Axoloti</p>

<p><strong>January :</strong> Make my Box number 3, I've already drawn the plans, just need a few more bits. Play around with connecting box 1 and 3 together</p>

<p><strong>Febuary :</strong> learn the best ways to do multiplexing for getting the maximum amount of analog inputs and outputs for my box number 4</p>

<p><strong>mars :</strong> Decide at last to test multiplexing, and find out that 64 pots, 64 stereo input jacks, 16 leds, 80 resistors, make a hell of a lot of soldering points to do this with simple wires.</p>

<p><strong>April :</strong> Hang around the local Fablab to see if they can be of any help in making a custom PCB for me.</p>

<p><strong>Mai :</strong> Do my own PCB with a few prototype boards and at last get the mega-monster box 4 finished</p>

<p><strong>June :</strong> Get kicked out by all the wild animals that live near me, for making too many strange noises. </p>

<p><strong>July :</strong> Read that Johannes is working on the Axoloti 2.0 board, with extra audio input/outputs, more memory, faster chip and 64 input/output soldering points</p>

<p><strong>August :</strong> need money, too hot to find a job, drink cheap beer</p>

<p><strong>September :</strong> pre-order the new board that Johannes manages to sell for the same price as v1.0</p>

<p><strong>October - November - December:</strong> Do the same things as in 2015</p>

<p>And this is just hardware related, I could think up a million software related wishes</p>

<p>anyway, enough of this skiving off real human interactions around the house, lets go and play with box #2 before I give it to it's owner</p>

<p>All the best for the last moments of 2015</p>
