        <p>Better using linear sine oscillators and tuning them with mtof + constant offset value.<br>The reason i say this is because the frequency of beating (for two sinewaves) is given by the difference of the frequencies (f1-f2).<br>So, if you have a constant frequency (not pitch!) offset between the two signals, no matter how they're tuned they will beat always at the same frequency:</p>

<p>This phenomenon is best known in acoustics or music, though it can be found in any linear system: "According to the law of superposition, two tones sounding simultaneously are superimposed in a very simple way: one adds their amplitudes". If a graph is drawn to show the function corresponding to the total sound of two strings, it can be seen that maxima and minima are no longer constant as when a pure note is played, but change over time: when the two waves are nearly 180 degrees out of phase  It...</p>

        <p>Looks ok to me, maybe you can switch in1 and in2 to get a positive reading on the display. If you want higher precision you can edit the display and add a couple of zeroes (2 or 3) to the number in k-rate (you will see the frequency multiplyed by 100 if you add 2 zeroes. So a reading of 613 will mean 6.13 Hz) <br>If you want to see beatings, however, you'll have to mix the signals together. With your setup you're just sending two detuned sines hard panned to output</p>

<p>well thats why its called Binaural, <br>you should use a headphone to generate the binaural frequency inside your skull....<br>if you have Epilepsy or had a Stroke ...DONT DO IT !!!!<br></p>

<blockquote><p>This is escpecially funky because Scientists dont believe in Binaural beats, ...</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>generally speaking scientists "think" and do not "believe".<br>Methodical doubt is the key to science.<br>Checking and counter checking facts is a slow and tedious process. but as far as i know it is the only way to avoid superstition...<br>Very superstitious ain't the way.</p>

<p>As far as epilepsy is concerned... the brain works asynchronously. synchronicity leads to epilepsy episodes. Cyclic stimuli can be the cause of this synchronisation. </p>

<p>I'm not sure that everybody is sensitive to the same frequencies.</p>

<p>Every brain is unique and is patched in a different way.</p>

<p>Imagine different reverb patches, each with different delays, all pass filters and feedbacks.</p>

<p>Each one will have a different response to stimuli. Longer delays, brighter sound...<br>But, poorly designed reverb patches will have some <strong>ringing</strong> effects at certain <strong>frequencies</strong>... epileptic reverbs !</p>

<p>I think that its quite similar to what can happen in a brain. I don't believe that there is a "magical" frequency or waveform or stimulus for all the different brains.</p>

<hr>

<p>The scientific, the artistic and the engineering ways of thinking - and working - are not antagonistic.<br>They are complementary. They form a sort of creative circle.</p>

<p>Yeah thats why ...do you know these led neurofeedback led glasses?<br>They come with a warning not for Epilepsy ,,,<br>I saw one Person without history of Epilepsy ...and she had serious seizures after usage.</p>

<p>Besonders riskant sind abwechselnd helle und dunkle oder rot-grüne Motive in Streifen oder Rasterform, wenn sie mit Frequenzen zwischen 15-20 Hz auf den Bildschirm projiziert werden und dabei noch das gesamte Gesichtsfeld ausfüllen",</p>

<p>So at least for visuals ..there is a frequency range for Triggers  15-20 Hz<br>But there are cases of musical triggers too..</p>

<p>We underestimate the Power of Frequencies..</p>

<p>If they can lead to seizures or strokes they must be powerfull!!</p>

<p>Where was that  Methodical doubt when scientifics invented nuclear energie,and all sorts of chemicals, where was it as they created Prozac,? <br>Thank you very much science, for raving my planet, and my people .<br>I love Music thats all....   i will play on my mahagony acoustic guitar now for world peace .... and its tuned to 432 Hz    <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/grin.png?v=3" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:">   </p>

<p>That's why citizens must have a scientific education to be able to contest and boycott.</p>

        <p>My own experience is potentialy related wether or not anyone else has experienced this before I do not know....</p>

<p>Half my life time ago, I used to goto alot of "dance parties", that at the time were also known as "raves" or "warehouse parties", anyhow there was only ever one style of song that worried me, and it was a time when my beating heart seamed to be in sequence with the rythm of the peice, then slowly the rythm would slow down, giving the sensation that the heart beat was doing the same thing, and wether it was or not is irelevant, what was important is what it made think was happening.</p>

<p>With this experience I strongly believe the effect of what certain frequencies can do is not real, but what they can make you think is happening can be far more dangerous. ! Especialy if you are unwell and or somewhat medicated.</p>

<p>Its like the so called "Brown Note" the frequency that makes you poo your pance. Its now proven its not real.</p>

<p>But what we do know, is the power of the mind can be made to believe anything making not just mental changes, but physical as well. "Thankyou Darrin Brown for showing me this."<br><img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/grin.png?v=3" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>

<p>It is all in the mind.. !!</p>

<p>If you dance to a faster paced tempo it's obvious that your heart will beat faster, as it will have to pump more blood to let you dance and jump faster... <br>Also in rave parties there are a lot of other factors concurring to make you feel unusual sensations <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/grin.png?v=3" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>

<p>Also, neural oscillations are a thing in neuroscience, you can detect them fairly easily (there's also an italian company that makes an eurorack compatible brainwave detector: <a href="http://www.sound-machines.it/product/bi1brainterface-neurorack/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.sound-machines.it/product/bi1brainterface-neurorack/</a> )</p>

<p>The problem with this is that ignorant people (meaning that they ignore), tend to give very personal interpretations to science facts. As far as i know, the whole binaural beats think skyrocketed when some clever guy marketed idoser as the digital alternative to drugs. He placed some science fact here and there to justify its product (which was cheap, also). People believed it and he made money. Placebo effect made everything else possible (including positive reviews)</p>

<p>When scientist harnessed (they did not invent it) nuclear power, they had a solid theory background pointing in that direction. It was certainly not because some guy misinterpreted a physics paper.<br>As for chemistry maybe things are a bit different. Many chemicals were discovered by chance, true, but do you know how many experiments they had to make before getting to the lucky one?</p>

<p>Maybe, it depends on the strength of the vibration.<br>I don't know if the <a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/zaron-burnett-iii/2014/02/how-nikola-tesla-made-mark-twain-crap-his-white-suit-and-how-we-can-avoid-the-same-fate/">Tesla / Twain</a> prank is real.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the novel "we can build you" PK. Dick tells about electronic organ manufacturers with advanced technology that directly projects emotions into the human brain with electrodes.<br>Thanks to the diversity of brain configurations i think it is not possible in a standard and massive way.</p>

        <p>I have no doubt audio signals can have profound impacts, but it is different for everyone. No sound makes me happier then experiencing a 23 minute live perofrmance of "You make me realize" by "My Bloody Valentine", but this is just me, and something in me that connects to this. </p>

<p>I am sure we all believe that sound is capable of some real amazing things otherwise it would be difficult to explain why we are involved in this wonderfull Axoloti environment. But everyones goals are different because we all are wired a little differently with strengths and weaknesses that can be manipulated very well if you know what you are doing.</p>

<p>Yes we need to be mindful of those with epilepsy, its a horrible disorder, and we need to protect the pregnant, young and ealderly from the experiments.</p>

<p>There are people already out there who know how to take advantage of the mind, in fact Darren Brown shows how a random citezen can be hypnotized without even knowing its happening, and then commit a crime. It is the power of the mind and there are people out there that know how to take advantage of it all ready.</p>

<p>I know the post is somewhat going off topic, but it is a very interesting debate, definately areas with lots of room to experiment. Music and sound will always have room to question such, in history we had the "devils tritone" people were killed for using it. Because it invoked tones that were at the time considered unpleasant. Then we have the scales and cords themselves, the blues is played with certain notes to invoke a certain tone in the music. This may be considered different to the idea of dangerous freq, but I don't think it is. Christain Evangilists have musical specialists use songs with certain beat patterns, certain tones that change throughout the event that change the viewers activity, pace of the heart beat, to simulate a form of exhaustion, so that towards the end very specific musical tones are used so that the combination of the veiwers physical state combined with their desire to experience something spiritual is almost garaunteed. These techinques are very well documented in psychiatry and are used to manipulate us.</p>

<p>Once again, its all about the power of the mind, given the right environment we can believe anything is happening to us. <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/grin.png?v=3" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>
