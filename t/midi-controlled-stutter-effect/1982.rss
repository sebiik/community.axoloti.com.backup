    <title>MIDI controlled Stutter Effect</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/midi-controlled-stutter-effect/1982</link>
    <description>Hey Axoloti Community,

you&#39;ve helped me before and I&#39;d be glad to let myself be helped once again (if this sentence doesn&#39;t make sense = not my native language ;-)).

I really, really want to create a stutter effect for guitar and maybe voice and maybe synth as well. I just can&#39;t wrap my head around this whole Axoloti MIDI topic. I managed to make my guitar stutter, but how to go further about this.

First off I want to set a BPM tempo, then I just want to hit a chord, press a button/pedal that sends MIDI CC into the DIN port of the Axoloti, which starts the stutter. Depending on the MIDI CC value the Axoloti should cut the signal into 1/4, 1/6, 1/8, 1/12, 1/16 notes - you get the idea.

That&#39;s how far I&#39;ve come...

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1ebfeba50b23f528e4bb8f72e367916fc24ede06.JPG&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;210&quot;&gt;

So there needs to be some logics between the divremc and the LFO. I added the muls 256 for accuracy, I&#39;m sure there is a better way to accomplish that.

I don&#39;t even know where to start and what the missing parts of the patch would look like. I hope you can help me. I&#39;m still a beginner with the Axoloti and barely have time besides work and making music. But the Axoloti is simply everything I looked for concerning programmability (if that word exists). It manages to bring me hours of joy, even rivaling with an Access Virus I bought a few weeks ago, when I&#39;m deciding what to do with my few hours every week. And it&#39;s holding up well! ;-)

Thanks in advance, Axolotists (?)</description>

              <p>Tap Tempo wasn't something I even dared dreaming of. I already noticed before, that a lot of your stuff makes Axoloti users life easier, especially for people who just don't have as much time to get into the coding aspects of the Axoloti. So in case you haven't heard it enough already: REAL BIG THANK YOU for all your contribution. I'll make sure to present whatever comes out of my helpless experiments. <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=2" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>the latest lfo I made is a tempo-synced LFO... you can use an external midi clock to sync it to host tempo or just tap a tempo. Rate will update after each hit (only 2 presses needed to set a tempo).<br>I think it will work a lot better than the routing I see here... especially as you're using a log pitch input overhere...<br>Also, my multiLFO has a direct 1hz/v input, so you can set you BPM pretty easily if you want to do that with a knob.</p>

<p>In my "timers" folder, I got a clock2timing module which automatically calculates the delay settings and hz settings.<br>The basedelay is the delaytime directly related to the incoming clock, which you can then divide or multiply with my "maxrateVCA" module (maths folder, connect it's max input to the max output on the clock2timing module)</p>
