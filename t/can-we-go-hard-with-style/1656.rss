    <title>Can we go hard with style? :)</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/can-we-go-hard-with-style/1656</link>
    <description>i am currently working on a synth project, namely putting an axoloti synth in a nectar impact ix61 keyboard, the synth so far is mostly done, and here is a demo video of it in action: 

https://youtu.be/SnONwqoMsOk

the only problem i have now is to get the maxtrix layout of the keys right... :confused: 

anyone has a pinout for that specific keyboard? (nektar ix61)
i also contacted their support if they are willing to help me out. (they won&#39;t help me sadly)

anyhow,
current features of the patch:
each voice (5 voices):
- 1 supersquare (7 square osc) with detune amount and mix
- 2 supersaws (one of them is 1 octave higher)
- lowpass filter with adsr
- highpass filter with keytracking
- velocity sensitive input

1 global lfo on the voices&#39; pitch input

4 band equalizer 

mono delay with filter

simple reverb (thanks mtyas!) with a added low/highpass filter

compressor to prevent output overload

update on last edit (may 11 2016)
https://soundcloud.com/da_detuner/melodies

only applied a noise cancellation, see track details for the reason.

current DSP load: ~94%
current RAM usage: ~90%</description>

              <p>i don't know yet, maybe i will~</p>

<p>also, update on the keyboard pin mappings, i received this message back from the company:</p>

<p>We don't support modification like what you have described. <br>I'm sorry but I cant give any information about how to do the modification you are wanting.<br>All the best.</p>

<p>which leaves me with myself, or perhaps others who want to help with a keyboard pin mapping?</p>
