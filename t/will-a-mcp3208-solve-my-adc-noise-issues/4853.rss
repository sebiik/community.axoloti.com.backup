    <title>Will a MCP3208 solve my ADC noise issues?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/will-a-mcp3208-solve-my-adc-noise-issues/4853</link>
    <description>Hi everybody!

First post here, been using my axoloti for a couple of years now, mostly as a synth engine controlled by midicontrollers, etc.

I just started patching and prototyping a delay/karplus-strong eurorack-module using the Axoloti and I&#39;m running into some issues, since there is way too much noise/jitter on my ADC readings for this kind of application (Voltage control over the &quot;pitch&quot; (delaytime) of the KS). 
From what i could tell by searching this forum, others are having the same issues. 
(I don&#39;t have the CV-Inputs hooked up yet, just using 25Kb potentiometers with 10nF between wiper and GND for now, btw.)

For any of you who have worked with the MCP3208: How much noise/jitter can i expect, will it be a significant improvement over the Axolotis ADC?

thanks!

              <p>Well, here is a short update for anyone interested:</p>

<p>I got me some mcp3008s, which is the same as the 3208 except only 10bit resolution, as that's all my local electronics place had in stock. Definitely a huge improvement over the internal ADC, highly recommended!</p>

<p>I used a socket for the mcp3008 so i can just drop in the 3208 that i ordered by now. 10 bit resolution is fine for coarse delaytime, feedback, etc., but for a V/Oct-scaled input, 12-bit ADC might come in handy.</p>
