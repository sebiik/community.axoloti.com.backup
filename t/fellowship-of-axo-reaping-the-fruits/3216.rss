    <description>Fellowship of Axo - 2 of 2
===

This is the second part of the Fellowship of Axo challenge.

In this part we take &#39;seeds&#39; from part one of this challenge , and tend and nurture them, and the reap the fruits ... or in plain speak simply take one or more seeds from [Seeds of inspiration](https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/fellowship-of-axo-seeds-of-inspiration-challenge) and use it as inspiration for a track :) 


**submission date : open ended, feel free to pick a seed and develop it, and put the post the results here.** 


Restrictions
---
only rule is you have to use at least one seed, detail here which seed(s) you used.

apart from that no rules. you can use the seed &#39;as is&#39; ,or mangle/edit/change the seed beyond the point of recognition. you can use whatever you want to produce the track, e.g. daws/synths/fx - as long as Axoloti plays some part in the track.

Submissions
---
post entries in this thread - either as soundcloud or youtube links.
include a reference to the seed(s) you used in the track

**note:** it looks like everyone is busy, so Ive decided to make this an &#39;open ended&#39; challenge, with no end date, so you are free to add new seeds or new fruits at any time. the more seeds added, the more fruit we can grow :slight_smile:</description>
