    <description>Hi! 

Is there a way to record the axoloti live patch without an SD card? 
I want to take what i made in the patch and have what is played put it into a track in a DAW (logic/ableton/etc) but I&#39;m working without an SD card...</description>

              <p>bit confused...  do it as you would any synth,<br>take your audio output (jack) from axoloti and plug into your computer via an audio interface, then record in the daw.</p>

<p>its that of use some kind of digital recorder, I recently got a zoom at that's great, not only can record to sdcard but also can act as an audio interface as well... perfect for a portable setup.</p>
