    <title>AE Modular with axoloti</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/ae-modular-with-axoloti/3288</link>
    <description>so my AE modular has just arrived, its a budget modular (~ 30 euro/module!) which Im going to be doing some serious integration with axoloti with .... hence recent questions.

I think its a great match for axoloti since a) its cheap b) sounds great ... and works 0..5v which is pretty simple to interface to axoloti 0..3.3v.
being &#39;cheap&#39; means for electronics newbies like me, I&#39;m not worried about blowing up $$$ of gear by connecting up axoloti... and i also see axoloti as being able to easily add lots of value. 
(unlike eurorack where you could just modules off the shelf, to add the value!) 

anyway, Ive put together a couple of videos, both using axoloti simply for reverb and midi interfacing... (deeper integration is &#39;on its ways&#39;) 


part one - first encounter 
an intro, to let people hear it... what does 500 euro get you? 
(summary: 18 modules, case, power, nice sound - fun :) ) 
http://youtu.be/mHltcopQgjc

part two - interfacing to other stuff ;) 
connecting up to bastl kastl,  and then a prototype board to give me a cheap extra oscillator/lfo and analog sequencer (probably about $10 in parts!) 
http://youtu.be/yJ9XncZI1lo


apologies for soft focus, camera seems to have moved... also for my lack of modular experience and the naivety in the joy of its sound :)

my understanding is, after KS pledges are delivered, tangible waves will open a web shop for buying AE modular and modules.</description>

              <p>A +1 for the AE Modular + Axoloti combo.</p>

<p>I initially bought an AE Modular as I was looking for Modulars but didn't have the money for all those 300$ modules and then saw the Axoloti on AE's Forum through <a class="mention" href="/u/thetechnobear">@thetechnobear</a>  which drew me here.</p>

<p>The AE Modular has its quirks and oddities but I think the Axoloti really compliments it.</p>

<p>Physical and Digital patching at the same time is very very fun.</p>

<p>So before I started on the BelaMini module,  I actually had started on a different project for connecting to AE modular,  connecting Axoloti!  this is not finished but as I had the</p>

</p>

<p>however, the issue is the axoloti longer than the AE module height (even without midi) , so its difficult to fit in the case... and the boards I made were a bit big too <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  so i was considering putting it externally, with a ribbon cable, but that reduces the immediacy </p>

<p>... but I was reconsidering this the other day, given the usefulness Axoloti would provide, perhaps using a larger amount of rackspace is ok … <br>(the racks are not that expensive, and Ive expanded beyond the original rack already <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> )</p>
