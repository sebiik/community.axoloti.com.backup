    <title>How to access HID functions?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/how-to-access-hid-functions/592</link>
    <description>Hi, i bought a USB (computer) keyboard and would like to use it as a button box for axoloti.

I&#39;m aware that is hard to find a fits for all solution, however i&#39;d like to get some advice for making custom objects.

Is there any code i should know? Something like the 
&gt; outlet_left = hid_buttons[0];
&gt; outlet_right = hid_buttons[1];
&gt; outlet_middle = hid_buttons[2];
&gt; outlet_x = hid_mouse_x;
&gt; outlet_y = hid_mouse_y;

Inside the usb/mouse object</description>

              <p>ah, indeed I found that changing the <br>hid_mouse_x+=<br>into<br>hid_mouse_x=<br>(and for y the same)<br>does do the job partly for the y axis, although it only goes from 0 to 7 and the x axis goes all over the place.<br>so.. ehm.. change the bit-inputs for the x/y axis?</p>

<blockquote><p>Ive just had a look at the code, looks complete to me... as its from the STM lib as part of the HID class with the mouse.   the only thing missing is in ubs_conf.c/h we would need to expose the keyb info.   the primary issue I see, is what would the object look like... as axoloti has little string/character handling, so its would be hard to make it do anything useful, without writing a UI object...  the only thing a simple object could so is output an ascii code.. and then perhaps this shift/ctrâ€¦</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>there is already low level support in the STM firmware, and this has been extended up to the axoloti firmware.<br>However, we have not exposed it  i.e. to get to the hid_buttons level which objects can use.</p>

<p>it would be pretty trivial to add, and certainly would work for your needs (i.e. just outputting ascii or keyboard codes),  but for boarder needs it gets a bit more complicated.</p>

<p>if your interested the file is:<br>firmware/usbh_conf.c<br>and the structure is defined in:<br>firmware/STM32_USB_Host_Library/Class/HID/Inc/usbh_hid_keybd.h </p>

<p>at the trivial level, is just a matter of exposing the structure, and then creating an axo object to use it.</p>

<p>one small point, the firmware has a limitation of:  AZERTY or QWERTY mappings (and the firmware has to be compiled differently for each), and a max of 6 simultaneous keys.</p>
