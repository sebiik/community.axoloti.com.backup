    <title>Delivery problem :(</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/delivery-problem/6101</link>
    <description>Hello, 
I have ordered an Axoloti last week, and even if the shipping adress is perfectly correct, the postman has apparently decided that it couldn&#39;t be delivered. 
Apparently it&#39;s back to Johannes now. 
How can this be solved? It&#39;s even more frustrating since i&#39;m working in brussels every day ^^

Thanks in advance</description>

<p>Yes, indeed, that's why I was super surprised when the postal services website explained that the package has been returned. Even more since it's my work address, other packages have been delivered before at that exact place without problems, and there is always someone there to get the packages. (and, obvously, the addresse is correct ^^)  </p>

<p>I just don't get what happened</p>

<p>I Hope he'll answer here ^^</p>

<p>But he can be hard to get a hold of.</p>

<p>I want to add that Johannes lives in Gent area. Maybe you can arrange to get it in person instead of waiting for postal services one more time? <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
