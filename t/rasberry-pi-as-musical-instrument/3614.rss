<p>Seems like they think 0.48 is stable now, it hasnt changed for a while, so thats great. I still use mostly 0.47, but mostly because the first couple of versions I tried of 0.48 was really unstable. But maybe it stime to change soon <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>To me to most important thing to get going is getting 48khz working on it. Since all the new patches I have made is made at 48 khz. And I dont use much externals anyway, mostly zexy and cyclone and they are widely availbale so I am covered in most situations anyway. But, when I am done with t patch I am working on I will try 48khz.</p>

              <p>update: just spoke to owen, appears the arch linux distro used for Organelle already has 0.48 available, so we have updated to that for testing, if no issues appear then this will be included in the next release (then I can port my patches over to clone - yay!) </p>

<p>rPI, Im still going to stick with raspbian's  0.47.3 version until they upgrade their distro.</p>

<p>I didn't say that, I said.. you should <strong>also</strong> not run X, and then you can start pd with pd -nogui, and this can be done with any version of pd ... organelle does this with 0.46.x.<br>and my point was, 0.48 might allow PD to stop its gui, but it wont kill X... so you will still have a big resource hog running.<br>I think this live switching is more useful  for windows/mac, because you cannot stop their window manger (unlike linux), so stopping PD running its gui thread is about as good as it gets. (perhaps its also to get rid of PDs annoying windows)</p>

<p>and you dont have to reboot a PI to stop X windows... </p>

<p>anyway, this gets quickly into a discussion about the best way to run headless/minimal setups on a PI, which is quite a bit beyond not running pd with a gui, or even stopping X.</p>

<p>yes, sudo apt get install puredata  ... or use the package manager app , which does the same thing <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>If you want to use it as an instrument as stand alone you need to be able to boot it in GUI-less mode. That is what most Pi3's running pure data does, when not connected to a display. So it is kind of important, especially for lower ressources system like the PI3. And it does save ressources, from what I could read around the web. The Graphics are actually heavier than one thinks. And it would be nice to have that .048 feature where you can switch to guiless mode to see how the patch runs, without having to reboot pi or PD or whatever.</p>

<p>Yes this was not related to Pi3, just a general good thing.</p>

<p>sudo apt get install puredata</p>

<p>Actually yeah, after gaining a bit more knowledge about it since I was playing with it  I think there is not a specific GUI-less version, you can just run pd in GUI-less mode to save ressources. These are command lines for when running in GUI-less mode or to boot pure data in GUI-less mode.</p>

<p>Not anything special. I can do with 0.47 I use that on my Mac too. But I thought I might as well get the latest 0.48. </p>

<p>But one thing that is nice about 0.48, beside the vst stuff, I havent gotten around to yet, is also that you should be able to switch to GUI-less mode from within Pure data. That would bee great to have too when working with larger patches.</p>

<p>Isnt the apt get version a GUI less version?I think it was when I installed it.</p>

<p>But on this webpage it says that 0.48 is "official Debian package ("apt-get")" version:<br><a href="https://puredata.info/downloads/pure-data" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://puredata.info/downloads/pure-data</a></p>

<p>Marc do you also know how I can find out which version i get by doing an apt get? Before installing it of course.</p>

<p>if your using a different distro your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if distro has updated to 0.48 yet, as its relatively new, I'm not too interested, as I want to retain compatibility between my rPI and Organelle... so until we move that to 48, I'm only use 46 feature set <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>(quite keen to move Organelle to 47, just for clone though)</p>

              <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="/u/gavin">@Gavin</a></p>

<p>Uh, the Pi3 project has been a bit on hold since I got the Organelle, heheh <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>I can tell you which version that I installed. I got the version suggested in this link:<br><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=142307" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=142307</a></p>

<p>Go down to comment by Gregorth, dated Wed Apr 27, 2016 10:35 pm and follow the instructions. This is 0.46 and it works here. In the same description is also a link to most of the externals that you can install manually.</p>

<p>I DID NOT install the version that you can install by searching in the Pi3 app installer, or by doing "apt get" cause I was told it was not a good version. I also tried L2Ork but the browser in that version drives me nuts, but I guess it is a matter of taste. So I ended up with the link above.</p>

<p>I was also just googling around a bit and I think I am going to try to install the new 0.48 from here:<br><a href="https://puredata.info/downloads/pure-data" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://puredata.info/downloads/pure-data</a></p>

<p>Actually now I am reading "official Debian package ("apt-get") about the link above.<br>Maybe try to find out which version the "apt get" install gives you today.. If it gives you 0.48 I would definetely go with that one. </p>

<p>Sorry if this is not much help, as said it has been on hold for a while so there might have happened new things since then.</p>

<p>I'd also like to add this is the first i  have messed around with Linux so I apologize if i am saying somethign that might be able to be done in a smarter way.</p>

<p>Same here, and about time as well, I've been waiting for a full-hd screen for my Pi ever since I started using it as a desktop replacement.  With that screen, I'm gonna build a miniature RPi3 laptop (or rather palmtop)!</p>

<p>One thing to note about that screen though: the good news is it's manufactured by Sharp, the bad news is it's not IPS if those specs are anything to go by (having an 80 degree viewing angle).  Love the physical design though, clean and symmetrical, and without any distracting logo!</p>

              <p>Yes the official PS for pi3 is 2.5, I got a "semi" official one. And I run keyboard, mouse from USB and the UCA 202 USB interface and a VGA display over a HDMI to VGA adapter and all works. I havent tested if under powered or not, but it seems to work.</p>

<p>I also first tried with an Ipad charger, with very bad result. Didnt work, the whole system seemed unreliable. I saw someone had done it, but I dont think they had alot of stuff connected to the Pi that needed power. But with 2.5 it works great here.</p>

              <p>a bit of good news... I think Ive just found out why my display was flicking which was my bugbear of the setup... </p>

<p>power.... or lack of....<br>apparently the PI3 should be used with 2.5a (rather than the 2A i got for my PI2) , and given Ive got the LCD, pisound, wireless keyboard... I suspect Im going to need all of that.<br>(in fact I even get undervoltage warnings without the LCD attached) </p>

<p>so... I'm going to need to order a new power supply, hopefully that will allow me to make peace with the rPI and the waveshare display... which apart from the flicker Ive noticed is actually fine.</p>

<p>Yeah I think i will be making most patches on the computer anyway, but still nice with a touch screen for interacting with patches. And do some basic editing on. </p>

<p>Manga 2 looks nice. And can be backordered for delivery in october... hmmmm... <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>After reading everything about the Pisound it does sound appealing. And the interaction with pure data is great.</p>

<p>yeah, I think the thing that might be helpful around pisound is the community, somewhere to go for help. I find generally the rPI community is pretty split up.<br>e.g. you can download a MODDEP install which will just work (I assume :)) for the pisound.</p>

<p>btw, one thing Ive found with Organelle , is for patching.. its easier to use your computer as a remote X display, rather than use any kind of lcd/hdmi. </p>

<p>of course, it may be you still need a touch display for creating a control surface though.</p>

<p>I bought a waveshare 7" which is ok, but I don't find it very sharp... </p>

<blockquote><p>Sorry this might be a stupid question...... But I am a bit curious about how one would use the official display with the Pisound? isn't the display also mounted on top of the Pi3?</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>I assume the official display is similar to the waveshare, in which case its no issue... <br>rPI mounts to back of display, but with gpio pins out , so then the pisound sits on that.<br>(obviously 'the button' , and pots are now behind the display when in use, but still accessible)</p>

<p>with the waveshare lcd, its even still sits on the stand properly <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>... I think its pretty common for PI uses to need access to gpio pins, or have something on them/</p>
