<blockquote><p>No, it's got the GUI. <br>Not even sure there is a gui-less version, thats just a (optional) command line option when you start pd</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>Actually yeah, after gaining a bit more knowledge about it since I was playing with it  I think there is not a specific GUI-less version, you can just run pd in GUI-less mode to save ressources. These are command lines for when running in GUI-less mode or to boot pure data in GUI-less mode.</p>

<p>Not anything special. I can do with 0.47 I use that on my Mac too. But I thought I might as well get the latest 0.48. </p>

<p>But one thing that is nice about 0.48, beside the vst stuff, I havent gotten around to yet, is also that you should be able to switch to GUI-less mode from within Pure data. That would bee great to have too when working with larger patches.</p>

<p>well vsts are pointless on the PI... and are already possible with 47, they have just refined the API in 48... and I dont know if the current VST PD bridges have even updated to use this yet.

<p>switching gui-less, also seems kind of pointless to me on a PI, one of the main reasons to run PD guileless on a PI, is so that you dont have to start X windows....

<p>yes, deken is in 47 </p>

<p>fyi, Im going to chat to with owen (c&amp;g) about if we should move organelle to 47 or 48... Ive suggested 48, but only so we dont later have to do another build... but maybe we will go with 47.3 for its stability, and also as I said clone is my desire <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>If you want to use it as an instrument as stand alone you need to be able to boot it in GUI-less mode. That is what most Pi3's running pure data does, when not connected to a display. So it is kind of important, especially for lower ressources system like the PI3. And it does save ressources, from what I could read around the web. The Graphics are actually heavier than one thinks. And it would be nice to have that .048 feature where you can switch to guiless mode to see how the patch runs, without having to reboot pi or PD or whatever.</p>

<p>Yes this was not related to Pi3, just a general good thing.</p>

<p>So to get version 0.47 i do this?:</p>

<p>sudo apt get install puredata</p>

<p>I didn't say that, I said.. you should <strong>also</strong> not run X, and then you can start pd with pd -nogui, and this can be done with any version of pd ... organelle does this with 0.46.x.<br>and my point was, 0.48 might allow PD to stop its gui, but it wont kill X... so you will still have a big resource hog running.<br>I think this live switching is more useful  for windows/mac, because you cannot stop their window manger (unlike linux), so stopping PD running its gui thread is about as good as it gets. (perhaps its also to get rid of PDs annoying windows)</p>

<p>and you dont have to reboot a PI to stop X windows... </p>

<p>anyway, this gets quickly into a discussion about the best way to run headless/minimal setups on a PI, which is quite a bit beyond not running pd with a gui, or even stopping X.</p>

<p>yes, sudo apt get install puredata  ... or use the package manager app , which does the same thing <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

        <p>update: just spoke to owen, appears the arch linux distro used for Organelle already has 0.48 available, so we have updated to that for testing, if no issues appear then this will be included in the next release (then I can port my patches over to clone - yay!) </p>

<p>rPI, Im still going to stick with raspbian's  0.47.3 version until they upgrade their distro.</p>

<p>EDIT: ok, just noticed some patches are not running well on 48 for organelle,  so this might not happen after all <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

        <p>Actually still building patches for Organelle. But getting there <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>To me to most important thing to get going is getting 48khz working on it. Since all the new patches I have made is made at 48 khz. And I dont use much externals anyway, mostly zexy and cyclone and they are widely availbale so I am covered in most situations anyway. But, when I am done with t patch I am working on I will try 48khz.</p>

        <p>good news, Ive built the PD 48 package manually, and its now working fine on Organelle.<br>(seems to break a couple of patches, but it looks like they might possibly have legitimate errors in them)</p>

<p>so hopefully we are back on, for having this in the new release<br>(Ive supplied package and build info for owen to test at CG)</p>

        <p>Great <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>Seems like they think 0.48 is stable now, it hasnt changed for a while, so thats great. I still use mostly 0.47, but mostly because the first couple of versions I tried of 0.48 was really unstable. But maybe it stime to change soon <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
