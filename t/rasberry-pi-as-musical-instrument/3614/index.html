        <p>Hi all!<br>I'm thinking about getting an Axoloti and I was reading around the forum when I read this post talking about Organelle... I love Pure Data, I am a begginer but as I love the Organelle as well I did my best to clone it with a Raspberry Pi, the official RPi 7" display, a pHat DAC by Pimorony and a MIDI keyboard.<br>I hope you enjoy the video! <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="qLxfFkfWvAs" data-youtube-title="Critter &amp; Guitari Organelle Clone with Raspberry Pi 3 and Pure Data" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>

<p>The project was quite challenging and interesting. Pros and Cons?</p>

<p>Pros: <br>- Half the price (MUCH less if, like me, you already have a Raspberry Pi, a sound card and a MIDI controller! (actually the only things I had to buy for the project was the official RPi display, the case for the display and the Lego figure <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>- Screen is much more useful, it's a touchscreen and its big enough to connect a keyboard and a mouse and start editing the PD patches (I did tons of editing on it!) Also you can customize/design to show whatever you need for your project (values: volume, pitch, screen number..., sliders and buttons!!!, interfaces (make a customized 'front panel' screen!, GEM animations...)<br>- You can use many patches at the same time, the only limit is the Raspberry Pi processor power (and I used up to 4 patches at the same time with no issues!!)<br>- Well, it's a Raspberry, so you can use it for whatever you want appart from being a clone of one of the most amazing synths in History!<br>- You can use the MIDI controller you want/have and use it for anything else!<br>- WEEKS of fun developing/improving the Organelle patches and making them to your own taste (YOU LEARN A LOT OF PURE DATA)<br>- 100% portable, I use a powerbank for days of fun with one charge.</p>

<p>Now the Cons:<br>- Well, it's not an Organelle, and an Organelle is COOL <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/sunglasses.png?v=5" title=":sunglasses:" class="emoji" alt=":sunglasses:"></p>

<p>Cheers,<br>I hope to see you soon in other threads when I get my Axoloti! <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>Nice. <br>I'm building something similar, despite having an organelle - have you seen geerts buildroot post, this is probably the way forward for rPI ( if your a developer)</p>

<p>I'd say though you are missing the 2 big pro of organellle.<br>- common form factor for users means you just share patches and they work. = immediacy. <br>- everything in one small box (keyboard/knobs/display) = immediacy. </p>

<p>And it's the immediacy, turn on and use that I've enjoyed most on the organelle , for sure I can build similar , but being bespoke , it doesn't have the community , or the integration</p>

<p>Of course the flip side, and why I'm building with rpi/bela is it can be whatever you want it to be, there are no form factor limitations</p>

<p>Now.... when Axoloti control comes along, that's going to change the game <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

        <p>I am also building something similar. I got the Pi3 and a Behringer UCA-202 working well together and pure data running fine. And for midi controller I use a Novation Launch controller, works straight out of the box. I still need midi IO, so it can sync with other devices, but not sure <em>what</em> to get. Any suggestions for midi I/O for the PI3?</p>

<p>Next step is getting my 3.5" touch screen working. </p>

<p>I had also intentions of getting an Organelle, but I have delayed cause I want to see how far I can get with the PI3 build first.</p>

<p>I do have plans about trying to make it work similar to and organelle, but I have NO idea yet on how to make this work. One step at a time, I guess.....:<br>- Boot directly into pure data, in no GUI version. <br>- Be able to switch patches, from my device.<br>- Also be able to connect keyboard mouse etc. so I can also use it for programming directly on the device itself.</p>

        <p><a class="mention" href="/u/jaffasplaffa">@jaffasplaffa</a>  perhaps have a look at the blokas.io pisound... 99 euro , and it looks like its immediately available.</p>

<p>gives you midi io, and an audio interface attached, so you don't need an extra dongle <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>also they are providing some software support, which might help if your not too familiar with Linux.<br>they have a forum, so they can help you get it running.<br>I think their aim is very much a 'standalone' box, during KS they promised an iOS app that would then let you switch PD patches.</p>

<p>I'm not quite sure how far they have got with it all, as not much activity on the forum... and I only had the time to check the hardware was working.... and now I'm very much tempted to go the buildroot route, when I do get underway with it.<br></p><div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="brBYhjwltdo" data-youtube-title="Raspberry PI 3 super small and fast custom Linux distribution for Audio and MIDI" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>

<p>apart from that, I've used a cheap USB to MIDI cable works fine, automatically detected by Alsa.<br>or of course use Axoloti as a USB -&gt; MIDI din route (Ive one Axoloti with this as its startup patch :))</p>

        <p>Looks good. I FINALLY got rid of my UAD card.... YAY.. That did free up some finances for other projects like this <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>Yeah had been looking at that Pisound before, but it wasnt available. Great to see it is now.</p>

<p>Should probably also get the official display like everyone esle. The one I got was a cheap china one for 10€.... So Pisound + the official display = easier for me....</p>

<p>yeah, I think the thing that might be helpful around pisound is the community, somewhere to go for help. I find generally the rPI community is pretty split up.<br>e.g. you can download a MODDEP install which will just work (I assume :)) for the pisound.</p>

<p>btw, one thing Ive found with Organelle , is for patching.. its easier to use your computer as a remote X display, rather than use any kind of lcd/hdmi. </p>

<p>of course, it may be you still need a touch display for creating a control surface though.</p>

<p>I bought a waveshare 7" which is ok, but I don't find it very sharp... </p>

<p>I assume the official display is similar to the waveshare, in which case its no issue... <br>rPI mounts to back of display, but with gpio pins out , so then the pisound sits on that.<br>(obviously 'the button' , and pots are now behind the display when in use, but still accessible)</p>

<p>with the waveshare lcd, its even still sits on the stand properly <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>... I think its pretty common for PI uses to need access to gpio pins, or have something on them/</p>

<p>Yeah I think i will be making most patches on the computer anyway, but still nice with a touch screen for interacting with patches. And do some basic editing on. </p>

<p>Manga 2 looks nice. And can be backordered for delivery in october... hmmmm... <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>a bit of good news... I think Ive just found out why my display was flicking which was my bugbear of the setup... </p>

<p>power.... or lack of....<br>apparently the PI3 should be used with 2.5a (rather than the 2A i got for my PI2) , and given Ive got the LCD, pisound, wireless keyboard... I suspect Im going to need all of that.<br>(in fact I even get undervoltage warnings without the LCD attached) </p>

<p>so... I'm going to need to order a new power supply, hopefully that will allow me to make peace with the rPI and the waveshare display... which apart from the flicker Ive noticed is actually fine.</p>

        <p>Yes the official PS for pi3 is 2.5, I got a "semi" official one. And I run keyboard, mouse from USB and the UCA 202 USB interface and a VGA display over a HDMI to VGA adapter and all works. I havent tested if under powered or not, but it seems to work.</p>

<p>I also first tried with an Ipad charger, with very bad result. Didnt work, the whole system seemed unreliable. I saw someone had done it, but I dont think they had alot of stuff connected to the Pi that needed power. But with 2.5 it works great here.</p>

<p>Same here, and about time as well, I've been waiting for a full-hd screen for my Pi ever since I started using it as a desktop replacement.  With that screen, I'm gonna build a miniature RPi3 laptop (or rather palmtop)!</p>

<p>One thing to note about that screen though: the good news is it's manufactured by Sharp, the bad news is it's not IPS if those specs are anything to go by (having an 80 degree viewing angle).  Love the physical design though, clean and symmetrical, and without any distracting logo!</p>

        <p>one thing I noticed about the manga, the dongle on the back is pretty deep, looks to be about same as PI. not really an issue with just a PI, but add a pisound, and it's getting quite bulky. <br>( Noticed similar on bela , 1 board extra is ok, 2 starts to affect its compactness)</p>

<p>Also a pity they don't have an option for one with speaker , or some kind of audio output- given hdmi can carry audio - not an issue here, as dont want to use built in sound card , but for general PI solutions might have been nice. </p>

<p>I wonder if they will supply some nice flat hdmi cable, waveshare came with a nice one, but even then it's still a bit of a cable mess <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>Not an issue if you put it in an enclosure of course. </p>

<p>Anyway, hope later they will gets European distributor, then I'll likely get one.</p>

<p>Same here, won't purchase unless there's a way to dispatch from the UK.  There's a store in the UK called 'The Pi Hut' which sells all that sort of stuff, so I reckon they'll likely stock it.  I'll be very surprised if they don't.</p>

        <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="/u/gavin">@Gavin</a></p>

<p>Uh, the Pi3 project has been a bit on hold since I got the Organelle, heheh <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>I can tell you which version that I installed. I got the version suggested in this link:<br><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=142307" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=142307</a></p>

<p>Go down to comment by Gregorth, dated Wed Apr 27, 2016 10:35 pm and follow the instructions. This is 0.46 and it works here. In the same description is also a link to most of the externals that you can install manually.</p>

<p>I DID NOT install the version that you can install by searching in the Pi3 app installer, or by doing "apt get" cause I was told it was not a good version. I also tried L2Ork but the browser in that version drives me nuts, but I guess it is a matter of taste. So I ended up with the link above.</p>

<p>I was also just googling around a bit and I think I am going to try to install the new 0.48 from here:<br><a href="https://puredata.info/downloads/pure-data" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://puredata.info/downloads/pure-data</a></p>

<p>Actually now I am reading "official Debian package ("apt-get") about the link above.<br>Maybe try to find out which version the "apt get" install gives you today.. If it gives you 0.48 I would definetely go with that one. </p>

<p>Sorry if this is not much help, as said it has been on hold for a while so there might have happened new things since then.</p>

<p>I'd also like to add this is the first i  have messed around with Linux so I apologize if i am saying somethign that might be able to be done in a smarter way.</p>

        <p>I'm pretty sure apt-get on raspbian stretch gives you 0.47,  and this worked 'out of the box' for me.<br>perhaps as the post you linked to is over a year old, things have moved on , as certainly most of the steps details are irrelevant, as alsa and the kernel is configured on most distros for PI.</p>

<p>if your using a different distro your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if distro has updated to 0.48 yet, as its relatively new, I'm not too interested, as I want to retain compatibility between my rPI and Organelle... so until we move that to 48, I'm only use 46 feature set <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>(quite keen to move Organelle to 47, just for clone though)</p>

<p>Isnt the apt get version a GUI less version?I think it was when I installed it.</p>

<p>But on this webpage it says that 0.48 is "official Debian package ("apt-get")" version:<br><a href="https://puredata.info/downloads/pure-data" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://puredata.info/downloads/pure-data</a></p>

<p>Maybe it is soon time to dust of the Pi3 project and install it again <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Also got a display laying in a drawer waiting to be installed.</p>

<p>Marc do you also know how I can find out which version i get by doing an apt get? Before installing it of course.</p>
