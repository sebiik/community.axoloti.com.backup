    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/experiences-with-behringer-fcb1010-midi-controller/1000</link>
    <description>Hi! 

Has any of you got any experience with connecting the Behringer FCB1010 MIDI-controller to the Axaloti?
Or... does anyone of you know the guy in the video below? I might like to ask him some questions on using it with a (bass) guitar.

Thanks in advance!</description>

              <p>Hi Emanuel,</p>

<p>I bought a really beat up old FCB1010 (with the UNO mod) and I use it for the same kinds of things.  I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to get started.  What I recommend doing is making yourself a really quick little "midi sniffer" patch.  The point is so that you can just use the axoloti patcher to see what signals your FCB1010 is sending when you push various buttons.  This is far faster, in my opinion, than bothering with any actual documentation!</p>

<p>I'm not sharing my patch right now because it's more messy and complex than it needs to be, but it is super simple to do this.  Just make a new patch and go to Edit/New Object... From there, navigate to factory/midi/in and select, just to start, the 'cc any' object.  Then also put some display objects in your patch... factory/disp/bool or factory/disp/i or factory/disp/dial p are examples.  Basically you just want to stick them in and connect them to the outputs of the 'cc any' object.  Use the color codes on the various in/outs to make sure you're sending the appropriate kind of information for each display.  Then just make it live and start pushing buttons and you will directly see what data the axoloti is receiving.</p>

<p>You can do the same kind of thing with the other midi input objects just to see what kinds of information your Behringer is sending.  Once you've gotten that far, you're half-way there... you can use the various midi input signals to trigger whatever you want in any patch, or directly link midi CC to a parameter in an object.  For example, if you drop the factory/stomps/wah1 into a patch and right click on the frequency dial, it gives you an option to tie that parameter to any midi CC channel. </p>

<p>I know sharing patches would be more helpful, but walking through these steps is pretty fast and then you are already on your way to figuring out how to do more powerful, customized things.  Hope that helps.</p>

I would like to patch the axoloti for the Behringer FCB1010 (that's the reason why I did not open another topic but posted my question here). Does anyone have a patch to share with me? I would like to use the Behringer as a looper and multieffect pedal. I would be glad about any hints from the community. Thank you all in advance.<br>Best, Emanuel</p>

<p>If I'm right, the FCB never shows up LEDs to make sure whether something has been toggled on/off? Neither with the original or with the UNO chip?</p>

<p>For using it in live music, I really need to have some footswitches, and the expression pedal(s) are really what I am looking for!</p>

I can also highly recommend the software editor they're selling. <br>I am using the FCB together with Axoloti and I am quite happy about it, although it still lacks visual Feedback. If you're into that you might wanna lock for a different controller.<br>I plan on using my Novation Launchcontrol XL for more knobs and LEDS with visual feedback. But if you want something smaller and cheaper you could also add a korg nanokontrol to edit parameters of your effects and show you wether the effect is on or off.</p>

<p>I contacted Tim Vets on this, and his findings were alike.<br>I now have to chance to buy a 2ndhand Behringer FCB1010 with what seems to be a well known firmware update in form of a chip: <a href="http://www.ossandust.be/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ossandust.be/</a> . It should solve some bugs and give you the ability to toggle the switches as if they were stompboxes.</p>
