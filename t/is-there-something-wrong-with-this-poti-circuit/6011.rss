    <title>Is there something wrong with this poti circuit?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/is-there-something-wrong-with-this-poti-circuit/6011</link>
    <description>Hi, I had really great time using my first axoloti this year, so when the last batch came out, I recommend to a great friend to buy one and start to build his own synth. But he is in a great trouble because his circuit didn&#39;t worked. It was his first soldering project so I was thinking about a bad solder join somewhere, I&#39;ve redo all the circuit myself after I cleaned it up, nothing changed...

Here is a pictures of the circuit : &lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0366cdf496b329a2aaf1ba5051055d99e4bbe4fc.JPG&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;459&quot;&gt;

Mounted like that :

All poti are 10k. I&#39;ve tried with all VDD and GND. I&#39;m 100% sure it&#39;s not the female hader on the board because I&#39;ve tried all analog in individually with a breadboard and all worked finely. I&#39;ve watched carefully if any wire touch another one, it&#39;s clean.

Maybe it&#39;s because he used this for wiring ? : http://www.e44.com/outillage/realisation-circuit-imprime/plaques-d-experimentations/lot-100-strap-en-bande-0.6mm-52mm-max-7.5a-jumper-JUMPER-100.html

Somebody have an idea to save my friend from his hard impatience ?

              <p>I've done 10 other projects with 10 other axoloti-core. So I've understood an Issue with the board, when you connect 15 poti's to the board, for exemple like me all 10k poti's, my problem was the push button I wanted to connect with them. I've plugged it into the Digital input "PC5". Doing this is terribly wrong, it's everytime affecting two potentiometer or sometimes more, I don't know why. So now I connect everytime the pushbutton to the PB8 and everything work well everytime.</p>

<p>If you did the same, keep this in mind. But for me a 15 10K potentiometer circuit work well everytime now.</p>

<p>Are you using modsource objects? I mention this because you have to set the maximum number in the patch preferences, that caught me out for a while.</p>

              <p>So, I think that idea with nude wire were not good. We probably made a short circuit somewhere, cause I've tested all potentiometer of the circuit with a multimeter, they was all totally dead. I've replaced them with 15 brand new, with normal wire, everything is working now. Thanks to all for your help, a multimeter was a great idea, now I have one !</p>

<p>I think it's probably because I've soldered my poti in the little hole and not in the 3 legs too. I've broke a brand new one by doing this. I didn't know that we can't do this...</p>

              <p>Seems strange... They are all 10K pots? Not 1M!? In parallel, they will draw about 5mA from the Axoloti board which isn't a problem. It sounds like they're floating and not at any particular voltage which suggests the pots aren't getting 3.3V. A multimeter is needed!</p>

<p>I'm assuming those wires carrying GND and 3.3V are bare wire? Check they're not touching the metal on the casing pots.</p>

<p>Check each potentiometer with a simple patch like this:<br><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/d/da594631d3193b1d714083c3aee5a38002b2b2d6.png" width="355" height="139"></p>

<p>The reading on the display should be steady and range from 0 to 63.</p>

<p>If you're not getting any thing, do you have a multimeter? Check you're getting 3.3V between Vdda and GND on the pots. Check that you're getting a steady voltage that goes 0V to 3.3V on a potentiometer. Also make sure the Vdda and GND wires aren't touching - PA3 looks risky!</p>
