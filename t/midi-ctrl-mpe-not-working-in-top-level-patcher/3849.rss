    <title>Midi/ctrl/mpe not working in top level patcher?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/midi-ctrl-mpe-not-working-in-top-level-patcher/3849</link>
    <description>Not sure it&#39;s a bug or feature: it looks like the factory mpe object doesn&#39;t work at all when in a top-level patcher, whereas other midi objects do work fine. Normal, or am I missing something?
I&#39;m testing with a Seaboard RISE and had to use the attached patch (with MPE subpatcher, polyphony = 1) to observe what this midi controller does.</description>

              <p>Actually, I think it's very useful to observe in a main patch what a MPE controller gives you (actual range, etc.)<br>I was thinking that in a top-level patch, it would just behave like a sub-patch with polyphony set to 1. Indeed, it's not necessary to allow that since one can just make it (that's what I ended up doing for my tests):<br><a class="attachment" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/0/04e97610a9e96d7c7d4620922f77926bc902d44b.axp">observe-mpe.axp</a> (6.8 KB)</p>

<p>not really... MPE by definition requires multiple voices, and also encompasses a voice allocation strategy...<br>how would this work on a top level patch, which only has one voice?<br>(and if you have only one voice why would you need 'polyphonic expression' <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ) </p>

<p>(I suspect it will 'work', if you set the midi channel of the main patch to the same channel as the note is coming in on, but remember, <strong>most</strong> mpe controllers are going to rotate channels, so thats really of no use!) </p>

<p>midi/in/keyb on the other hand is not voiced at all, it actually would be better labelled as 'midi note on/off', it merely takes any midi note on event and puts out the output.</p>

<p>this is why examples and help (which also exists for midi/ctrl/mpe) are provided, to give a 'template' to new users who aren't sure of how things are works.... just grabbing an object and assuming it will work in a a particular way, is not always going to be productive.</p>

              <p>Yes, examples work fine. It's just surprising that it doesn't work at all in top-level, whereas midi/in/keyb works, for instance. That's ok, just a thing to be aware of. Thanks.</p>
