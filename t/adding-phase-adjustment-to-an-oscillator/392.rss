    <title>Adding Phase adjustment to an Oscillator</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/adding-phase-adjustment-to-an-oscillator/392</link>
    <description>Hi - I&#39;ve noticed some objects have a dedicated phase inlet, but I am wondering if an oscillator phase can be patched in aswell. For example, I would like phase adjustment on the triangle oscillator - is it better for me to just add it into the object? I also would like to add it to the Phasor Compl object, so maybe there is a way to just patch it in that I don&#39;t know about.
Excuse my lack of knowledge!</description>

<p>A use case where phase control of the oscillator is essential is for bass. I play around with a lot of different music styles, and in for example trance genre phase control of the bass is very important. With out any phase control the bass will not be tight.</p>

              <p>Using phasor compl to run through a sample table - was wondering if i can have two of them but start to offset one. I use the Freq inlet with frequency modulation on the Phasor compl so wouldn't want to swap it for a phasor lin.</p>

<p>*btw - my instrument that uses a triangle oscillator has a math/wrap object anyway..so i kind of gave up on anti-aliasing with that one (sorry)</p>
