    <title>How to edit a patch that&#39;s already been uploaded into the hardware?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/how-to-edit-a-patch-thats-already-been-uploaded-into-the-hardware/4902</link>
    <description>Looks like it&#39;s my first topic so hello, Axoloti community!

I&#39;ve been in possession of an Axoloti Core for a while now, however I didn&#39;t take the time to really dive in yet. I uploaded a user&#39;s patch several months ago and started to mess around with the hardware both as FX unit and USB host, everything was working great, but then I fell into another rabbit&#39;s hole and left the Axoloti. 

Now that I&#39;m ready to explore it again, I&#39;d like to reopen the currently embedded patch to study it and remind myself what it does and how. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s easy but I can&#39;t figure out how to do this. Is it possible?

I don&#39;t have the original patch on my computer anymore because it crashed a while ago. I could look for it online, I would probably find it again but I&#39;d rather solve this before - as a kind of basic learning challenge :slight_smile:

Thanks for your help!</description>

              <p>well, compiling is a one way operation mostly, you generate machine code from a programming language (c++ in our case). the patcher is an even higher abstraction of this, allowing non programmers to create those patches. so the process is twofold: from patcher to c file and from c file to compiled binary.</p>

              <p>OK, thanks for your answers!<br>Out of curiosity, is it because the compilation process makes it impossible to send back into the editor?</p>

              <p>If the patch is on the SD card, you could put the card in your computer and load it from there via "Open" in the menu. I think that's the only way to get a patch `back' from the hardware.</p>
