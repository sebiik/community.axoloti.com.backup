    <title>Sample Scrubber</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/sample-scrubber/3310</link>
    <description>
I&#39;m curious, has anyone created a sample scrubber patch (or dedicated object) that lets you attach, say a knob, and directly scrub backwards and forwards by twisting it, like the effect you get when scrubbing (scratching) on vinyl?

What I&#39;m after is a very basic sample player, without any of the granular stuff, I just want the knob to directly play the sample as I spin it back and forth, and for the sample to change pitch according to the twisting of the knob speed.  And, for the sample to start (and stay) at whatever position the knob last stopped moving.

Basically, a sample version of vinyl being forced backward and forward.

I can&#39;t try anything at the moment as I don&#39;t have Axoloti installed on this system.  But I&#39;m preparing a Linux box especially for Axoloti and other audio stuff, so I&#39;ll try anything and everything suggested once I have it up and running.</description>

              <p>Just thought I'd bump this thread for the attention of <a class="mention" href="/u/urklang">@urklang</a>.</p>

<p>Check-out how many downloads were stated in the post above, and then look at the post before that one, which is, at the time of writing this post, now at 41 downloads.</p>

<p>This is a clear example of what I am talking about in your project thread, it shows that the users are starved of this stuff because it's just far too low-level for a heck of a lot of us around here.  Now 41 might not sound like a lot of downloads, but I see the number as a popularity percentage indicator, as in, I don't think I've seen any other patch on this forum downloaded as much as that one, not even close.</p>

<p>It's popular because it's a sample-based object for a platform where building sample-based stuff is far too low-level, and too hard for many to comprehend - even a basic sample scrubber!</p>

<p>This is great, cheers Lokki.  I feel like a complete tit for not knowing how to do that, but in my defence, the amount of downloads suggest that 19 others must have been just as clueless as me <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/rofl.png?v=5" title=":rofl:" class="emoji" alt=":rofl:"></p>

<p>It was the lack of that math object after the scrub dial that had me stumped.<br>Love the way the smoothing works as well, simple but cool, cheers!</p>

<p>a couple of observations:</p>

<p>you absolutely need the smooth object, otherwise it sounds like garbage even with interpolated read. adjust the smooth object to get kind of a slurry response (like on a vinyl player that slows down) put it to zero to get immediate response.</p>

<p>table length is an issue. if your raw file is not exactly table length in size the end of your knob will be silent. i added a max position multiplier that can adjust the knob range, as of now that is manually done (listen to it and adjust accordingly)</p>

              <p>Thanks for the responses, but is there any chance I could see a basic setup?</p>

<p>It would save me hours or maybe even days of having to rip my hair out, and just to be clear, although it would be cool to see how it's done, I'm not talking about the inertia or ballistics that are involved then a real vinyl is spinning.  I literally just want to map the minimum value of a knob to the start of a sample, and the maximum value to the end so that no matter what length the sample is, I can scrub through it start to end in forward or reverse using a knob.</p>

<p>Encoders are a big no for the sort of thing I mean, but again, even an example of that would be great, anything to put me (and anyone else who's curious) on the right track.</p>

<p>So I'm after a crisp, exact response to turning the knob, it should feel like the sample is directly connected to the knob.  The standard resolution of MIDI should be no problem, cause if it works ok, I hope to rig-up a physical analogue pot to it, hopefully an industrial grade one that will take a super-sized knob to make in nice to use.</p>

<p>If you have a MIDI controller than supports it, there's a 14-bit MIDI CC object, I think.</p>

<p>That's higher-resolution than the 12-bit DACs you'd be using if you hooked up a pot directly to an Axoloti pin.</p>

              <p>I'm curious, has anyone created a sample scrubber patch (or dedicated object) that lets you attach, say a knob, and directly scrub backwards and forwards by twisting it, like the effect you get when scrubbing (scratching) on vinyl?</p>

<p>What I'm after is a very basic sample player, without any of the granular stuff, I just want the knob to directly play the sample as I spin it back and forth, and for the sample to change pitch according to the twisting of the knob speed.  And, for the sample to start (and stay) at whatever position the knob last stopped moving.</p>

<p>Basically, a sample version of vinyl being forced backward and forward.</p>

<p>I can't try anything at the moment as I don't have Axoloti installed on this system.  But I'm preparing a Linux box especially for Axoloti and other audio stuff, so I'll try anything and everything suggested once I have it up and running.</p>
