    <title>Embedding modules with headers in it (eg. triangle oscillator/mutable instruments))</title>

    <description>when embedding a module like the triangle oscillator or mutable instrument modules, you&#39;ll see that you actually can&#39;t get the code to run. In these cases you first need to save the module in you own home folder or contributions and add the header that&#39;s used in the module to the folder that the module is in (where you saved it to). Then you can edit the code and save it directly without actually embedding the module and keep it working.
As for the triangle oscillator, you&#39;ll need to copy the header in the oscillator folder that&#39;s about the blit-synthesis (bltable).

BUT I was wondering.. isn&#39;t it possible to still allow these modules to be editted the &quot;normal way&quot; by just embedding the module? Perhaps by making a dedicated &quot;header&quot; folder where all modules will look when they need a header?

Where is an embedded module looking for headers anyways? I expected it to be the patch-folder as that is where the &quot;object&quot; module is at, but copying the bltable to it still doesn&#39;t enable the triangle oscillator to work when embedded..</description>

              <p>If the object is embedded, it doesnÂ¨t have an actual location, so Axoloti doesn't know where to look for the header file. I think that is basically it. Yeah you might have several location for header files this way.</p>

<p>Just a quick thought, maybe you can use symbolic links? You have the headers in one location and then create a symbolic link for the second and third location and so on?</p>

              <p>oh wait.. I just memorised that the bltable is called at in the "includes" part of the code.<br>so..why is it we still can't edit the "includes" part of the overview?</p>

<p>ps. I still think a dedicated header folder might be a good idea. It's a bit pointless to have the same file in several seperate folders..</p>
