    <title>My first synth: jzsynth</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/my-first-synth-jzsynth/3176</link>
    <description>Hi folks! I&#39;ve made my first incredibly simple synth patch, and thought I&#39;d share it. I would love any advice or critiques on how to make it sound cooler.

It&#39;s a modification of the Minimoog setup -- 3 oscs (sin/tri/sqr/pwm) and pink noise, but with an additional sine suboscillator tuned down an octave. It routes like the Moog: oscs -&gt; vcf -&gt; vca, but there&#39;s an additional filter on the noise generator so you can filter it independently of the main filter, for weird sounds.

I&#39;ve got ADSR envelopes and LFOs for both VCA and VCF for fun. I think I&#39;d like to add a simple delay and Juno-style chorusing to it, but for now this is what I&#39;ve got as my startup patch on my Axoloti.

I know it&#39;s day one stuff, but it might be useful for someone else just starting out to figure out how to do things like have UI switches for oscillators, etc.

I&#39;m learning how to do hardware, and I&#39;m building a USB-MIDI interface for it with an Arduino that&#39;s got all my controls laid out the way I want them. It&#39;ll run into a Raspberry Pi that I&#39;ve got essentially summing up and displaying MIDI messages from my various controllers, since the Axoloti can&#39;t deal with MIDI devices on a hub. (Plus it displays the current control name and value, and the Pi&#39;s IP address, on an LCD.)

Lemme know if you dig it and how I might improve the sound!

[Edited to update patch because I somehow disconnected stuff and didn&#39;t notice.) :slight_smile:
