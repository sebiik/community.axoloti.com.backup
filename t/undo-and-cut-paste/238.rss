    <title>Undo and Cut/Paste</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/undo-and-cut-paste/238</link>
    <description>Just a couple of relatively minor issues with the software:

1 - an undo/redo feature would be really useful

2- Keyboard shortcuts for Copy&gt;Paste don&#39;t work. At least not on my PC running Windows 8.1. It works fine if I use the menu but keyboard shortcuts are a lot quicker.

Other than those two little niggles I am loving it all. Got a Bugbrand Boardweevil going into some pulsing ring-mod tones and it sounds fantastic!</description>

              <p>Undo/Redo can be a tricky to implement...</p>

<p>i wonder if an intermediate step might be 'snapshots', essentially this can be a simple 'versioned' copy of the patch,<br>(stored this in the same patch file?).</p>

<p>this has two useful functions<br>a) you can save a snapshot, whilst you try something out... and then go back if it doesn't work out. in this way, its kind of like undo.<br>b) you can save slightly different versions of a patch e.g. variations on a theme.</p>

<p>we can apply some handy 'shortcut' keys/ dropdown etc to move between snapshots.<br>(obviously this is all only done whilst not 'live')</p>

<p>so I think even if you have undo, it will still serve a useful purpose.</p>

<p>just an idea, to compete with the 100's we already have <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile"></p>

              <p>Good, I guess, to hear that it is not just me...Just tried a few times now and had similar results as last night; sometimes it works fine, others not. When it doesn't work no error message is thrown. At first I was certain that it was dependent on where you click to select and object but now I am not so sure...I will keep an eye on it, and if I do see any kind of consistent reason why it doesn't always work, I will let you know.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> good to hear an Undo feature will be implemented at some point. No real rush, and it was definitely the right call not to delay release!

<blockquote><p>I think it may depend on where you click on an object</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>there are some oddities to copy / paste , sometimes it just does do anything, sometimes it posts an error in the console, unfortunately Ive not been able to find an exact sequence of events to reproduce this.</p>

<p>if you can find a way, that it always doesn't work let me know, and will see if I can fix. (I'll try the example you mention later..)<br>btw, if you do find a scenario, it would be good to know exactly what happens e.g. error thrown or not, <br>also does the object get selected when you expect it to (dark border around object)</p>

<p>it would be nice to squash this, as it irritates me too <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile"></p>

              <p>I agree undo would be really useful. It is quite an involving change in code. If I had decided to make this a release feature, it would have delayed release significantly. It is certainly on my wishlist too, while I don't have an estimate of when it will be implemented, it will certainly not be forgotten.</p>

              <p>Thanks. Just checked and I have Java Version 8. Just been trying again and it does appear to be working. I think it may depend on where you click on an object - for instance if you click the Pitch label on a Filter to change the display type it does just that and does not select the object itself. Apologies for wasting your time with that one!</p>
