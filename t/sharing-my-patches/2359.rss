    <description>My patch collection will be shared in this post.

**LEAD - rebourne:**

Description: the aim was to let it sound like the hardstyle producer: &quot;rebourne&quot; does his synths, and to be honest, i&#39;m quite satisfied with just one axoloti in making the sound.

Features: it has multiple oscillators, 3 polyvoice, uses ~90% DSP, nearly all the ram, and has a massive sound :slight_smile:

**LEAD - Hardstyler:**

Description: the aim was to let it sound like a nice stereo hardstyle lead. play with the filter sustain to fade between a pluck and a lead

Features: it has multiple saw, supersaw and square oscillators, 4 polyvoice, uses ~78% DSP, ~30k ram, and has a massive stereo sound. also included is my &#39;soundgood&#39; module to fatten it up.

**LEAD - PHD:**

Description: the aim was to let it sound like the song &quot;I won&#39;t let you down&quot; by PH.D.

Features: it has 2 supersaws and one regular saw oscillators per voice, 6 polyvoice, uses ~94% DSP, nearly all the ram, and has a close to original sound.

**INSTRUMENT - Metal Guitar:**

Description: the aim was to create a nice sounding metal-like guitar with FM and distortions.

Features: it has quite some FM going on and alot of distortion, thus allowing only 2 voices, but sounds rather nice for &#39;just&#39; 168MHZ of DSP power. uses ~95% DSP and nearly all the ram.

**INSTRUMENT - Dark panflute:**

Description: a simple, nice sounding panflute, soundas a little on the dark side. :stuck_out_tongue: 

Features: it has quite some square osc&#39;s going on, eq and some reverb, thus allowing 5 voices, but sounds rather nice. uses ~88% DSP and nearly all the ram.
