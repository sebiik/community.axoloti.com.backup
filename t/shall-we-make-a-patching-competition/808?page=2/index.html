<p>I think we can also have perhaps a post which people can submit ideas for the monthly competitions, though its the winners choice, nice to have a pool of ideas</p>

<p>Then I guess we just need to kick it off with a post "Monthly Patch - Jan 2016" <br><a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> perhaps you could do the honour of kicking this off... but if you don't fancy or don't have time etc, then I nominate <a class="mention" href="/users/sputnki">@Sputnki</a> </p>

<p>fyi, how to create a poll is detailed here:<br><a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse/wiki/Poll-Plugin-Usage" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://github.com/discourse/discourse/wiki/Poll-Plugin-Usage</a></p>

<p>I propose "noodler patches" as a theme: mostly self-playing improvisation patches, say, maximum 2 parameters for real time composition control.</p>

        <p>as we know what the comp is for this month, I've created a topic... also hopefully can be used as a kind of 'template' for following months.<br><a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a>  Ive included what I think was your intention but it would be great if you could check/edit, and also 'take ownership' (admin menu) </p>

<p>a couple of points as i was doing it...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>submission window<br>I've moved the submission window forward to end of month, as otherwise it didn't really feel like a competition for January. so Ive gone for last 3 days in month, then voting in the first 5 days of following month.</p></li>
<li><p>voting criteria<br>I think for some (not necessarily all) challenges, the challenger might want to 'suggest' aspects of the patches they think are 'in the spirit' of the challenge when being voted for.<br>e.g. in this months challenge, its got a kind of generative focus, but as samples are not allowed, this means some kind of synthesis is allowed.<br>this poses an interesting question... which is 'better' an elaborate composition patch, or a very simple one with a really nice synthesised sound.... I don't know the answer to this question, and perhaps its open i.e. what ever the voter likes ... (which would be a valid voting criteria)<br>It could be this is also unnecessary, and perhaps could be clearer in the challenge description, or more focused in the constraints placed on the challenge. In this particular case Im not the challenger, so Ive only put the minimum details so as not to add my own 'flavour'  to it, so perhaps this is the problem</p></li>
</ul>

<p>rules...  I thought of something that perhaps should be made 'clear'</p>

<p>I think (discuss <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> ) its perfectly acceptable (and a good idea!) to use other peoples patches (whole/part/modified) in your submissions - but I think 'credit' should be given when this is the case. (author/link to topic?)<br>Its good to allow, much creativity is built on others...but crediting means voters can go back to original source, and of course its 'courtesy' <br>... of course some discretion here, e.g. unnecessary for things from factory, or small part of a patch that is then modified -  Im more thinking entire voices / sequencers / fx.<br>(for challenges which include samples or similar, probably a similar disclosure would be a good idea - useful so we know its not copyrighted material as much as anything) <br>... its not something we need to 'police', after all the 're-use' is allowed, but just encourage from the outset.</p>

        <p>I'd like to propose a new theme for the next challenge: lifeforms.<br>the goal is to design a patch that resembles some kind of ecosystem, with one (or several) lifeforms that interact with each other.</p>

<p>As for the constraints: there should be some button to restart the simulation from zero, and eventually some parameters to alter the starting conditions of the system.</p>

<p>What do you think? Is it rocket science to do?</p>
