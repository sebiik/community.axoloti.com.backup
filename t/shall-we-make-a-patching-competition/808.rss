    <title>Shall we make a patching competition?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/shall-we-make-a-patching-competition/808</link>
    <description>You know, a new year is beginning and the community is almost 1 year old! And therefore is obviously time for a patching competition! 

I was thinking about something like this: a competition &quot;theme&quot; is decided with a public poll (something like kick drum synthesis or evolving soundscapes or granular synthesis) and anyone who wants to partecipate has to keep his work &quot;secret&quot; (not sharing it with the community) until the competition ends, in order not to bias other partecipants or the jury.

Patches are submitted to a jury (it could be like 3-4 users) that has to rate several factors, such as (for example)
-relevancy with the theme
-sound goodness
-patch tidyness 
-creativity award 

In the end an average vote is calculated and the winner wins something (prize is yet to be decided)

Patches can then be published and displayed to the community.

What do you think?</description>

              <p>as we know what the comp is for this month, I've created a topic... also hopefully can be used as a kind of 'template' for following months.<br><a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a>  Ive included what I think was your intention but it would be great if you could check/edit, and also 'take ownership' (admin menu) </p>

<p>a couple of points as i was doing it...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>submission window<br>I've moved the submission window forward to end of month, as otherwise it didn't really feel like a competition for January. so Ive gone for last 3 days in month, then voting in the first 5 days of following month.</p></li>
<li><p>voting criteria<br>I think for some (not necessarily all) challenges, the challenger might want to 'suggest' aspects of the patches they think are 'in the spirit' of the challenge when being voted for.<br>e.g. in this months challenge, its got a kind of generative focus, but as samples are not allowed, this means some kind of synthesis is allowed.<br>this poses an interesting question... which is 'better' an elaborate composition patch, or a very simple one with a really nice synthesised sound.... I don't know the answer to this question, and perhaps its open i.e. what ever the voter likes ... (which would be a valid voting criteria)<br>It could be this is also unnecessary, and perhaps could be clearer in the challenge description, or more focused in the constraints placed on the challenge. In this particular case Im not the challenger, so Ive only put the minimum details so as not to add my own 'flavour'  to it, so perhaps this is the problem</p></li>
</ul>

<p>rules...  I thought of something that perhaps should be made 'clear'</p>

<p>I think (discuss <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> ) its perfectly acceptable (and a good idea!) to use other peoples patches (whole/part/modified) in your submissions - but I think 'credit' should be given when this is the case. (author/link to topic?)<br>Its good to allow, much creativity is built on others...but crediting means voters can go back to original source, and of course its 'courtesy' <br>... of course some discretion here, e.g. unnecessary for things from factory, or small part of a patch that is then modified -  Im more thinking entire voices / sequencers / fx.<br>(for challenges which include samples or similar, probably a similar disclosure would be a good idea - useful so we know its not copyrighted material as much as anything) <br>... its not something we need to 'police', after all the 're-use' is allowed, but just encourage from the outset.</p>

<p>I think we can also have perhaps a post which people can submit ideas for the monthly competitions, though its the winners choice, nice to have a pool of ideas</p>

<p>Then I guess we just need to kick it off with a post "Monthly Patch - Jan 2016" <br><a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> perhaps you could do the honour of kicking this off... but if you don't fancy or don't have time etc, then I nominate <a class="mention" href="/users/sputnki">@Sputnki</a> </p>

              <p>Yeah, I think we can all agree, that given Axolotl's wide spectrum of uses, each month could (should?) be very different, be in synthesis, sampling, granular... sequencing midi? etc etc.<br>Id guess some will enter for themes that interest them, and others might enter all (time permitting) to 'grow' in different areas. </p>

<p>Id say, lets just 'give it a go' and see what works (and doesnt) as we go along.</p>

<p>so <a class="mention" href="/users/mtyas">@mtyas</a> said 20 days?  + 3 days to submit + 1 week voting...<br>how do we want to do this? fixed dates, so easy to remember ? <br>e.g. 1st-3rd = submission, 4th-10th voting, 11th = competition set, 11th-month end =patching?<br>any other suggestions?</p>

<p>I can create a new category, so we have it all in one place.</p>

<p>Id suggest the competition 'setter' opens a new topic on the 11th, opening post contains the themes/constraints... and later (on the 4th) contains the 'vote' poll<br>I think it would be good if the 'competition setter' can do the 'admin' for the competition that month, by that i mean, create the poll form the submissions, and also clarify theme/constraints during the month.</p>

<p>(in the competition category, we can also keep discussions about theme/constraints suggestions, tip n tricks and any 'rule' proposals) </p>

<p>I think we can give it a crack this month, perhaps with an 'easier challenge' to start, don't want to frighten anybody away... participation is the most important part.</p>

<p>I agree, that it would be great if <a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> would be willing to kick us off with an opening challenge <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>Yes sure, but I guess there is a natural limit of how much Axoloti will play at the same time. One competition cold be; Create a whole song/loop of this sample: X.wav. That is possible <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>My prefered use of axoloti is for samples, so no samples would be a turn off for me <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>Anyway, we could have a few test runs and se how it goes and sets some rules if it gets too abstract <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> I think it is "dangerous" setting general rules for creative processes as music is. But that doessnt mean that each competition can have specific rules. That would be better imo than general rules.</p>

<p>Cool with me about the runner up chooses if the winner also won last competition.</p>

              <p>I think a bit of restraining is necessary for a competition. There's a lot of space in the forum for publishing patches without a volume limiter before the output, or with hundreds of subpatches to download (and a lot of users do this). But for a competition, especially because there is not a jury, constraints are necessary in order to make the review process the most quick and safe possible.</p>

<p>A limit on end-user control means that as a reviewer i won't start from a bass patch and tweak 1000 parameters until i can review a pad. Unless that's the theme of the competition.</p>

              <p>yeah, whilst I think we shouldn't be prescriptive about how patches have to be constructed etc... </p>

<p>and I suspect it will to some extend be 'self policing' if people submit patches which are difficult to install, or difficult to use... i suspect many will just not bother, so will get lower votes.... <br>(e.g. I for one will not be downloading GB's of samples, and messing about with external hosts. so thats a hint for getting my vote <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> )</p>

<p>perhaps we should have a 'tips n tricks' section for patches, that make them 'easier' for people to install...</p>

<p>Id add to yours...<br>- use patch/patcher rather than sub-patches, so its all in one patch file<br>- ensure everything uses relative paths<br>- a preset or two which show the patch in different 'states'<br>- YT/soundclound mp3 link so voters can hear patch example in advance.</p>

<p>winner chooses theme and constraints sounds good to me, with an 'exception' ... if they win their own competition, then the runner up chooses.</p>

<p>I think we should define some standards for patches to be presented in, for example a master volume control ( *c or vca could do the trick) that's well visible (and possibly set to 0 by default) should exist in every competitor patch, in order to protect ears and speakers.</p>

<p>Also i'd say to limit "end user control" to a maximum of N parameters, well visible and commented at the top of the patch. (The number of parameters depends clearly on the theme)</p>

<p>the poll plugin is already installed, so you can create polls like this</p>

<p> </p>

<p>doesn't allow weighting..., though I suppose we could do 3 polls (in the same post), for first, second and third choice (one vote) then its trivial, to calculate the points</p>

              <p>I think 1st of February to start the 1st competition seems a good date to start off.</p>

<p> If every participant gets to openly vote for the top 3 (with 5 points for the 1st, 3 points for the 2nd and 2 points for the 3rd, or something like that) on a forum thread, I think we can work out the winner. I'm sure we're only talking about 10-20 people maximum for the moment, and finding just 4 people to vote (so that means they cannot participate) won't be easy (at least for the moment)</p>

<p>I wouldn't ban samples, because it would stop us having fun with wavetables. So why not just limit all samples to a certain size (5Mb max) and oblige them to be open source (so making one's own is the best idea).</p>

<p>Otherwise self contained patches of course, and maybe encourage a certain amount of description in the patch too.</p>

<p>I like the idea that our dear president [sic] choses the first theme. If he doesn't want to, we've always got time to do a "proposition -&gt; poll" function before starting</p>

              <p>I like the idea!</p>

<p>my preference would be for  a competition with community voting, no prizes just for fun... and people just vote how they see fit, say top 3. or even better just comment on what they like about submissions (feedback is the most valuable reward I think)</p>

<p>I agree with others, no jury, and keep it simple/lightweight .... just a theme and a 'deadline' and then a voting window. <br>(the community is relatively small, and for many time is precious, so have to keep barriers to minimum)</p>

<p>btw: I think perhaps if submissions contained a video/soundcloud as well as patch might promote browsing a bit more.<br>similarly patches should be self contained, so use patch/patcher as the new UI allows direct loading from a URL.</p>

<p>one thing we might need to be careful of is 'samples' given potential copyright issues, and also 'storage' requirements on the server. I guess if submissions contained links to (free) downloads thats works.</p>

              <p>I get what you're saying, but having a jury means a more consistent voting (say everybody wants to test A's patch, because he is a very active and well known user, while nobody wants to test B's patch, because he is a noob, the resoult would be biased)</p>

<p>In my experience, in a small community (about videogame making, but the number of active users was comparable) competitions would end with 7-8 entries and 3-4 judges and the review process would end in approx. 2 weeks.</p>
