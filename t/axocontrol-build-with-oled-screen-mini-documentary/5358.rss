    <title>Axocontrol build with OLED screen mini-documentary</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/axocontrol-build-with-oled-screen-mini-documentary/5358</link>
    <description>Hello friends. I recently documented the experience of building an enclosure for the Axoloti Core, Axocontrol, and an OLED screen, and even though it&#39;s small potatoes compared to the types of projects I see others around here creating, I still wanted to share it because I am very happy with the results.

Please take a look and enjoy, if you should be so kind.

              <p>Another way to look at it. All the identifiers around the pots, switches, etc. NEED to be soldered. So, I’d print the schematic, and use a highlighter to mark all the pins on the connector which are referenced elsewhere.</p>

<p>Actually, I’d suggest careful soldering, rather than trying to solder minimally. You might want to buy a bag of connectors, and some cheap boards, and practice. I can’t imagine botching one of these, but I’ve been soldering forever.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the link <a class="mention" href="/u/tele_player">@tele_player</a>. My understanding of schematics is a bit basic but do I take it that any of the pins in the 40-pin strip that don't have a label are not connected to anything within the rest of the pcb and therefore don't need to be soldered? </p>

<p>How about any of the connections that don't feature anywhere else in the schematic? For instance, PC4, PC5, PB6 and PB7 only seem to appear on the 40-pin connector and don't seem to be linked to any of the other components. Can I leave those unsoldered too?</p>

<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

              <p>Great video! I have watched it several times in preparation for having a second go at building my Axocontrol. Messed up one kit with poor soldering. In the video, you talk about finding out that a lot of the connections on the 40-pin connector are superfluous. Have you got a list/diagram you could share which shows just those pins that are actually used by the Axocontrol board, please? That way, I don't need to solder those connections that are unused. Thanks.</p>
