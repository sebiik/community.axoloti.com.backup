    <description>Hello !

Im looking for objects / patch to do the following:

3 channel sample player that can either play longish samples with random stuff from the card or sample live input and play that, the thing is i still cant find any solution to get looping working, it seems that the factory table/play pitch loop thing doesnt actually loop, is there any other solution nowdays ? id like it to loop kind of relatively to the lenght of the sample that its playing, is this possible ? like i could have a player with preselected 20sec sample with many things after eachother and then play this with 1 button and play with the start and loop points, and then record a 2 sec sample from the input and the start, loop, loop lenght etc controls could still work but in the scale of the 2 sec sample.. there is some objects in the rbrt looper folder that look like they could do this kind of things but i really cant figure how to use them.. is there any example patches somewhere with those ?

thanks and sorry for the messy text.

<p>Yes, there are ways to do it, but no one seems to speak about it, probably due to things not being optimised for doing this stuff with SD audio read/write.  Those threads I pointed out are basically me trying (and failing badly), to get someone to talk/do/show/demonstrate or whatever.  We're in the hands of the devs and contributors to improve this area Axoloti, so all we can do is hope that it will happen some day.</p>

              <p>yes, my friend helped me to do a nice patch that kind of works as i wanted, using the rbrt/looper/ldrive object.<br>but what i came against is the memory, i didnt know its so limited, is there any way to play samples from not sdram but some other, ram ? sd card? directly with the tables.. i see there is table/alloc things that are not sdram but not one that would let me to select a file directly..</p>

Funny thing is, I can tell from what you write, what you're going to come up against next.  Even the stuff you mention in your recent reply, about working with position, I started a thread on that too cause I'm completely clueless about it, but there was no response, again, no doubt because working with this stuff is not really ironed out yet.</p>

<p>Here's the thread I mean, you'll notice it's not exactly the same as what you're requesting, but technically what I'm asking would allow us to achieve the same sort of operations in the Axoloti Patcher environment:</p>

    Imagine the most simple sampling patch ever, where all it does is record to a table and let you play it back. 

Easy enough, but now I want to add two dials to it, one to set the playback Start point of the sample, and one to set the Stop point.  Then, I want to be able to discard the waveform data that falls outside the Start and Stop points so that I can save the resulting sample to the SC card.

              <p>Thanks ! i checked the scrub patch, and its not what im after exactly but it made me understand a bit about the table/read things for the first time.. it makes some sense now, for example now the rbrt/looper/ldrive loop object seems quite promising for my use according the parameters, but how should i connect that ? if i connect the red "pos" out to the table read i get some noise. hmm..</p>

              <p>Don't have my Axo set up at the moment so can't check, but if I recall, the Sample-Scrubber example that lokki made for me demonstrated a loop also.  Don't quote me on that, I know something I asked for did and I think that might be the one, but if not, at least it will teach you how to do sample-scrubbing really easily!</p>

    I'm curious, has anyone created a sample scrubber patch (or dedicated object) that lets you attach, say a knob, and directly scrub backwards and forwards by twisting it, like the effect you get when scrubbing (scratching) on vinyl? 

What I'm after is a very basic sample player, without any of the granular stuff, I just want the knob to directly play the sample as I spin it back and forth, and for the sample to change pitch according to the twisting of the knob speed.  And, for the sample to staâ€¦

<p>Regards working with longer samples from the card, I hear it can be done somehow but I asked about this not so long ago and no one seems interested in this at the moment.  I think the problem is the current situation is not ideal and I get the feeling the members here who code objects are steering clear of coding such objects until some technical changes are made to the way things are done.</p>

<p>I've wanted to make a digital SD-Card based recorder for example, and can't because there are no full-duplex objects around yet.  I believe things need to be super-optimised in order to do this stuff on Axoloti and have asked for super-optimised full-duplex objects.  The good news is I did get a response from King Axoloti once, but none of us know if or when this stuff will arrive.  I've always been surprised that out of all the coders and contributors on here, none have designed dedicated super-optimised full-duplex objects, but they haven't, so I've just had to accept it ain't gonna happen until changes are put in place to how things work.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's the thread if you're curious:<br><aside class="quote" data-post="1" data-topic="3067">

    I've been reading-up on the status regards Axoloti recording/playback to/from SD card. 

As far as I can tell, that area is a bit hit and miss right now.  I'd love to build a multi-track recorder, and while it sounds as if that's already possible, I also get the impression that full-duplex operations using the SD card are not refined enough yet.  So personally, I would love to see that sort of stuff getting more attention.  I think as long as it's capable of recording at least two mono tracks ofâ€¦
