    <title>Question about filters</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/question-about-filters/3656</link>
    <description>Hi!
I hope this is the place to ask about this.
Maybe this has been discussed, but I have been searching in the forum and I didn&#39;t find anything.
The thing is in all the patches I have made, whenever I use the LP filter it sounds good as long as I don&#39;t touch the resonance. 
In every synth I have played with, the resonance in a lp filter amplifies (this may not tecnically be the word, english is not my first language) the filter frequence, and cuts off whatever is above.
I axoloti&#39;s LP filter, it seems that the higher you turn the resonance knob, the less present are the rest of the frequencies below it. 
I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m explaining this well, maybe I can explain it better with some images:
http://imgur.com/a/vH0pk
In image one, resonance is at 0. Everything is ok.
In image two, resonance is at 45. The frequency of the filter is unaltered, while whatever is below it is less present.
In image three, resonance is at 60. At this point you can only hear the frequency the filter is at, while the rest is very weak.

Is there a reason for this?
Is there a workaround so I can get the effect I get in other synths?
Has anybody uploaded some awesome sounding filters I haven&#39;t found yet?

Edit: I think I posted it in the wrong place after all, moving it to Patching.</description>

              <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/ttotelka">@TTotelka</a>,</p>

<p>The resonance may also decay in the high frequencies with some designs.</p>

<p>Here are the filters with resonance i have implemented so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/tiar-smashedtransistors-contributions/2737/39?u=smashedtransistors">ZDF SVF 1</a><br>try the help file to get an idea of how it can sound: <br><em>menu bar: <strong>Help</strong> -&gt; Library -&gt; Community -&gt; tiar -&gt; filter -&gt; ZDF SVF 1</em><br>It can combine high res and deep and fast modulation.</p></li>
<li><p>The ZDF SVF 2 is a variant capable of audio rate modulation.. quite experimental.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As mentioned <a class="mention" href="/u/jaffasplaffa">@jaffasplaffa</a> these filters are based on the classic SVF structure (two integrators state variable filters) and they are nice "screamers".</p>

<ul><li>Maybe you can also try the <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/tiar-smashedtransistors-contributions/2737/86?u=smashedtransistors">MgExp</a><br>You can try <em><strong>Menu bar</strong> Help -&gt; Library -&gt; Community -&gt; tiar -&gt; filters -&gt; MgExp.axh</em><br>it is a 24dB filter with resonance, it is still work in progress, so if you have issues with it, let me know <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">

<p>I hope you find what you are looking for. That filter is pretty good. If the SVF filter doesnt do the job check some of the filters by sirsicksik. His name is "sss" in the community library. There are many filters to choose from in his filter folder.</p>

<p>But as you say you are new to this, the point I made with always trying out a few different things is important to make the best of it <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>To find the <a class="mention" href="/u/smashedtransistors">@SmashedTransistors</a> filter look for "tiar" in the community library. That is is name in there..</p>

I'll check out more filters. I had been looking at the community stuff, but as you can see my knowledge in this stuff is limited, and "multimode svf m" didn't sound like a filter to me, so I guess I skipped that one, and many others XD</p>

<p>Thanks to both!</p>

<p>Maybe try another filter? I would give the filter/multimode svf m filter a try, I like that one. For the SVF filter be careful how high volume signal you send through it, cause it reacts to that. Really loud sounds can make it behave a bit strange and make it sound really digital. Actually there are also better version of this filter in the community library. I think <a class="mention" href="/u/smashedtransistors">@SmashedTransistors</a> have made an oversampled version of it. It is definitely a lot easier to get a more "screaming" resonance from svf filter than for the one you have used in the picture.</p>

<p> Anyway, there are many filters in the community library and not all of them reacts/sounds the same way. So my advice is check some of the filters from the library out and see what you like. This is a general advice when working with Axoloti: ALWAYS try out a few different objects before settling for something. Or try a few different methods of doing the same thing.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Cranking the resonance in many topologies (analogue too, if you think about the 303 filter) leads to an attenuation of non resonating frequencies. This is the case of axoloti filter implementation (biquadratic). You could put a vca before the filter and attenuate the signal at low resonance, then apply gain after the filter</p>
