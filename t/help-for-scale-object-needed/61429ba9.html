<p>if you have had a post deleted, please take a second to re-read the FAQ, <br>particularly the sections below from the <a href="../../faq.html">Axoloti Forum FAQ</a></p>

<p>we are here to build a friendly community, keeping it a friendly place will allow it to flourish -  creating animosity will slowly destroy it.<br>its simple, be nice to each other... and if you don't like something that someone says flag it.. do NOT respond - be part of the solution, not part of the problem.</p>

<p>as a small note, it probably would have been better to start a new topic for a discussion on 'generative music'.</p>

<p><aside class="quote"><blockquote>
<h3>Be Agreeable, Even When You Disagree</h3>
<p>You may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. That‚Äôs fine. But, remember to criticize ideas, not people. Please avoid:</p>
<p>Name-calling.<br>Ad hominem attacks.<br>Responding to a post‚Äôs tone instead of its actual content.<br>Knee-jerk contradiction.<br>Instead, provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation.</p>
<h3>If You See a Problem, Flag It</h3>
<p>Moderators have special authority; they are responsible for this forum. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.</p>
<p>When you see bad behavior, don‚Äôt reply. It encourages the bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone‚Äôs time. Just flag it. If enough flags accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention.</p>
<p>In order to maintain our community, moderators reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time. Moderators do not preview new posts in any way; the moderators and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community.</p>
<h3>Always Be Civil</h3>
<p>Nothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:</p>
<p>Be civil. Don‚Äôt post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.<br>Keep it clean. Don‚Äôt post anything obscene or sexually explicit.<br>Respect each other. Don‚Äôt harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information.<br>Respect our forum. Don‚Äôt post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum.<br>These are not concrete terms with precise definitions ‚Äî avoid even the appearance of any of these things. If you‚Äôre unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of the New York Times.</p>
<p>This is a public forum, and search engines index these discussions. Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.</p>
