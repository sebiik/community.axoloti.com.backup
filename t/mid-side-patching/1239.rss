    <title>Mid/side patching</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/mid-side-patching/1239</link>
    <description>Hello!
I was curious on Mid/side manipulation to be able to get more possibilities out of a simple stereo channel output.
My idea was to hard pan some sounds and other sounds are just centered, and by Mid/side techniques attempting to get three channels out of the two!

Has anyone attempted this and can share experiences? I&#39;ll have at it tonight and see how far I go. =)</description>
