    <title>Could OSC protocol be integrated in axoloti?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/could-osc-protocol-be-integrated-in-axoloti/3499</link>
    <description>Hi everyone,

This is my second post in this community, for now I’m not a axoloti owner, I’m just taking notes of what I could do with it, I’ll buy it pretty soon. 

I’m a max/msp and puredata and Lemur user and a thing That I really like with all these tools is the OSC protocol. 
I read [this thread](http://community.axoloti.com/t/ableton-link-axoloti/2239/4) thinking about it, but I haven’t found more recent discussions about it.

It’s not only a software matter but also a hardware matter since you need wifi or ethernet to transmit the datas (I’ve been wondering a bit about the place I could post it btw). 

So I have two questions :

• Can we imagine a ethernet port for the axoloti in the near future ? (wich could receive from a wifi router osc data for example) or there’s also the esp8266 solution ( saw in the [same thread](http://community.axoloti.com/t/ableton-link-axoloti/2239/4) ) receiving wifi.

• Are some osc object could be develop in axoloti (supposing we could receive data via wifi or ethernet ?) ?

I’m using osc with my smartphones and ipad to control max msp patches on my mac with a adhoc network, it’s really useful especially when you can take advantage of smartphones sensor (accelerometer, touch screen). 

For example drawing a wavetable with an ipad touchscreen could be really nice, Fairlight style (but I don’t know if the wavetable is editable in realtime on the axoloti for now).

I can’t wait to play with axoloti !</description>

              <p>Usually it’s used over a network, WiFi/Ethernet and it’s probably quite a bit work of to get the whole network stack - not sure if stm has some of it or not.   </p>

<p>Osc could be used over a serial connection , something I discussed recently with  johannes , as a way to expose parameters , but it’s pretty heavy for an embedded system, binary protocols like those in Axoloti are much lighter/more efficienct.<br>But the disadvantage is obviously you need to have dedicated encoders/decoders.</p>
