    <title>Adding an expression pedal input</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/adding-an-expression-pedal-input/3513</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m about to do my first modification to my axoloti. I plan on hooking up inputs for an expression pedal and sustain pedal. I&#39;m pretty sure the sustain pedal is straight forward, being just a switch, but I want to make sure about the expression pedal. I have an m-audio EX-P (supposedly this is the [Schematic](http://joflaherty.org/MidiExprPedal/Expression%20Pedal%20Schematic.png) if it helps). 

If I solder the leads from the stereo connector to the axoloti, will it be good to go? I have the Getting Started With Axoloti book which says &quot;Any potentiometer with a value between 2.2 kOhm and 47 kOhm with a linear taper&quot; is okay. According to that schematic is has a 12k pot, so maybe it&#39;s okay, but there is that low limit pot that&#39;s 50k too...</description>

              <p>Thanks for the reassurance! It seemed like it'd be fine, but it's been quite a while since I dabbled in electronics... And yeah I'm using 1/4 inch input jacks, mono for the sustain and stereo for the exp.</p>

<p>Thanks for writing the book, btw!</p>

              <p>I wouldn't solder it directly to the Axoloti. Best to buy a stereo female jack to solder to the Axoloti so you can still use your pedal with other things. I wouldn't worry too much about the 50k pot, it should work. The values I've used in the book are the ones Johannes suggested on the forum when he first shared the basic schematics on how to connect things.</p>

<p>Guess this will be how you need to connect everything to the Axoloti:</p>

<p>Black wire: GND<br>Red wire: VDDA<br>White wire: Analog input</p>
