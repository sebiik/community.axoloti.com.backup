    <title>Need a little bit of help with usin array [i] to create multiple filters!</title>

    <description>Hello!

I am trying to learn a bit about how to use [i] to create multiple filters out of the same lines of code. I am not sure what the name of this is, sorry.

I basically want to make 6 bandpass filters, that share the same input, but has individual outputs.

I&#39;ve tried setting it up, so I only have to write the code once and then use [i] to set how many filter I actually want.

I am down to a couple of errors now, which I am not sure how to fix, so I was hoping that someone
might have some suggestions on what can be done to fix it. AxoLOG;

As far as I know I have all ready initialised the band[i] that gives and error. In init i have this:
       
     for(i=0;i&lt;6;i++){
        low[i] = 0;
        band[i] = 0;
        }

Not sure where to go from here.

Here is the patch if anyone would be so kind at take a look at it:

Thanks, and happy easter :hatched_chick:</description>
