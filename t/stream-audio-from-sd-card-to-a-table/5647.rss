    <title>Stream audio from sd card to a table</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/stream-audio-from-sd-card-to-a-table/5647</link>
    <description>So trying to find a way to do glitchless sample loading into a table i had the idea of simply using the wave/play object to overwrite the table in the background, since this streaming function doesn&#39;t interrupt the audio stream as the table/load does.

It&#39;s working really nicely so far, obviously you might get some other glitchy sounds while the table is being overwritten but most times it&#39;s fast enough to be inaudible, and even if you hear something weird for 1-2 notes it&#39;s still much better than the half second complete dropout table/load causes.

Here&#39;s a screenshot of my test setup, i guess it would be neat to include the wave/play and table/record part into a single oject but this works for me for now.

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3308ce0f45f599fbfc09152c48299c8061ebee42.png&quot; width=&quot;564&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;

maybe someone has ideas on how to improve this? eg. Is there an easy way to stream from SD at a faster speed? Right now the whole table is being overwritten in realtime which is not ideal of course.

I still want to include the filesize somehow to maybe flush the unused end of the table with zeros, and also currently fixing the table/pitch play loop object so the loop actually works and it has an inlet for sample length as opposed to table length.

edit:
oh i just had an idea. i could create a buffer table, same size, stream into that, and on completion just swap the tables/table content. this would then have zero glitches, but at the same time it would take the whole sample length in time to load a new sound, instead of being instant with possible small glitches like the current solution.

edit:
can i do an amount n of simultaneous wave/play streams into several table/record of the same table, with the same pos offset of length/n for each wave/play and table/record? obvisouly the wave/play end outlets  would have to be adjusted.

              <p>those earlier ones were tests for something else that I couldn't get to work.

<p>the tablestream/streamplay look great, especially for slicing loops?</p>

<p>Didn't have a chance to try in real life yet but your playertest objects looks just like a neat perfected version of my mess. Is that one new too? I only remember you having 2 wave objects before i synced today and now its 4 so not sure... Does it still stream to the table in realtime?</p>

              <p>I've modded the sample player to write to a table directly instead of the output buffer.<br>it's in sss/wave<br>also added a sample-index to load multiple sample unto the same table.<br>So the size-attribute sets the max sample-length and the samples-attribute sets the max amount of samples.<br>So total table size is samplelength*samples.<br>To select a sample, just give the readposition an offset by multiplying the index with sample length, eg:<br>readpos=(readpos+1)&amp;LENGTHMASK;<br>sample=(inlet_sample&amp;(attr_table.SAMPLES-1))*attr_table.LENGTH; (attr_table.SAMPLES is the amount of samples set in the table)<br>outlet_out=array[readpos+sample];</p>

<p>running a breakcore pattern now, just randomising a random sample every beat.. no problems or glitches and tight clocking</p>

              <p>well one big table won't be enough for me i definately have to read from SD card, each of the 40-50 samples is about 1mb. that tcopy objects sounds interesting though, i would probably need that if i end up using a buffer table, ie. the glitchless but delayed option. right now i'm rolling with immediate &amp; glitches instead.<br>the streaming into a table solution is way better than regular table load for me even at this very basic stadium.</p>

<p>lol i even thought about getting an smd rework of the axo board since the SMT32F supports up to 64mb ram but yeah that would open another giant firmware rabbbithole...</p>

              <p>I am doing some stuff similar to what you are doing, using <a class="mention" href="/u/rbrt">@rbrt</a>'s rbrt/data/tcopy object, but it doesn't record the audio form table to table, it just copies it. I think it's better.</p>

<p>Example:<br>- Make a main table, where you have all the samples you want in a long file. Copy FROM this table.<br>- Make a buffer table, for playback. Copy TO this table<br>- When you want to load a new sample to the buffer table, you just copy it over from the main table to the buffer table, using the rbrt/data/tcopy object.</p>

<p>This is 100% click free and drop out free, no issues what so ever. But yeah, you would need to have that main table loaded all the time, into the SD-RAM.</p>
