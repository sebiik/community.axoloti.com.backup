    <title>Patch not starting on power-up</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/patch-not-starting-on-power-up/3209</link>
    <description>I&#39;m following the instructions here, for uploading a patch to internal flash...
https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/uploading-to-the-axoloti-hardware/60

I can&#39;t get the patch to run after powering down and back up. According to the instructions it should start automatically?

In case it was something about my patch (which runs fine in Live mode) I also checked using the tybett demo, and that didn&#39;t play either.

Thanks for suggestions!</description>

              <p>Thanks for the suggestion. The tybett example starts fine when running from sdcard. My looping file playback patch still isn't working. Want to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/kdmwdi30udqi510/loopingFilePlayback.axp?dl=1" rel="nofollow noopener">check it out to see if I'm doing something wrong</a>?</p>

<p>The patch depends on an initial loadbang to start the file player... perhaps I should put a delay on that to make sure it happens after the patch is fully loaded?</p>

    Overview

In the main user guide, we mentioned that taking a patch live in the Axoloti UI will upload it to the hardware. The Axoloti UI is where you build your patches, but it is not compulsary for using them. In this post we will be discussing how to use patches when not connected to a computer. 

Uploading firmware

Live

When we take a patch 'Live' we are uploading the patch to the Axoloti, and then maintaining a connection with this patch so that the UI can interact with it. e.g. by using tâ€¦
