    <title>Mouse commands from computer?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/mouse-commands-from-computer/3661</link>
    <description>Is there a way to get the direct mouse-commands from the computer, like &quot;left-button down&quot;?
eg. when you move a knob using the mouse, it also outputs a bool-high, showing you have the button pressed in. Would be nice for recorders when only using the mouse.</description>

              <p>ok, thanks for your reply.<br>For me personally it's no problem as I'm using a midi touch controller, so touching a slider also sends a pressure value which I can use as "record" trigger. But I was thinking about a module for people who don't have this option.</p>

              <p>So you could switch between recording and playback of parameter automation, by determining if the button is down?<br>I do not think it belongs to general parameters, the mouse is not the only way to change a parameter, could also be from a keystroke or midi etc... So it would introduce something that is not there in many cases, and behave unequally.<br>Implementing this would really demand GUI-side plugins, and while I'm interested in that concept, this will not go into the next release, sorry.</p>
