    <title>How to set-up 20Hz to 20kHz range on the filter dials?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/how-to-set-up-20hz-to-20khz-range-on-the-filter-dials/2978</link>
    <description>Another noob question!

I thought I&#39;d have a bash at a simple parametric equalizer yesterday, and noticed that the dials on the filter objects have a range of 8.176Hz to 13.29kHz.  I&#39;m curious about why that is, and what the best way is to make them 20Hz to 20kHz instead?

Please bear in mind that I&#39;m not a coder, I do design by wires :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:</description>

              <p>Ok thank you that works! I still have an increase in high frequencies with this filter set to 13k.</p>

It happened to me with my last gig that during soudncheck I look for problematic frequencies in the highs and I turn them down on my soundcard/mixer. <br>But then when I turn on the axoloti filter I get this boost in high frequencies and feedback starts again <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/grimacing.png?v=5" title=":grimacing:" class="emoji" alt=":grimacing:"><br>I can take down the frequencies again on my soundcard/mixer but this is far from perfect and I still had feedback coming when turning on the filters...</p>

<p>I think if we would have a full range the sound of these filters would be much more linear. It's incredible anyway that they don't go up fullrange and even more that nothing about this has changed in the 2,5 years that this thread is existing.</p>

<p>The big problem here is that I usually have on/off knobs for the filters and a lp filter set to 13k makes some coloration at 13k that is very audible. This thing is driving me crazy! I expect a Lp turned fully up to be more neutral.</p>

              <p>Thanks Remco, been at your ParaEQ almost all day, the explanation was clear and understood.</p>

<p>Gotta be brutally honest though, it really doesn't do what I'm expection it to do, and actually, it's way more sophisticated than I need which might be part of the problem.  I don't know why, but all of the EQ's I try seem very weak.  I don't know if it's just an accepted way of designing them among the coders of the forum, but there's something lacking somewhere for some reason.</p>

<p>No matter what I try, whether I patch something up myself, or use a ready made EQ such as yours, I feel like I'm twiddling knobs and it's just not doing what it's supposed to do, and even when it does, there's barely anything happening, no satisfaction.</p>

<p>Let me explain a set of ideal objects to you then maybe you'll see what I'm getting at.</p>

<p>Three independent objects:<br>- LP filter with cutoff, resonance, and bipolar gain.<br>- BP filter with cutoff, resonance, and bipolar gain.<br>- HP filter with cutoff, resonance, and bipolar gain.</p>

<ul>
<li>Each filter type has an inlet for cutoff, resonance, and bipolar gain.</li>
<li>No toggle on any of the filters, because a bipolar dial should be capable of positive and negative gain.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those three independent EQ objects would allow the construction of a complete EQ quite easily, no matter what the configuration.  And because each object in the set is not a complete EQ on it's own, it's possible to pick and choose which one is needed when using them in other situations where only one stage is required.</p>

<p>I feel like such a set of objects is the only way I'm ever going to get the type of EQ I want out of Axoloti, so if you're looking to add more objects to your contribution thread, please, it would be very cool to have that set of objects exactly as specified, nothing more, nothing less, no presets or any other functions whatsoever.</p>

<p>Basically, just purpose-built, independent EQ stages with inlets <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>First of all set the amount of stages you want to have (how many filters it includes)-&gt; so in your case, you set the "stages" attribute to 5.</p>

<p>The "stage" control lets you select which of these stages you're about to edit.<br>When changing stage, it automatically loads the settings of that stage.</p>

<p>STorMS-&gt;can be used when you want a mid/side spreading mode when using two modules for left&amp;right signal path, the gain-controls will be inverted for the module that has this control "on". To share settings, first setup the settings in one module, then load these settings into the other (save to a preset number and load same preset number on other module) and set the "STorMS" of one of the two modules to  "on".</p>

<p>the mode of each filter stage can be set with the "mode" control.<br>0=off/thru<br>1=peak<br>2=lowshelf<br>3=highshelf<br>so in your case the different modes for 5 stages would be:<br>2,1,1,1,3.</p>

<p>the cutoff band and gain of each stage can be set using the freq/reso/gain controls, of which the settings of the stage will be loaded when you change the "stage" control.</p>

<p>for "modders":<br>the settings are saved internally in an array.<br>as in: <br>array[stage*4]=param_mode;<br>array[stage*4+1]=param_freq;<br>array[stage*4+2]=param_reso;<br>array[stage*4+3]=param_gain;</p>

<p>This array could be updated from an external module and modulated. First add a "objref" attribute and give it a name, eg "setting". Then add a frequency inlet to your module and a "stage" parameter.<br>As code you can update this array like (eg for frequency)</p>

<p>attr_setting.array[param_stage*4+1]=inlet_freq;</p>

<p>This module then allows you to modulated the frequency.<br>Of course, also an extra control (0,1,2,3) can be added to allow you to choose which setting you want to control. Mode=0,freq=1,band=2,gain=3<br>then it would look like this:</p>

<p>attr_setting.array[param_stage*4+param_parameter]=inlet_freq;</p>

I had to remove that object you were feeding into the filter's pitch though, it was highlighted in red and refused to run unless I removed it.  Got it working though, and learnt something from it <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/sirsicksik">@SirSickSik</a><br>Hey Remco, your ParaEQ was one of the first custom objects I tried (probably the first actually).  I tried it and didn't understand the way it's set up, so intended to get back to it.  I just checked it out again, but I'm confused as to whether it's designed to be run in parallel with other instances, or used on it's own.</p>

<p>I'll figure it out, but I have to say, I don't think I've come across an EQ object yet that would work as I imagine/want it to work.  I just want to build a Parametric EQ with a total of five bands, so that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each band can be set anywhere in the 20Hz to 20kHz audio range.</li>
<li>Each band has cut and boost using a bipolar control.</li>
<li>Each band has resonance control.</li>
<li>Band 1 can be switched to low-shelf mode if required.</li>
<li>Band 5 can be switched to high-shelf mode if required.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's my ideal equalizer, and I've been trying to create it using the factory objects so that I know exactly what it's doing and how it's actually working.  I read your thread often and drool over what you do there, throuble is, because it's code and not an Axoloti patch, I can't see what's going-on inside the things <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/grin.png?v=3" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>

<p>Yes put the inverter directly on the filter. Anyway here is where I landed. Nothing special and not that good actually. ANd I never really used it, cause I didnt think it was good enough. </p>

<p>You should use an analyzer to see the effect. And actually I think there is supposed to be an allpass filter in there somewhere in the signal path. </p>

<p>But I think <a class="mention" href="/users/sirsicksik">@SirSickSik</a> has been working on an EQ. I don't know if he put it in the community library yet, but I saw a picture of it on his contributors page <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> And there is also an eq in the factory library.</p>

<p>Try a notch filter. </p>

<p>Another option is, if I remember correctly, to use a bandpass filter and then invert it. I think I used that method when I worked on an EQ long time ago.</p>

<p>When using a bandpass filter, when the signal is not inverted the bandpass filter boosts the signal at the specific frequency... And when inverted the BP filter subtracts.. A bit like Pultech style Eq, you have to select to either boost or subtract <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I did test it using various sample rates, just in case, but the spike was persistent.</p>

<p>I should stress though, it might not be due to the filter, it could just as easily be interference due to the everyday quality of the soundcard.  I've come to realise it isn't even as capable as the souncard in my older machine in some respects.  Trouble is my other machine is effectively out of service while playing around setting up Linux on it.  I'm trying to get stuff set up cause it used to have Windows XP on it, but it's a Linux box now.</p>

              <p>about the 'code comment'<br>the 0x50000000, confuses me a bit... as in the freq dials  0x07FFFFFF = 24kHz (which is max we can expect) <br>so I'm guessing it might mean 0x05000000, which is 15kHz ..<br><a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> simple typo?   are the filters only 'stable' to 15kHz, so little gain in a freq variation? </p>
