    <title>I2C hotplugging</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/i2c-hotplugging/6375</link>
    <description>Hi all,

I have 3 I2C modules (2x MPR121 and 1xOLED) connected to my core. One of them is a detachable (by RJ45 plug) mini piano (using the 2 MPR121&#39;s). I have noticed that if I have not connected the plug before booting the Axoloti Core, the piano is not working.
I was wondering whether there is a method of &#39;re-triggering&#39; or &#39;re-initializing&#39; I2C after the core has been powered on. This would allow me to disconnect the piano during a performance and connect it to a another core.
I can imagine this is an architectural limitation...
Anybody any opinions on this?
Thanks!</description>
