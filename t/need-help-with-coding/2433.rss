    <description>Hey!

I am working on a modulation distribution thingy that has got an input which goes to an amount knob to control how much is let through. this works.

Then I also have added a bipolar to unipolar switch. The switch works, but problem is the inverter takes the input, inverts it and sends it straight to the out, without going through the amount knob.

How can I make the input first go through the inverter and then through the amount knob?

Any help appreciated :)
