    <title>Axoloti rocks, too</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/axoloti-rocks-too/3552</link>
    <description>Hi all,

Linking to a couple of tracks to show that Axoloti does fun things for guitar and rock music, not just all the (lovely and inspiring and inventive) synth and sound art projects you all have shared.

Two tracks to share at the moment:

_Nothing_ (https://soundcloud.com/fe56/nothing)
this track uses a simple Axoloti multi-tapped delay patch with guitar mutes to provide a rhythm track that weaves in and out with some other percussion.  The same patch is used for the main guitar progression.  The &#39;fake granuverb&#39; patch by @cpwitz makes an appearance with some octave notes in the end.  The fuzz is all analog.    

_5e9_ (https://soundcloud.com/fe56/5e9)
this is a jumble of many ideas mashed into one song.  Has 5 Axoloti patches involved.  Another multitap delay, a spacey thing that makes weird sweeps when I hit certain notes on the fretboard, a tremolo that cross fades between two rates, the @cpwitz &#39;fake granuverb&#39; again (which I love), and a patch built around the @Sputnki bitcrusher on the bass, which degenerates into crazy static at the end.  There&#39;s also some analog fuzz in there (always). 

Nothing revolutionary as far as creative patching, and no novel objects, but worth sharing because this kind of musical application isn&#39;t showcased as much on this forum.  I&#39;m hoping to write up a few how-tos aimed at guitarists and put them on a webpage sometime soonish.  Thanks for checking this out.</description>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/u/gavin">@Gavin</a>, just try it!  that same bitcrusher sounds amazing on a bass.  Just find the sptnk/effect/bitcrusher s m object and drop it into a patch with an in an out.  It gets more exciting (but also really loud - start with low output!) at the lower bit settings.  It is a very simple concept that ends up being an amazingly responsive effect on a guitar or bass, especially if you have a loud amp and let feedback happen.  Sometimes, like in that demo song, I play the guitar entirely with my left hand... only the tiniest vibrations of the string are necessary to get a big sound, because of how the bitcrusher works, and then you get lovely glitchy stuff when the note trails off.  </p>

<p>... this is one of those effects people pay a lot for in a commercial pedal but it's instantly available with the Axoloti and it's so much fun!  Continuing in my quest to get more people playing the guitar with axoloti effects...  thanks for listening!</p>

              <p>Just posting another recent song that, I realized, uses 3 Axoloti patches for guitar effects.  The effects are the way I am filling up space with this song...it gives you a sense of how Axoloti can sound when used that way in  an indie-rock kind of setting (if totally amateur).  </p>

<p>I'm using a super-simple Axo delay on the acoustic track, the comdynamicreverb patch by  <a class="mention" href="/u/valmir">@valmir</a> for one of the melodic lines that also creates a spacey background in the middle of the song, and the <a class="mention" href="/u/sputnki">@Sputnki</a> bitcrusher is on two separate guitar tracks for all the feedbacky stuff in the background... I never get tired of a bitcrusher!</p>
