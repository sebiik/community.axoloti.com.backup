    <title>Searching tool into axp and axs files</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/searching-tool-into-axp-and-axs-files/5575</link>
    <description>I wrote for my needs a small tool to search some datas into my axp and axs files.
Maybe it could be helpful to other users, so I published it in a github repository : 
https://github.com/gregja/axosearch
There is one version in PHP and one version in Javascript (for NodeJS), which do exactly the same thing. So you must install PHP or NodeJS on your computer to use one version or the other. 
The goal is to search into the axp and axs files those which contain a string (for example : &quot;square&quot; with the option &quot;all code&quot;) or use a component (for example &quot;lfo/square&quot; with the option &quot;type attribute only&quot;). 
It helps me to find quickly some examples of patches using a component (or a sub-component).
Be careful that you must personalize the variable &quot;search_path&quot; in the beginning of the script (axosearch.js or axosearch.php) depending of your environment and the localizing of your patches in your hard disk.
