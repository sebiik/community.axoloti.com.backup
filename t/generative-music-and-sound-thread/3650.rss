    <title>Generative music and sound thread</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/generative-music-and-sound-thread/3650</link>
    <description>Hi people, I&#39;m into using rules combined with randomness to generate music generally and that is what I am using my axo for so I thought I&#39;d make a thread on here for discussion of generative music generally and also about how to do it with axo alone or by using axo as part of a bigger system.

Any users out there that are also doing generative stuff, either more tonal stuff like I&#39;m into, or just random noise, whatever floats your boat, let&#39;s exchange ideas and information.

Post your ideas, comments and example patches, or anything else related to generative music here.</description>
