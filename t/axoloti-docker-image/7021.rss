    <title>Axoloti docker image</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/axoloti-docker-image/7021</link>
    <description>Hi all,

I used to run axoloti patcher in linux, but since the last update of my debian I had problems to get the Patcher working again.

To solve the problem, my first approach has been to setup a docker container running the patcher in Ubuntu 14.04.

Now that the container is working, I am thinking on making this container image available for the community to make it very simple to install.
I am not sure that this approach is worth since the image is ~450MB but it would work on any system supporting docker containers.

So I would like to ask you your opinion about this approach and if you are interested on it.

I have also register axoloti in the docker hub, in case this approach would be useful.

Let me know your thoughts.
Cheers!</description>

<p>docker image is now available at <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/axoloti/patcher" rel="nofollow noopener">https://hub.docker.com/r/axoloti/patcher</a>.<br>Once docker.io is installed in your system, one just needs to pull the image and run the container as:<br>    docker pull axoloti/patcher:1.0.12-2<br>    docker run -it --rm --name axoloti \<br>       --net=host \<br>       -e DISPLAY \<br>       --privileged \<br>       -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb \<br>       -v ${HOME}/.Xauthority:/home/user/.Xauthority \<br>       -v ${HOME}/my-axoloti-contrib:/home/user/axoloti/axoloti-contrib \<br>       axoloti/patcher:1.0.12-2</p>

<p>To access to the USB I mount it with:<br>-v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb</p>

              <p>I have no issues with running the patcher on debian (or derived) machines and I would not be interested in a docker image based on ubuntu 14.04</p>

<p>How are you attaching to the usb device using this image?</p>
