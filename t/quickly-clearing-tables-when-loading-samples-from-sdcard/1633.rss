    <title>Quickly clearing tables when loading samples from SDcard</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/quickly-clearing-tables-when-loading-samples-from-sdcard/1633</link>
    <description>Hey guys,
I&#39;m building a drum machine patch and having lots of luck with it so far. The one issue I&#39;m having is that switching between samples I have loaded on the SDcard is somewhat glitchy. Basically, the `table/load` object only writes the table for the length of the file it&#39;s loaded in. This is in theory very nice, because it&#39;s faster than writing the entire table. But if a longer sound was previously loaded, the end of that sound will play after the current one ends, leaving phantom &quot;tails&quot; on some short sounds. :unamused:

The first solution I came up with was to just clear the whole table by loading in a long file of silence before loading any new files. That&#39;s what I&#39;m doing in this patch:

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d9ef549c09067ae21e414ff629d2260e3d58de30.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;401&quot;&gt;

It&#39;s a bit fiddly because it uses `pulselength` and `delayedpulse` to manage string values, but it does work. However, it causes a big lag and squealy noises before the new sample loads. Now I&#39;m adding selective muting to silence those squeals and so on, but I also can&#39;t scroll through sounds as quickly as I could before.

I&#39;m not sure what the best solution is, so I thought I&#39;d ask here first. I could try writing zeroes from within the patch rather than loading external silence. I could use 2 tables and round-robin between them to preload sounds. Or I could just go back and add silence to all the .raw files and make them the same length! What do you guys think makes the most sense?

Here&#39;s a quick video of the patch in action, before cleanup and subpatching things into some sensible order:

              <p>Hey guys,<br>I'm building a drum machine patch and having lots of luck with it so far. The one issue I'm having is that switching between samples I have loaded on the SDcard is somewhat glitchy. Basically, the <code>table/load</code> object only writes the table for the length of the file it's loaded in. This is in theory very nice, because it's faster than writing the entire table. But if a longer sound was previously loaded, the end of that sound will play after the current one ends, leaving phantom "tails" on some short sounds. <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/unamused.png?v=2" title=":unamused:" class="emoji" alt=":unamused:"></p>
