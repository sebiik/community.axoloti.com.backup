    <title>Error &quot;&#39;make&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command,&quot;</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/error-make-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/7077</link>
    <description>Hey :slight_smile:

One my friends borrowed an Axoloti which he wants to run on Windows. I suggested that I could post it here, as he does not have a profile atm. He says he followed technobears install instructions, but he get this error:

Generate code complete
Start compiling patch
&#39;make&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
shell task failed, exit value: 1
Compiling patch failed ( D:\axoloti patches\simple voice.axp )

Seems like it has to do with make?

What does he has to do to make this work?

Thanks on behalf of my friend Ole :)</description>

              <p>Hi Jaffa,</p>

<p>Do you know which location it was exactly? I've moved the files to the directory which the installation guide implies, but it doesn't seem to work. The runtime is not being recognized.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
