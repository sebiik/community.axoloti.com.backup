    <title>System 100 (human league being boiled percussion)</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/system-100-human-league-being-boiled-percussion/4742</link>
    <description>not sure if this is the right section, please correct me if I&#39;m wrong.
I&#39;m trying to recreate the system 100 percussion patch from The Human Leagues Being Boiled song, I&#39;ve sort of created the patch, but I cant seem to recreate the actual rhythm, because what should be the &#39;snare&#39; type part, seems to end up triggering first, even though I know the &#39;bass drum&#39; part should be first, what the heck am I doing wrong? should I be using some sort of &#39;sync&#39; module to keep them where they should be?
also, would be helpful if I could have some sort of midi keyboard trigger to set it off, instead of switching on the software and bang it starts ;) wouldnt be good live.
cheers in advance
Sean
p.s. not sure how i can include the patch so you see what I mean.</description>

              <p>Are you using the counter object for the sequencer? <br>Consider that when triggered the counter object advances of 1 step, and the "default" state is 0. <br>The correct way to patch a sequencer takes this into account, and when you press play (and only in that occurrence) you should reset the counter (via the reset inlet) instead of triggering it.</p>

<p>Clear enough?</p>
