    <title>Help with custom Send/Recieve code</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/help-with-custom-send-recieve-code/3956</link>
    <description>This is very similar to https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/fixed-coded-object-referencing-instead-of-using-an-attribute/3825/6

But that thread seems to have wrapped up and it did not have a syntax example which would be super helpful.

In the factory &#39;recv f&#39; I find this code in the k-rate tab, &#39;outlet_v = attr_sender._vi;&#39;.   The &#39;attr_sender&#39; is an object reference which is the &#39;name&#39; of the send object.

It seems like all I have to do is change &#39;attr_sender._vi&#39; to &#39;object-name&#39;._vi.  If I want more send/receives I just add variables in the send/receive objects that take the place of &#39;_vi&#39;.

Here is some pseudo code of what I want to accomplish:

In send object, named &#39;midiCentral&#39;
int32_t send  = 1&lt;&lt;27;

In receive object;
int32_t receive = parent-&gt;instancemidiCentral_i.send;

Is that all there is to it?</description>

              <p>Thanks! That is helpful.</p>

<p>In my case, the patch is designed to be used with one specific midi controller ( a BCR 2000 ) which needs to be mapped to specific CC channels for my control scheme to conform to the BCR's design/capabilities. So if my code ever goes into the community (it is a possibility, I have put a lot of work into my project), they would need to use it with a BCR 2000 or modify the code significantly even if I don't hard code object references.</p>

<p>I am creating a 8 voice (with 6 controls each, and ability to route/weigh 4 cv inputs to each control) drum machine that takes 8 trigger inputs and 4 cv inputs from Eurorack modules.  It also sends 24ppq midi clock as CV pulses to Eurorack.  I'm using it with a Trigger Riot module and a DSI Pro-2. It is actually mostly done and the breadboard prototype is fully functional.  I have hard-coded bass, snare, and cymbal voices to save sram and allow 8 voices to run/be-controlled (hard-coding the voice 'patches' allowed me to have 8 voices instead of about 2 if they were in sub-patches) . I am going to design other hard coded voices to plug-in like a 'synth-voice' and a simple sampler.  I just need to build the proto-board, slap it in a box, and polish/expand the code.</p>

<p>I will fully spill the beans about the project once it is a bit further along.  At that time I will consider if the code part and hardware io design is worth sharing. There are probably a few pieces of code/ objects people will find useful like the hard-coded drum voices perhaps, which would not be too hard to modify to create normal patch-able control inputs.</p>
