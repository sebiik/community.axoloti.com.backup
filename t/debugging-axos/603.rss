    <title>Debugging axo&#39;s</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/debugging-axos/603</link>
    <description>Hi guys,

I&#39;m working in an object and and it&#39;s crashing after I added a pretty innocent line of code. 

    	void setDecayTime(float f)
	{
		static const float minTime = 1.0f;
		static const float maxTime = 2.0f;
		static const float range = maxTime-minTime;
		decayTime = (f*range + minTime) * samplerate;
	}
If i remove that last line, everything is fine, but otherwise, it compiles but when it runs it does nothing (no sound, dsp load  is 0%)
How do you debug such a problem?  Running it in a debugger would be great of course, but maybe its possible to print to the console somehow? 
The code runs fine on osx. 

thanks.</description>

              <p>Ive have seen major issues with optimisation ... it gets quite common when you start building more complex objects.</p>

<p>for me the issue was (and there are quite a lot of variations) is -O3 is very aggressive at inline coding,  this is partly down to the way axoloti creates everything into one file (xpatch.cpp) and so it appears to the compiler as being a likely candidate for inlining. this inlining obviously increases the memory footprint of the code <strong>significantly</strong> - when you use -O2 it reduces the likelihood of inlining.<br>however if you look at the GCC manual you will find there are preprocessor directives you can give to functions to explicitly tell the compiler to not inline.</p>

<p>(cpu performance obviously drops when you don't inline as its an extra function call, hence the art of performance tuning, deciding where you want to take the hit)</p>

<p>probably in the mid-term axoloti should allow for multiple source file includes, and also for compiler options to be specified.</p>

              <p>Hi Johannes,</p>

<p>I'm porting  a guitar multi FX o wrote of osx to axoloti. The code is bit too much to post here. The method above just sets some feedback level for the reverb and is called at krate.<br>The thing is, occasionally I get the 0% cpu after i have made some very minor change in code, which could not possibly cause any problems by itself.<br>I added some logging at initialization which is working normally, but when I get the "0%" none of the logging is printed to the console either, so maybe the patch isn't started somehow. But there are no compile errors and the console says:</p>

<pre><code>Done compiling patch
Start uploading patch
bin path: /Volumes/Intern/Users/fokke/Documents/axoloti/build/xpatch.bin
block uploaded @ 0x20011000 length 12980
Done uploading patch
Start starting patch
Done starting patch
Start locking
Done locking</code></pre>

<p>which makes me think everything is fine. Maybe the patch the patch is too big ? (perhaps unlikely at 12980 bytes). Could it be some kind of exception is happening?<br>Is there a way to turn on some more verbose logging?  </p>

<p>I mentioned in that setting set using -O2 rather than -O2 seems to solve the problem. But know i've changed that to<br>-O2 -finline-functions -funswitch-loops -fpredictive-commoning -fgcse-after-reload -ftree-loop-vectorize -ftree-loop-distribute-patterns -ftree-slp-vectorize -fvect-cost-model -ftree-partial-pre  -fipa-cp-clone</p>

<p>(which according to the gcc manual should do the same thing as -O3) And the patch runs fine (although is now only 9612 bytes) .....so i am a bit confused here.</p>

<p>Of course editing the Makefile is not really a permanent solution, and I don't think it actually fixes the real problem.</p>

<p>you can insert logging, which gets sent to the Axoloti console:</p>

<p>just use it in the same was as printf,  just be careful not to send too much logging. (board will disconnect if you do)</p>
