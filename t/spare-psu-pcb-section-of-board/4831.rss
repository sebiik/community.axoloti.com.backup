    <title>Spare psu pcb section of board?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/spare-psu-pcb-section-of-board/4831</link>
    <description>Hi Guys,

So...
I&#39;ve designed a small box for my Axoloti, but to fit the board, I had to cut the MIDI IO / PSU part of the board and placed into a box for later usage.
Now, I moved the board into a 1U rack I&#39;d like to use the external PSU option.
As I you can guess, I can&#39;t find the board.
So my question is that do you think, is it possible to buy only that part of the board, or, do any of you have 1 left?</description>

              <p>the pc board is made in one piece, <br>but PM <a class="mention" href="/u/johannes">@johannes</a>, you never know might have a board that the other half died, so can give you a deal on the midi part - a bit of a long shot, but perhaps worth a try <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
