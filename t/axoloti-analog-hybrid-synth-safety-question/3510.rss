    <title>Axoloti - Analog Hybrid synth: safety question</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/axoloti-analog-hybrid-synth-safety-question/3510</link>
    <description>My coworker has bought the axoloti and we plan on making some kind of hardware synth with it. We figured it would be cool to do a digital analog hybrid, so I&#39;ll be making a VCF and probably an analog EG so that we only need a trig out from the axoloti. 

My question is, should I be setting up some voltage buffers so I don&#39;t accidentally blast like 15 volts DC into the audio jack? I&#39;m pretty new to synth DIY so I want to be as cautious as possible. 

Thanks</description>
