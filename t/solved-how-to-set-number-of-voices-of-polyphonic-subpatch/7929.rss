    <title>[solved] How to set number of voices of polyphonic subpatch?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/solved-how-to-set-number-of-voices-of-polyphonic-subpatch/7929</link>
    <description>I see online various references to setting the number of voices for a subpatch, however I can&#39;t find any setting like that. Does it exist, and if so, where?

Edit: never mind, I forgot to set the subpatch to poly in its settings.</description>
