    <title>Sequencer example with step edit, user input by keyboard, save on card etc</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/sequencer-example-with-step-edit-user-input-by-keyboard-save-on-card-etc/826</link>
    <description>Hi,
Just a patch example of a sequencer i made for my project. 
Its quite simple : 
&lt;a class=&quot;attachment&quot; href=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/a/abc8d6d97fefce8b134fd760536dc6cec4b17fa9.axp&quot;&gt;stepSequencerV1b.axp&lt;/a&gt; (40.7 KB)
-In **record mode** you can input notes with your keyboard in step by step mode, you can also insert REST (old school step by step sequencer).

-You can edit steps and insert a note anywhere defined by the step selector. Selecting a step with the radio control play the selected step as well. 

-You can transpose sequence and change the number of step.
-you can save preset and load preset on SD card (you have to select a preset number)
-The sequencer is not triggered by a clock but by user input using a midi key for example. This is because i am using a version of this patch with my drummer who do not want to play with a click :) So you have to send a gate signal.

              <p>Hi.<br>It was my first attempt at creating a sequencer and unfortunately, since im a dad, didnt have time to play more with the Axoloti <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>The transpose function is quite simple. It take the note value from the table and add the input note value so the output is always the actual note value from input keyboard + note value from table .<br>I did another version because REST value cause problem (the implementation is wrong in the actual patch).<br>I will take a look this weekend.</p>

              <p>Hi everybody</p>

<p>I am using the stepSequencer from sovietpop, mainly patch seq a. Sovietpop you've done great work! Thanks.<br>I implemented, that when there is a rest no gate is triggered.</p>

<p>I have a problem with the transpose function. Its not as easy as it looks. The transpose function is not really working. So I tried to solve it. But I gave up.</p>

<p>Can somebody explain me, how a real transpose function can be implemented?</p>
