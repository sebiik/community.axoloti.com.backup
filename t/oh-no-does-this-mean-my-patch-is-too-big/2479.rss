    <title>Oh no! Does this mean my patch is too big?</title>

    <description>I just added two of my sub patches to a patch I&#39;ve been working on, and I get this compilation error message:

I assume this means my patch is too big :frowning:. If so, are there any common suggestions about how to get rid of excess bloat in a patch? Is there a way to tell what parts are using the most memory space?
Thanks!

              <p>Ok, I think the patch is "done". I have learned a lot about optimizing resources! 2 things I would share are "never use a blue when a green will do," and "avoid running wires backward - especially reds." I think those two things saved me the most SRAM (besides the other things mentioned in theTechnoBear's great post.)<br>I have a 4 track looper (rbrt's) that I modified to sync to a master clock. It can have secondary loops the same length as the first loop, or shorter (but still quantized to the clock.) The master clock also drives rhythms on my Music Easel, so everything syncs up. I also have two effects, a delay/panner, and another panner driven by the Easel's sequencer voltages. The whole thing is controlled by a Launch Control XL with some button color feedback.<br>I'm going to post more about my setup in the "Your Projects" forum.<br>Thanks to everyone for your help!<br>Karl</p>

<p>one small tip on this... if your up to creating custom objects.</p>

<p>if you take this part of the patch, and place it into an embedded sub-patch, you can then convert this into an object.<br>the code produced is not 'pretty', but sometimes is a good starting place for refactoring and generally rewriting with  the optimisation required.</p>

<p>important note: just converting to an object will <strong>not</strong> bring any gains, the gains come from the C coding you then do to optimise the generated code.  I dont want to start a rumour that subpatches should be converted to objects for improvements - it wont, and makes your patch much harder to edit later <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> <br>(general coding tip: optimisations like this are always best done once the patch is 'stable' and unlikely to change) </p>

<p>a second, advanced tip, related to custom objects and code bloat, which in some case can bring a big reduction in code size.</p>

<p>axoloti inlines as much as possible, since it is after speed optimisation over 'space optimisation'. this is normally what you want for DSP, as its time critical.  BUT if you have non time critical code, you can avoid this optimisation in 2 steps<br>a) put your function in header file<br>b) where you declare your function add '<strong>attribute</strong>((noinline)) ' to the end</p>

<p>I consider this an 'advanced tip', so not going to say more, except you can see i do this on my Push object, so use that as an example. <br>just remember this is for non time critical code, e.g. initialisation, midi handlers, or other things outside the audio thread... if you dont respect this, you might get audio dropouts <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Well, I've learned there are no easy answers! I took all the presets and mod sources down to 0 (after figuring out what that actually meant), halved the size of my loop table, and simplified some logic. My patch is based on rbrt's 4 slot loop station. The biggest culprit was the code to do button color feedback on my Launch Control. Each button required several flip flops, toggles, pulse delays, etc. depending on what I wanted it to do. I've decided to eliminate all that. It was very pretty and cool once I got it to work, but if the patch can't do what I want, well what's the point. So, with that out of the way, and having learned some lessons about simplifying, I think I can get it all happening. I'll post something once it is working.<br>Thanks!<br>Karl</p>

<p>I've had patches go over from adding one or two specific things, but will take many, many more objects. It all depends on how the patches compile and how the objects couple together.</p>

<p>It may be frustrating, but starting with one patch and then adding / removing things one at a time to figure out what is setting the patch over the edge has given me really complex patches.

The axoloti board is a powerful board, but like everything it has only a finite amount of memory and processing power. The good news is axoloti is also very flexible, so there are lots of ways to get to similar results! 

Here are some tips about how to best make use of the resources it has. 

Memory

SRAM is very precious on the Axoloti (used by table/write delay/write) , there is much more SDRAM available,

<p>if you PM me your patch, I can take a look - see if there is anything obvious.</p>

<p>one thing thats notable is you are running out of both sram and sdram , the later is most likely tables/delays etc...  so might be you need to think about reducing these.</p>

<p>of course, if your combining FX and synth generation, you could get another axoloti board, and chain them <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I assume this means my patch is too big <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/frowning.png?v=3" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:">. If so, are there any common suggestions about how to get rid of excess bloat in a patch? Is there a way to tell what parts are using the most memory space?<br>Thanks!<br>Karl</p>
