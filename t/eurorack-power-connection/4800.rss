    <title>Eurorack power connection</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/eurorack-power-connection/4800</link>
    <description>I am interested in mounting the Axo to my EuroRack. I don’t see any posts on howto ribbon cable to the board. Anyone have details that will help? I have the Doepfer specs and I think i have the BOM for the jumper but I wouldn’t mind someone with experience giving some advice


Also, a panel design for say a 4-6hp would be a bonus


Thanks in advance

              <p>The board can be stacked or even in the same plane as long as the connections in the break away section are still wired together. They have doubled the holes there for that reason, to be use with headers or ribbon connectors. For the ultimate small HP, at the sacrifice of depth, you could put both boards on the same plane with the midi board behind the main one. </p>

<p>The next size is the main board horizontal making a ~23HP panel, with the MIDI board stacked above or below it. That would leave a lot of room for controls and jacks too.</p>

              <p>I wonder if rather than going wide I can still break out the midi portion, stand it off from the board going vertical, still side by side. I could then get a few cvs and pots in there. But the connection points are densly packed.</p>

<p>Did not know the power down regulator was on the breakout portion. </p>

<p>Time to fiddle.</p>

              <p>It is easier to just commit to a wide module that is as wide as the full Axo board and has MIDI in and OUT. The space under the PCB on the panel can easily fit 16 pots for full control and even fit the jacks for the digital I/O for clocks out and in (you will have to make level matching circuitry there). I have a panel designed for that arrangement and will have a Doepfer A-192-1 sitting right next to it to do the 16 CV inputs (along with the 16-pots) via MIDI CC control.</p>

              <p>First you won't be able to fit a Axo board into 4-6HP unless you break off the MIDI section and even that will be a tight fit with some euro rails (mainly Z-rails), As far as the power goes though, that is simple, the Axo takes between 7-15V so the +12V of the Eurorack will be no problem. Just take the +12V line and the GRN line and either wire up a compatible plug to go into the power input jack which is in the MIDI section you can't remove if you want a 4-6HP panel or with to the power jacks pads. Since the power regulator is also on the MIDI section (it is U1), if you remove that, you will have to give the board a regulated +5V which you could connect to the pins on the USB connector (and not use that connector) or use the JP2 and JP3 connector left over when breaking off the MIDI board, Pin 1 carries the +5V from the regulator and pin 5 carries the ground. You can look on the schematic - <a href="http://www.axoloti.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/axoloti-core-sch-v10.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.axoloti.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/axoloti-core-sch-v10.pdf</a> and see if there is a place you can connect to.</p>
