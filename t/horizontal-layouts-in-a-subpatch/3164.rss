    <title>Horizontal Layouts in a subpatch</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/horizontal-layouts-in-a-subpatch/3164</link>
    <description>Hey, I looks from the forum that this is currently not possible but i just want to confirm. i&#39;d like to make a sub patch of the following (screenshot) so i can add it into other patches. Its based on the Intellejel Metropolis Sequencer and each of the vertical radio buttons performs the ratcheting. I would love to be able to get the vertical radios into the subpatcher similar to how i have them laid out in the below patch. If i try to put them in a subpatch they all show up stacked on top of each other and completely visually unusable as a sequencer. 

Below is the layout i want but would like it visible from patch/patcher.
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e4e5508a2cf499bf37accb983802647b56e83ba9.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;346&quot;&gt;

Also the sel/sel faders can only be added one at a time and also display stacked instead of horizontal. 

Is there anyway to tweak this by hand in the XML of the patch/patcher to move the UI elements around.</description>

              <p>for me, the patcher is more designed for creation than using 'live'.</p>

<p>ideally, for me,  there would be 'presentation' view, where you could layout controls, like you can in both Max/Reaktor.</p>

<p>however,  increasingly, I don't think this is the way forward, I actually the presentation/control  interface should be separate from the patcher.</p>

<p>today, you can use something like Lemur, Max, PD (or numerous other tools) and build a custom interface that can interface with Axoloti via MIDI.</p>

<p>the advantage, is the UI could be anything, and could run on any platform (Mac, raspberry PI, iPad, iPhone), its not limited to the small range of controls provided in the patcher UI.</p>

<p>but, i accept, there are currently a few limitations:<br>- midi is limited (eg 127 cc) and not particularly efficient.<br>- its 'fiddly', you have to assign midi cc to anything you want to control, and then remember that mapping, this make interface design laborious. </p>

<p>so hopefully, when the parameters are exposed a little better from the axo board, we will be able to do something a little different... that will retain the advantage of this approach, but mitigate some of the inconveniences.</p>

<p>I will say though, this is very much my personal opinion, and its rather biased - I think of an Axoloti patch as a 'standalone' instrument/fx ... others I'm sure have very different opinions and also use Axoloti in a very different manner.</p>

              <p>I too would like to see a cleaner, more customize-able way of laying out patches.</p>

<p>The way I see it is that the Axoloti really shines as a hardware device - you should potentially be working towards your patches being controlled from a setup of knobs and buttons.  </p>

<p>I know everything is still being worked on and I have hope that it will only get better.</p>

<p>Good things will come in time <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
