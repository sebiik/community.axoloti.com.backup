    <description>Hey :) 

Finally got Axoloti working. Nice tool :smile:

But I think I encountered a bug in the stomp/reverb1 object. When you turn the reverb object on, it seems like the feed of the reverb tilts to the right side. As soon as you turn it off the stereo field slowly goes back to normal. At higher decay the sound first tilts to the right side and the sound gradually fades out.. I feed the same signal to both sides so there shouldnt be any difference.

You can recreate it the simply by adding the reverb to a signal chain and turn it on. Or check the attached patches.

I build a synth and added the reverb and noticed the bug. Then I tried loading up the guitar multi fx patch and I added an osc, an ADSR, a vca, connect them and feed them into the reverb, to check if it was my first patch that was the issue. And as soon as i turned the reverb on, same thing happened again. The feed tilts to the right side. 

I am on Mac, OSX 10.9.5, No HUB, Usb cable directly to computer
Axoloti version 1.0.3-0-gc248736

              <p>Ahh ok <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile"> Learning everyday. </p>

<p>But still there is something, atleast on my system that, that makes the reverb do something weird, especially when the phasor osc is send into the reverb . Check the video I posted. It shows a phasor oscillator and the cheap saw feed into the reverb with a low pass filter. There is huge difference between the output of the reverb, depending on which oscillator is feed into the reverb. Sputnki it might thave something to do with the phasor osc being feed into the delay anyway <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt="wink">. Maybe some phase canceling going on in the feedback network? It is almost the reverb first feeds alot and then phase cancels and totally dissapears..... until i turn down the phasor osc. Watch the RME mixer inputs on the right how the input reacts, when I change from cheap saw to phasor osc. </p>

<p>I have also been trying to build my own reverb in Nord G2 cause the one that is there could be better. But for this I am not really using math and algorithms, just my ears. </p>

<p>Yeah I also got a couple of them, so I could use one for effects and one for synth <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile"> </p>

<p>Video(maybe not the best, but can you see what is going on):<br><a href="https://vid.me/BT5J" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://vid.me/BT5J</a></p>

<p>For now, I will just use another osc than the phase oscillator.</p>

<blockquote><p>There is no stereo signal chain in the feedback path</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>I think thats part of the 'design'... you will see that although the delay lines are mono, the fdn output is not, i.e. it is creating a stereo field which is mixed in with the original stereo....  </p>

<p>and of course thats part of the fun on reverbs, how you mess with the stereo field and delays to introduce space, you can do also sorts of funky things messing with this, and create your own effects.<br>I nearly started on topic on this, because this is one area Id love to see the community get stuck into, Id quite happily dedicate one board, to just having a stack of reverb algos on an SDcard. (johannes granular verb is my favourite at the moment) </p>

<p>one small question I had for <a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@Johannes</a> is, how much headroom is there over +/- 1 in an audio signal? as this patch adds 2 signals together (so could go to +2/-2) and the does a div 2... is there 1 extra bit to cope with this, or will it overflow/saturate?  if so the div2 should come first, but that would reduce precision by 1bit...<br>so whats the range of a audio signal is 1 already 32bit (signed)  or only 31 bit?</p>

              <p>And I think it is very good that you involve us. To me the goal is to be able to patch/program everything on my own and to learn that, only way is to get my hands dirty <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile"> And listen closely to people in this community <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile"> </p>

<p>I did open up the subpatch and I think I can see some issues. <br>First one: The left and right stereo inputs of the sub patch are feed into the same mono mixer to create the feedback network. There is no stereo signal chain in the feedback path and that might has something to do why they sound different on the outputs. I will check signal paths later. and also try and compile a new reverb, with full stereo signal path. But Now I promised the kids to go outside. In Denmark a non rainy day is a good day <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile"></p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/jaffasplaffa">@jaffasplaffa</a>, the stomps can be edited, by using 'edit object definition' as they are sub patches, you are free to go in there, and see if you can find the cause, or at least narrow it down.<br>(Id always encourage community involvement, in some of this leg work... many hands make light work etc)</p>
