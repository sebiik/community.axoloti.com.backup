    <title>Scope for slow signals</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/scope-for-slow-signals/961</link>
    <description>While playing with a complicated patch I often found myself wishing for more advanced debug tools.  I&#39;m excessively using scope and hex objects, but sometimes I really want to capture signals that are longer than 128 samples.

I found it very hard to observe the multiple control signals in my patch as their periods all are longer than 128 samples.  It would be very helpful if there was a more advanced scope, which received values over USB and displayed them locally.

How are you dealing with complicated control signals while developing?</description>

              <p>Maybe you could arrange multiple scopes in a row and route the same signal to all of them, but with varying amounts (multiples of 128 samples) of delay? Not the most elegant solution but I think it would work.</p>

              <p>Maybe I'm doing things wrong, but "disp/chart p" is very small and that makes it hard to see the shape of the signals.  They are just about too wide to be seen clearly in kscope and just too short to be seen clearly in the chart.</p>
