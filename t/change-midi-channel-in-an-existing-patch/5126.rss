    <title>Change midi channel in an existing patch?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/change-midi-channel-in-an-existing-patch/5126</link>
    <description>Hi guys,

I&#39;m very new here so pardon me if this has been asked.

I wonder if it&#39;s possible to change midi channel in the Axoloti on a patch I already have in it? 

The problem is that I can&#39;t find the patch and I would love to keep it as it&#39;s but only change midi channel.

Or even better is it possible to get the patch from the Axoloti somehow if it&#39;s already in the flash memory of it?

Thanks!</description>

              <p>Thanks very much! And thanks for explaining how the patch within the flash memory.</p>

<p>I thought for example that it might be possible to just upload a patch from the internal flash memory back onto the computer somehow.</p>

<p>I managed to find the patch anyway and placed a lot more CCs to it and the right channel so it's cool but thanks once again for letting me know how it works!</p>

<p>THANKS!</p>

              <p>sorry, that is a no for both.</p>

<p>you have to understand that the patch, once loaded onto the axoloti is actually a program that is compiled. so you would need a decompiler to get a patch again, not a trivial task...</p>

<p>or you look at the generated binary and you try to find the midi channel in there, good luck with that <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>hmm, best to find that patch again somehow. other "solution" i can think of is to get a second axoloti and patch up a midi channel offset. you can then feed the midi out of your offset axoloti into your patch... (or buy some other gear where you can change the incoming midi channel to something else)</p>
