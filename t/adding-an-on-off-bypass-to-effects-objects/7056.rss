    <title>Adding an on/off (bypass) to effects objects?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/adding-an-on-off-bypass-to-effects-objects/7056</link>
    <description>I want to code a bypass switch in effects objects, to control the effect using only one S-rate cable instead of two into a multiplexer with a toggle switch. I&#39;m not sure if this is how the DSP works, but with my current method of making a webwork of multiplexers, it seems as though the actual audio output of the axoloti is being affected in larger patches. Sound is clipping at weird settings, even at very low volumes, like in the elements reverb when the diffusion knob is turned too far away from the amount knob(?). In less complex patches it works fine.

Also not sure if this is a result of having a bunch of S-rate cables going out of the same source, but the overall volume of the patch seems to be reduced with the more cables coming from an audio outlet. As always, execution order is taken into account.

Is there a quick and efficient method of coding a bypass switch into objects to achieve what I&#39;m trying to do?</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>For making internal switch in any object to turn an effect on/off, you could try something like this:<br>/////////////// START</p>

<p>if(param_On){</p>

<p>Insert your effect code here !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>}<br>else{<br>outlet_AudioOut = inlet_AudioIn;<br>}</p>

<p>/////////////////////////// END</p>

<p>So if you turn that On parameter on, it will process the code with in the first {} brackets, which should be your effects code. If On parameter is off, you process the code with in the else statements {} brackets, which in this case sends the input directly to the output.</p>

<p>If you want to have an inlet, instead of the On parameter, you can replace "param_On" with a yellow inlet, called "inlet_on". For example..... <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
