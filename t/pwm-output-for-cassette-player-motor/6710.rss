    <title>PWM output for cassette player motor</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/pwm-output-for-cassette-player-motor/6710</link>
    <description>Hi folks!
I recently found a working cassette player/walkmen and thought it would be fun to knock up a mellotron style hack for my axoloti! I have only a little electronics knowledge but seems like it might be possible to directly run the motor from a PWM output on the Axoloti to control the motor speed for pitch. These old, kind of crappy devices arent cheap these days and I&#39;m a little worried about screwing it up. Are there any issues I should consider before testing this out and accidently frying something? Particulars:

DC to cassette player is 3v
I am proposing to wire a switched jack to the tape motor that would recieve PWM directly from the axoloti

Other older posts seem to indicate the existing frequency of the PWM might be quite high for a DC motor? 94hz or something?

Would v much appreciate some input if anyone has time. I will definitely post photos and updates for future users wanting to give this a shot!</description>

<p>But sounds like its better to use separate power in the long run to avoid damaging the axoloti. I'll look at external power for the final build, thanks!</p>

<p>When I find two more cassette players ill do the same mod (I plan to make a 3 voice paraphonic hybrid synth with this set up) perhaps I'll need external power then?</p>

<p>For other electronics newbs like me who want to understand how to do this: <br>- Take power from somewhere (I just took it from the VDD on the Axoloti board) and connect it the collector pin of the transistor<br>- PWM from the axoloti goes to the base (middle) pin<br>- connect the PWM modified output from the emitter pin to the motor<br>- the other motor wire goes to ground of the power source</p>

<p>it worked without a resister, diode or capacitor in the circuit. They are probably important so I'm going to add them back in and try to learn why before I stop bread boarding!</p>

              <p>v interesting suggestion! I had a look and the IC you described seems to be an LA4167, there is documentation for it so maybe I could figure it out. But I imagine I'd need to cut traces on the board and rewire from the IC somehow? I think that might be too advanced for me, I'm still pretty new to this stuff. Interesting to get a better understanding of how the device works tho!</p>

<p>I tried 3v/5v/9v external power and nothing. I could easily be missing something here but I'm fairly confident I breadboarded those circuits properly. Next step will be to see if I can get my head around how to use a l9110s to drive the circuit (Thx <a class="mention" href="/u/paulus">@Paulus</a>) the prebuilt modules look good but my local store doesn't stock those and I'd rather avoid shipping times, but that will be my next step if I can't get the IC to work for me on my own.</p>

              <p>Yes, you need a transistor that can let enough current through for the motor to overcome some mechanical resistance.<br>If you have no cassette in, "play" is harder work for the motor than rewind or fast forward, so it's no wonder that the latter works while "play" doesn't. The reason for this is that fast forward and rewind only move empty gears around (as long as there is no cassette inserted), while during "play" a rubber roller is pressed against the capstan, so there is more friction there which can easily stop an under-powered motor (it probably gets only one tenth of its nominal current from the Axoloti).<br>Another point: a cassette player usually has some control circuit to stabilize the motor speed against changes in mechanical load, supply voltage and temperature. It used to be two transistors that added some more voltage when the motor drew more current, but your device probably has a dedicated IC for that. And perhaps even a sensor for the actual speed. You might want to use that circuit (and only change its setpoint to change the motor speed), unless you are really into <em>that</em> aspect of the Mellotron.</p>

<p>Testing the idea of using the PWM directly hasn't worked. The motor turns at a very low speed, by using a ctrl dial in the patch I can slow the speed down slightly (60/64) before the motor and playback stop entirely. The fast forward/rewind buttons work fine weirdly and must use a dedicated 2nd motor somewhere else.</p>

<p>If I can find an electronics store thats open tomorrow I will try using a transistor as suggested in this post <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/how-to-drive-a-dc-motor/3013/7">http://community.axoloti.com/t/how-to-drive-a-dc-motor/3013/7</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/gavin">@Gavin</a> seems to have posted a circuit diagram thats gone missing. Searching for "2n222 dc motor" produced a variety of circuits for arduinos that look pretty simple. Will give it a shot.</p>

              <p>Hi folks!<br>I recently found a working cassette player/walkmen and thought it would be fun to knock up a mellotron style hack for my axoloti! I have only a little electronics knowledge but seems like it might be possible to directly run the motor from a PWM output on the Axoloti to control the motor speed for pitch. These old, kind of crappy devices arent cheap these days and I'm a little worried about screwing it up. Are there any issues I should consider before testing this out and accidently frying something? Particulars:</p>

<p>DC to cassette player is 3v<br>I am proposing to wire a switched jack to the tape motor that would recieve PWM directly from the axoloti</p>

<p>Other older posts seem to indicate the existing frequency of the PWM might be quite high for a DC motor? 94hz or something?</p>

<p>Would v much appreciate some input if anyone has time. I will definitely post photos and updates for future users wanting to give this a shot!</p>
