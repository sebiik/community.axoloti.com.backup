              <p>If you really want to connect a passive speaker to Axoloti Core, the headphone output is the best suited for this, I'd suggest a single 16ohm speaker connected between the tip/ring (left-right), leave the sleeve of the mini-jack unconnected, and configure "audio/outconfig" to 0dB/Balanced. That effectively forms a "bridge-tied load" configuration.<br>For tiny portable setups, there are many different nice usb-charged-battery-powered speakers on the market for use with smartphones and tablets, that can connect to the line output. </p>

<p>The design motivation for not including a power amplifier is that different applications need different power levels, there is no one-fits-all solution. Any substantial amount of power would also put more demands on the power supply. Some very early prototypes integrated a tiny poweramp, but I recall in some situations, generating a loud sub-bass caused a system reset by overloading the power supply...</p>

              <p>Depends on the kind of speakers: </p>

<p>Active ones with a line in, sure! Just remember to connect to the line out and not the headphone socket.</p>

<p>Passive ones, depends. The Axoloti doesn't have a power amp, so it's not going to be able to drive speakers itself unless they are the kind of crappy passive speakers that are intended to be driven by a headphone output. While I've not tried them on the axoloti they should work in theory. Just don't expect it to sound good.</p>

<p>Did you have particular speakers in mind? If you can show me an example I might be able to help.</p>
