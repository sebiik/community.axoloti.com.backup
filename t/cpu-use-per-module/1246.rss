    <title>CPU use per module</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/cpu-use-per-module/1246</link>
    <description>Hi there, would it be somehow possible to somehow show the ram&amp;CPU use of single modules in the patcher?
This would be very useful for being able to compare certain routings or the use of certain modules or in case that you&#39;re building against the limits of the axoloti and you need to see where you&#39;re able to cut on cpu/ram usage.</description>

              <p>cpu - this is already possible , using timer/timeri<br>(clue... think carefully about execution order <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> )</p>

<p>RAM is difficult, as its allocated statically... i.e. its done by the compiler, so we would need to get this info from the compiled image (elf I suspect) , so probably something we could report when the compile is done. oh and it would be segments, as memory is not contiguous) <br>.. you could currently do this manually if you know the elf command line tools</p>

<p>runtime ram usage, doesn't really have a lot of meaning on axoloti, its generally avoided... unless you include the stack but that i think would be very difficult to measure.  (but should really be minimal, hopefully)</p>

<p>of course, perhaps in the future some of this could be 'integrated' like a debugger, which could also help with bugs in execution order.</p>
