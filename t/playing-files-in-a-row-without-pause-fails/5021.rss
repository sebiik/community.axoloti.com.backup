    <title>Playing files in a row without pause fails</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/playing-files-in-a-row-without-pause-fails/5021</link>
    <description>Hi there to solve my issue of uploading files &gt; 8Mb I divided my files in chunks. Now I&#39;d like to play them without interruption if possible. So I use a bunch of &quot;wave / play stereo fn&quot; daisychained together.
I thought I could coonnect the END output to trigger the START inlet of the next object but it doens&#39;t work. For some reason they all trigger at startup. I thought maybe I should use a comparator to check for 1 value so I used math == without succes. Any help? Is there a way to debug? Visualize the values in the patches? Thanks
