    <title>Output note off when none is received</title>

    <description>Hello all!

So I have been working for some time on a midi multi effect with the Axoloti. It all started off a bit as a way to learn the logic of the patcher by trying tio replicate the midi delay implemented in the Yamaha TX81Z. SInce then i added lots of another features, like random CC and PC sends as well as basic but useful stuff like an octave changer.

The patch I am working on is mainly designed so I can use basic notes sent by my LXR drum machine and transform them for improvisation live act.

It&#39;s getting there but I a bit stuck with a feature of the LXR that has been pretty annoying since quite some time: 
The sequencer does not send note off data.
The only way to have a note stop is to add another note with 0 velocity on the sequencer just after the said note.

So now, because of this behavior, my midi delay does not work at all since I am sending notes to a monophonic synth (Shruthi). The first note sent stays on as long as the sequencer plays and only resets after it stops.

Would there be a way, with Axoloti, to add a note off right after each note received?

Not sure if I should focus on the in/keyb or or on the out/note…
There is a releaseVelocity in the midi/in/keyb but none on the midi/out/note…

thanks!</description>

              <p>Ok erm, this is embarassing, I may have found the answer myself. It's maybe not the best way to do it but for the sake of sharing it if would be of any use:</p>

<p>I added a flipflop set by the gate of the midi/in/keyb and reset by a timer/delayedpulse. I can then feed the signal to the note/out.</p>

<p>Its very specific of what I wanted to achieve because this way, every incoming note will output the Axoloti withy the same length. I might add a external pot to control the length of the note later.</p>

<p>I guess the best way to do that would be to modify the code of the LXR, but that is way beyond my reach.</p>

<p>Pretty happy that the Axoloti is there also to compensate or add some feature to other devices.</p>
