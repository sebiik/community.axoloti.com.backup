    <description>Hello everyone 
I received my axoloty unit as accomplishment of a short course I did.
The unit was `working perfectly during the two weeks of studying, but as soon as I brong that home i never managed to make it work again somehow.
Since it doesn&#39;t connect with the computer i originally worked on either i have to think that there something wrong with the interface itself, maybe due to some safeguard errors carrying it away without a case.

Below I left the message i receive from the software in response at my attempts to connect it.
I hope some of you would be able to suggest me what to do with it,
Cheers!

Then select in the Board menu -&gt; Firmware -&gt; Flash (Rescue)... If the LEDs stay off, but you still get "No devices in DFU mode detected.", then â€¦</p></blockquote></aside></p>

              <p>Hi everyone,<br>Just wondering if you tried reinstalling the software on your computer?<br>I had a similar problem, everything worked one day and then the next it just stopped working, no changes were made as far as I could tell (from one day to the next). Initially I feared it may have been a hardware issue; however, I nuked all the axoloti software on my computer (Mac/OSX at the time) and reinstalled everything and I was back in business. If you are using a Linux-based system make sure you set properly the user permissions and udev rules for usb connectivity.<br>(If you don't know how to do this let me know and I'll walk you through it)<br>Additionally, if you have not already tested this, try connecting the axoloti core with a different USB cable, preferably a high quality data capable cable. If you've already tried this try again with another cable. My axoloti has been finicky with cables that otherwise function with some of my other dev boards.<br>If LEDs are coming online when the board is powered up odds are the hardware is functioning properly and there is a miscommunication between the board and your computer. In my experience it would be pretty difficult to damage the axoloti hardware unless you were doing something reckless (ie. injecting voltages where you shouldn't, or going well outside of voltage tolerances). That having been said there is the outside chance that your board suffered static shock damage. This could occur if you were handling the raw pcb without proper grounding (to yourself or the board). Though the dangers of this are real they are generally exaggerated and I would look elsewhere first.</p>

    Hi I've just got the Axoloti Core board. I'm relying on the usb as the power source. When I connect to OS X 10.10.2 the LEDS blink and settle on the green light. When I go to 'Board Menu' and select 'Select Device' there is no device showing. The dialogue box shows this message: 

No available USB device found with matching PID/VID 

I replaced the micro usb cable to one that I know for certain transfers data - even so, no result. 

Any ideas? 

Thanks
