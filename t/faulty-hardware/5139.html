        <p>I have one board that does this too. I never found out exactly what is was, but I think someone told me it might be afried usb port..... And thats why you get the:</p>

<p>No available USB device found with matching PID/VID</p>

<p>I have absolutely NO idea why it happened and how to fix it, sorry..... or if its even possible.</p>

<p>I think <a class="mention" href="../../u/johannes.html">@johannes</a> is the right one to answer this question.</p>

  <blockquote>
    Hi I've just got the Axoloti Core board. I'm relying on the usb as the power source. When I connect to OS X 10.10.2 the LEDS blink and settle on the green light. When I go to 'Board Menu' and select 'Select Device' there is no device showing. The dialogue box shows this message: 

No available USB device found with matching PID/VID 

I replaced the micro usb cable to one that I know for certain transfers data - even so, no result. 

Any ideas? 

Thanks

        <p>Hi everyone,<br>Just wondering if you tried reinstalling the software on your computer?<br>I had a similar problem, everything worked one day and then the next it just stopped working, no changes were made as far as I could tell (from one day to the next). Initially I feared it may have been a hardware issue; however, I nuked all the axoloti software on my computer (Mac/OSX at the time) and reinstalled everything and I was back in business. If you are using a Linux-based system make sure you set properly the user permissions and udev rules for usb connectivity.<br>(If you don't know how to do this let me know and I'll walk you through it)<br>Additionally, if you have not already tested this, try connecting the axoloti core with a different USB cable, preferably a high quality data capable cable. If you've already tried this try again with another cable. My axoloti has been finicky with cables that otherwise function with some of my other dev boards.<br>If LEDs are coming online when the board is powered up odds are the hardware is functioning properly and there is a miscommunication between the board and your computer. In my experience it would be pretty difficult to damage the axoloti hardware unless you were doing something reckless (ie. injecting voltages where you shouldn't, or going well outside of voltage tolerances). That having been said there is the outside chance that your board suffered static shock damage. This could occur if you were handling the raw pcb without proper grounding (to yourself or the board). Though the dangers of this are real they are generally exaggerated and I would look elsewhere first.</p>

        <p>Lastly, and if you didn't read into the thread linked by <a class="mention" href="../../u/spacelordmother.html">@spacelordmother</a>, if all else fails try this:<br><aside class="quote" data-topic="2525" data-slug="no-available-usb-device-found-with-matching-pid-vid" data-post="2"><div class="title">

<blockquote><p>The symptoms you're reporting could be caused by a power-only USB cable, but you have already verified, great!  The next thing to exclude is anything related to firmware.  Could you try a "rescue flash": remove power from Axoloti Core, and then connect the micro-USB port to your computer while holding button S1. The LEDs will stay off when in DFU mode. Then select in the Board menu -&gt; Firmware -&gt; Flash (Rescue)... If the LEDs stay off, but you still get "No devices in DFU mode detected.", then …</p></blockquote></aside></p>
