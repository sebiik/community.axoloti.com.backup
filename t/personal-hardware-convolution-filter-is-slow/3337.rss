    <title>Personal Hardware: Convolution Filter is slow</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/personal-hardware-convolution-filter-is-slow/3337</link>
    <description>Hey guys I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s appropriate to ask this here, but it seemed like the best area. 

I&#39;m working on a convolution filter on custom hardware running a STM32F405 and a CS4270 codec running on the I2S in full-duplex. I&#39;ve done a couple of sample player projects on this platform that came out nicely. 

For this project I haven&#39;t been able to get more than about 400 taps to run on the CMSIS DSP FIR implementation using q15. This didn&#39;t seem right from what i&#39;ve read on the internet so I decided to test the idea on the Axoloti as a benchmark. As you all know the Axoloti performs significantly better. I haven&#39;t tested using the Discovery board version. That implementation is more similar to the hardware I&#39;m running, but I doubt hardware differences are big enough to see that type of performance difference. 

The code in the Axoloti convolution object looks very similar to the CMSIS code. I&#39;m running a bare-metal implementation using CubeMX and HAL. No RTOS. I even wrote a barebones interrupt handler for I2S DMA to avoid all the bloat in the HALmx version. Any ideas on where I&#39;m losing my processing time? All interrupts beside the Systick and the I2S dma interrupts are turned off.</description>
