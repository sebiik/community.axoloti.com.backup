    <title>Patch selection via midi what am I overlooking?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/patch-selection-via-midi-what-am-i-overlooking/3767</link>
    <description>Hi everyone,
I am quite sure I am overlooking something really elementary, but I can&#39;t figure out why my midi patch selector is not behaving the way I expect it to behave. I have copied and modded some effects from the community library and as a test I am now trying to use two notes on a midi keyboard to switch patches on the axo. 

Again, it is probably something very obvious but I can&#39;t figure it out...

EDIT: please ignore I figured it out and yes it was super basic level stuff :blush:</description>

              <p>Well in short, I made a patch that lets you use two notes on your Midi device to cycle through a selection of effects in a patchbank. What I did not think of was that you need to include this patch as a subpatch in every patch in the patchbank otherwise you are only able to choose the first effect. I can elaborate when I am at my studio again, now that I figured it out it seems so obvious I can't see how I overlooked it in the first place <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>Thanks a lot</p>
