    <description>As you know I&#39;m working on some next generation hardware as described here: https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/next-gen-and-mini-axoloti-hardware-discussion/5908/216

I want to compile a nice collection of patches that really push the hardware for performance testing. I&#39;m specifically interested in patches that expose issues with SD Card locking or stuttering. Patches that run into memory limitations either SRAM or SDRAM will also be useful. 

These can be patches that you have from the past or new patches you can make quickly to illustrate unexpected behavior.

Think of anything that can break or crash the current system, any situation where you noticed issues or were confused by something. Even if you have a patch that is only unstable some of the time or under certain circumstances, submit it and describe what happened.

As we go forward I want us to get in the habit of creating minimal test patches that expose specific issues. Try to give me the smallest possible patch that exposes the issue even if it came from some larger project you were working on. That will make it easier for me to resolve. This might be the single biggest way to contribute if you&#39;re not comfortable working on the internals: find bugs or issues, create minimal test patches that illustrate them. This makes it a lot easier for other developers to come in and fix issues too.

By the way, this thread should be specific to particular patches and firmware behavior, we&#39;ll deal with overall patcher issues separately.</description>

              <p>Definitely. I'm thinking further down the road a bit. I'm trying to think about ways to make the whole system more accessible.</p>

<p>There are power users familiar with the current system that will want absolute control. But then I think there are a lot of potential users that are turned off by that and might feel better about some complexity being handled by the system itself.</p>

<p>There are a lot of people out there I think that can understand programming synthesizers and could understand conceptually what is happening in a patch, but don't understand memory usage and stack traces, etc.</p>

<p>We need to balance both use cases. I definitely don't want to do anything that compromises the power user case.</p>

              <p>Hmmm I get this Idea but on the first sight I'm a bit skeptical. One of the things I like most about axoloti is that it's limits are quite well defined. Either the ram is full or not. Either CPU is full or not. In the first case it works reliably in the second not at all. In what you describe there isn't this clear control anyore.</p>

              <p>Object freezing is a great idea. I'm wondering if there might be a way that we could pull off something like this behind the scenes so the user doesn't have to manage it directly unless they want to. I'm thinking of sort of an "on-demand"/"lazy" system where non-essential features of a patch are static and consuming minimal resources until the user actually interacts with them. Rough concrete example: some object with tons of knobs only represents the "possibility" of having all those knobs; the backend waits to actually consume resources for it until the user changes the value.</p>

<p>It all comes back to "What is the absolute minimum work we can do to make the correct patch calculation right now?" And then being able to transition smoothly into higher resource usage as needed.</p>

<p>I like the Idea that you can load the objects that you'll actually need into the flash. But as it works now I rework almost every object because almost all objects have wasteful dials and stuff...</p>

<p>EDIT: Of course there will be more ram and everything but nowing myself I will bring that to limit too propably <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>On the other hand we do have an entire extra megabyte of flash available to us (we have 2MB over Core's 1). My intuition is that this is huge compared to the amount of data we need to store for objects if we're reasonably clever about not being wasteful when we store them.</p>

<p>Some objects need to be parameterized and stored more compactly. Take the basic example of mixer objects. Instead of having Mix1, Mix2, ..., Mix8 all stored separately, we want some kind of MixN that takes the number of inputs as a parameter and generates the appropriate object. This might be a behind the scenes optimization. At the patcher level, it could still be exact sizes like we're used to like Mix2, etc.</p>

              <p>Here's the patch linker script from master: <a href="https://github.com/axoloti/axoloti/blob/master/firmware/ramlink.ld" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/axoloti/axoloti/blob/master/firmware/ramlink.ld</a></p>

<p>So in the legacy system there's roughly 44k + 8k in SRAM regions and 48k in what's called "core-coupled" or CCMSRAM, then 8MB SDRAM.</p>

<p>The image is showing a new layout for the H7 that has about 512k of normal SRAM plus another 128k CCMSRAM for use with patches/dsp and then the 32M SDRAM. The patch I was running here uses more than twice what would be possible for CCM usage on the original hardware. Roughly we've got about 6x more SRAM and 4x more SDRAM to work with.</p>

<p>In both cases there are other regions of SRAM in use for other firmware purposes that aren't allocated to the patch. The H7 has about 1M of RAM overall.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have some ideas for reducing the effect of the SRAM bottleneck as we go forward. We're going to get some nice headroom without much work, but we still need to work on architecture improvements overall. There's a huge amount of Flash for us to work with. The H7 also has its nice L1 cache which is totally absent on the F4.</p>

              <p>The patch that I've appended is my first patch on Axoloti! It is an alpha  version of a 12 band vocoder. I intended on making a 31 terts band vocoder, but soon found out that this will demand too much resources on Axoloti. Therefore I scaled it down to 12 bands. Depending on the positioning of the elements of the patch in the gui it compiles or I get an error message telling me that there is an overflow. I hope this can be of some help in the further development of Axoloti. And if anyone uses it to make some music, please send me a link, I'd be very curious to know what people use it for. To use it, put a carrier signal on the right input and a modulator signal on the left input. The 12 resulting bands are panned a bit, so any signal should result in some stereo output signal. The vca + const/i elements are meant to scale the signals. Depending on your input signals you may have to adjust these.<a class="attachment" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/5/57fd85a7c854093b53d43729af5f98a2a96ff926.axp">vocode-o-matic_emulatie_12x12_banden_linear_03.axp</a> (73.2 KB)</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>From the literature and from anecdotal evidence there shouldn't be any advantage to running instructions from SRAM. People seem to observe that SRAM can actually be slower due to caching and CPU pipeline structure (One example: <a href="https://community.st.com/s/question/0D50X00009Xkh2VSAR/the-cpu-performance-difference-between-running-in-the-flash-and-running-in-the-ram-for-stm32f407" rel="nofollow noopener">https://community.st.com/s/question/0D50X00009Xkh2VSAR/the-cpu-performance-difference-between-running-in-the-flash-and-running-in-the-ram-for-stm32f407</a>). </p>

<p>The fundamental issue is that we're taking the special case, i.e. dynamically editing an object implementation, and applying it universally. It's over-engineered; there's no technical reason for it. Yes, it might be tolerable to deal with a compile cycle because your host machine is fast. That doesn't make it correct or desirable. Compilation should only occur when someone is changing an object implementation. This approach also has the effect of making everything harder to debug. If all of that object implementation code is compiled ahead of time, it's much easier for a debugger to be aware of all of those symbols.</p>

<p>The actual object implementation can remain largely the same whether in Flash or SRAM. You would simply call into object implementations in Flash as needed. I would argue that working from Flash would be easier overall because there could less concern about the exact positions of things in memory. The patcher right now actually has awareness of explicit memory addresses on the target device, again, for no real technical benefit. It's a very brittle design.</p>

<p>The patch load process could just as easily target Flash actually, but then we'd get into wear-leveling concerns, etc.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that the vast majority of patching could easily be done completely live without any compile cycle at all. It has the added bonus of actually being simpler to work with and to debug.</p>

<p>Ha, sorry if this all comes across as hyper-critical and doom and gloom! I'm just trying to make this thing the best it can possibly be. It bothers me that people are dealing with what I see as self-imposed technical limitations.</p>

              <p>Actual machine instructions for each patch object are also saved in SRAM, not just their data storage.</p>

<p>One approach I want to try eventually is to just put all of the factory objects in Flash. I'm of the opinion that this is probably how it should have worked from the beginning. The vast majority of objects never change, yet we're forcing ourselves to recompile them all the time.</p>

<p>With this approach the "patch" becomes lighter weight; most of the time we're referring to the factory objects that are already available in Flash. Objects that are being dynamically edited can still be loaded into SRAM as edits are taking place.</p>

<p>In other words, I think there are bottlenecks in the current system coming from the software architecture, not from the hardware itself.</p>

<blockquote><p>Still don't really get how the SRAM works, are there any threads explaining it? I mean, I get that for delays, allpasses, etc. you need some ram to store the audio, but it seems almost all objects, regardless if they use a buffer eat some sram away.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>For delays and tabes and so on, it is recommended to use the SDRAM version. Those object should have "SdRam" in the end of the name. That saves SRam. But yes I think you are right, pretty much any object uses some Sram, some more than others. And the really memory consuming ones, again, like delays etc. has their own SdRam versions.</p>
