        <p>Definitely. I'm thinking further down the road a bit. I'm trying to think about ways to make the whole system more accessible.</p>

<p>There are power users familiar with the current system that will want absolute control. But then I think there are a lot of potential users that are turned off by that and might feel better about some complexity being handled by the system itself.</p>

<p>There are a lot of people out there I think that can understand programming synthesizers and could understand conceptually what is happening in a patch, but don't understand memory usage and stack traces, etc.</p>

<p>We need to balance both use cases. I definitely don't want to do anything that compromises the power user case.</p>
