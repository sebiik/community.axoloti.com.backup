    <title>Strange Phase issues when using Delay objects</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/strange-phase-issues-when-using-delay-objects/1822</link>
    <description>hi,

i am trying to get a simple stereo Delay of about one second. building them with the delay write and read objects i allways get a slight phase offset betqueen them. it seems to be unavoidable..

i tested serveral things to find the reason:

a mono source at the analog inputs, both inputs get the same signal. after the analog outputs i mix bouht channels with one flipped in phase- so they should null themselfes.

&quot;blank&quot; patch just routing inputs to outputs- no issues- they completely null. 

patch with sd ram delay write and read objects- same setting- they. dont null anymore- phase relation has chanced.

patch with only one deleay write object and two read objects reading from the same adress as above: same result, chanels got out of phase... 

so it themes to be the delay read object causing the phase issue.. how might this come? no idea how to go on.. i realy need both chnanels to be in phase and delayd about a Second... its so simple task but seems to beimpossible with axoloti... 

any ideas?

<p>without seeing, so pretty randomly, the first thing id check is the execution order. perhaps one channel is being executed one exec cycle later that the other, which could create a 0.3mS phase offset.</p>

<p>example</p>

<p> <div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/63d0ed2d4062ccc5738e56f7c830f3df164ddd8b" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/6/63d0ed2d4062ccc5738e56f7c830f3df164ddd8b.png" class="lightbox" title="Screen Shot 2016-06-08 at 15.10.48.png"><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/63d0ed2d4062ccc5738e56f7c830f3df164ddd8b_1_690x280.png" width="690" height="280"><div class="meta">

<p>this cancels as expected, but if you move the delay/write (d2) down a little bit, you will see it doesn't phase cancel, as the write is executed after the read. i.e. its out by one execution cycle, giving a phase difference</p>

<p>is pretty obvious here, but these execution order issues can appear quite subtle at times.</p>
