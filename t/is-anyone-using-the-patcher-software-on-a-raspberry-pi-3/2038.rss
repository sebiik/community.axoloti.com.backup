    <description>Hi all, I&#39;ve done a search in the hardware/software sections and can&#39;t find an answer, has anyone used the patcher software on a raspberry pi 3 yet?  I don&#39;t have any specific plans, I&#39;m just curious as to what my options are with the axoloti core board and external hardware.</description>

<p>I agree, and actually I tried to stop it going off-topic way back, but you replied so it would have been rude to not reply back.</p>

<p>Well it looks like the Arduino, Teensy, and MicroPython boards will have to battle it out for my effection!</p>

<p>Thanks all for the insight and heads-up on them.  If nothing else, at least it gave me a better understanding of what PICAXE is.  I will still take a look at PICAXE though, I really like the system from what I've seen of it; it seems to be a very professional, well thought out system to me.</p>

<p>If you like BASIC on a small, slow, 8-bit microncontroller with limited RAM and flash, PICAXE might be just what you need.  Fine for flashing some LEDs, reading some switches.</p>

<p>The compiled/interpreted confusion comes from the fact that PICAXE doesn't store the actual BASIC program text on the chip. The BASIC source code is tokenized on the computer, which only reduces the amount of flash needed on the chip. The tokenized program is interpreted on the PICAXE chip.</p>

<p>If you want faster 32-bit microntrollers, there are lots of choices. STM32, Teensy, ESP8266, ESP32, etc.</p>

<p>Another thing to consider is that most of the open source software out there is written in C, C++, Python. Lots of good code to cut and paste, without having to reinvent the wheel.</p>

<p>For somebody learning how to use microcontrollers today, Arduino is a great choice</p>

              <p>G'day, mate <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/grin.png?v=5" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>

<p>It was similar for me, the first program I made was in BASIC on the Commodore 64, and here it is (slightly modified to give you nightmares):</p>

<p>10 Print "axoman"<br>20 Goto 10</p>

<p>I looked into the ESP boards suggested by tele_player and yourself, but I prefer the MicroPython board over those.  What has me confused is what Dave said in that video, cause first he says that PICAXE uses code that was compiled into the native Assembly language of the PICAXE, and then he says that it's slow due to being interpreted.  I just don't understand that at all.</p>

<p>I <em>do</em> understand that when working in the PICAXE programming environment, that you are working in BASIC, and that the simulation you see is a result of the BASIC code being interpreted.  But what I <em>don't</em> understand is why, if the BASIC code gets compiled to native PICAXE Assembly language, why the PICAXE itself would be running <em>anything</em> interpreted, if what it is running is native PICAXE Assembly language!</p>

<p>All options are open to me, I'll learn whatever I need to whether it be Arduino, PICAXE, or MicroPython, but that question above really does confuse me, I wish someone would explain that to me.  If not, I suppose I'll join their forum and ask when I get to play with the stuff.</p>

<p>Regards me being nuts ... whatever gave you that idea?</p>

<p>Listen mate, ever since my release from the asylum, nurse  has checked-up on me once a month without fail.  She says I'm getting along fine in society these days.  And mate, there's  a "<em>bloody</em>" good reason I'm attracted to a product called "PICAXE" <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/crazy_face.png?v=5" title=":crazy_face:" class="emoji" alt=":crazy_face:"></p>

              <p>I was originaly a basic programmer since the old days of spagheti programming with numbers, the old basca etc, led me right up to visual basic etc... When I wanted to try working with microcontrollers for the first time, naturaly PICAXE was my first direction, alot has changed since then, for first timmers its alot easier to get into PICAXE then when I first tried. There just wasn't sufficient info and direction available for me to work out how to get started. But by this time Arduino was out so I started reading about it, and I had no issues understanding what I needed to get started, the only issue I had was no experience in C Programming, so I started reading up about it, and to be honest, I found that it realy wasn't that different after all, if statements, loops, and so on, it was mostly just the syntax that was new. And I haven't looked back since. I am not saying you should go the Arduino route, but what I can definately say is that their is tons and tons of examples that you can copy from, ask for help on, every where for begginers to advance level concepts. And now that I have been using it for some time now, I have no interest to try anything new for now unless their is a benifit to do so. And now when I try to do some occaisional VB codding I find it clumsy, so I find that C has taught me to be more accurate and specific with what is happening. And its cheap to, you could get an ESP32 board for about $8, it has more then sufficient memory and speed to do what you want, and can be controlled over WIFI, and there are thousands of code example for free on line to source from.<br>But the choice is yours.... ps!.. your nuts if you don't at least consider it.  <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>

              <p>Scrap my rambling, just saw a video from Dave Jones where he mentioned PICAXE, and from what he says, it's interpreted, but he also mentions that it's assembler, so I'm totally confused now, but anyway, if it is interpreted, I suppose it's just a matter of testing these things to see if interpretation at 64MHz is good enough.</p>

<p>So you get to code in BASIC, an interpeted language, but the PICAXE itself is not interpreting anything because the software interpreted and converted it to Assembler before uploading it to the chip.  At least that's how I understand it, the system was designed for ease of use and speed.</p>

<p>As far as I'm aware, I could program in BASIC, the PICAXE software will convert it to Assembler, and when uploaded to the PICAXE itself, that Assembler gets to run at up to 64MHz depending on which PICAXE chip I use - I think it's a bloody good system <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/sunglasses.png?v=5" title=":sunglasses:" class="emoji" alt=":sunglasses:"></p>

              <p>Brilliant, so that's another I'm going to have to check out, thanks for pointing it out, I've never heard of it before!</p>

<p>It was PICAXE I was thinking of, though I should have said Assembler and not Machine Code (which I believe is basically a more human-readable adaption of machine code).</p>

<p>The PICAXE editor will let you program in BASIC, but will actually output Assembler for the chip.   It's a fantastic editor and system, you can even watch, pause, and edit a visual representation of the assembler, memory, and physical pins as your code runs (see the Simulation, Code Explorer, and Memory windows in this screenshot).<br><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/178f34647bc72bceee7ac087d7371656f71df897" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/1/178f34647bc72bceee7ac087d7371656f71df897.jpg" class="lightbox" title="image.jpg"><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/1/178f34647bc72bceee7ac087d7371656f71df897_1_666x500.jpg" width="666" height="500"><div class="meta">

<p>I remember early on when looking into this stuff, that PICAXE came across as being far more accessible and easier to program than Arduino.  Whether that be true or not, I have no idea as yet, but I also noticed that it requires less 'outboard' in a circuit than Arduino does.</p>

<p>The overall impression I get is that Arduino has stolen the spotlight due to its popularity, but PICAXE feels like a more sensibly though-out, less messy system than Arduino.  It just feels somehow more 'straight-to-the-point' than Arduino does (but bear in mind I'm making these comments as a noob to both, and don't even own a PICAXE yet).</p>

<p>There's six 'official' manuals for PICAXE, so to anyone who's not used the PICAXE system, this first manual will definitely give you an idea of how powerful and well thought out the PICAXE chip and software is ...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.picaxe.com/docs/picaxe_manual1.pdf" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.picaxe.com/docs/picaxe_manual1.pdf</a></p>

<p>Not hating on Arduino, but I'll be giving the PICAXE system a thorough workout regardless of whether I end up using it in products or not, cause to be honest, the only thing that could tip the scales in favour of the MicroPython board (or Arduino) would be if the largest of the PICAXE chips (the PICAXE-40X2) wasn't powerful enough.</p>

<p>So yup, really love the PICAXE system from what I've seen of it, and haven't even used one yet.  I'll be glad when I'm in a position to play with this stuff again, to compare and evaluate it for my needs.</p>

              <p>I've just been looking on both sites and can't find what I read before, so I haven't a bloody clue where I read it, but one of the programming/hardware solutions I looked into took either BASIC or Python, and turned it into native machine code for the chip to run.</p>

<p>What the hell, I can't think what else it would be if it weren't one of those!</p>

<p>Would a PICAXE be fast enough to drive a 320x240 display at a refresh rate of 60Hz?  I'm pretty sure the bare-metal MicroPython board could manage that, but I'm not so sure about a PICAXE.</p>

<p>I'm hoping to use whatever I learn in Python to work in MicroPython though, cause it's designed to run on that special MicroPython-based board I posted in the FPGA thread.  I'm under the impression that the Python code gets converted to bare-metal machine-code to make it fast.</p>

<p>Thanks for the insight, I know what you mean about having to declare variable types, and I believe memory management is another thing that makes the other languages harder (unless I misunderstood what I watched).</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the original discussion, I am definitely one of those interested in an RPi version.  In fact, if it worked nice (I know it might be a big if) on the new 4GB model, I would not be surprised if just about everyone warmed to it as their preferred Axoloti Patcher platform.</p>

              <p>You can basically do the same things graphically from either language, e.g. draw to OpenGL, use Qt, etc. Python is way, way slower in raw numerical performance, like on the order of 100 times slower. (Aside: Axoloti's patcher is using Java's included 2D drawing APIs rather than OpenGL etc which would probably be more efficient. There's nothing special about the choice of Java for 2D performance.). Distributing apps in either one is painful. For Java, you need a virtual machine available of the correct version. For Python, you need an interpreter. There are ways to sort of get around this and make the app look like a single package with all its dependencies, but it's a pain.</p>

<p>Semantically, Java and Python are not all that different. Python has an interpreter though, a Read-Eval-Print-Loop console that you can test commands in interactively. That's a big selling point for beginners. It's also highly dynamic; you don't need to declare types everywhere:<br></p>

<p></p><pre><code class="lang-python">pi = 3.1415</code></pre>

<p>vs Java or C-Like languages:<br></p>

<p></p><pre><code class="lang-java">float pi = 3.1415;</code></pre>

<p>When you have millions of lines of code, I think having a compiler be able to tell you that there's a type problem is really important and worth the effort of having to statically declare types, but that's a debated question.</p>

<p>Java and C-like languages have a lot of krufty syntactical detail that is painful to get right for an absolute beginner. Python strips a lot of that away.</p>

<p>On cross platform GUI apps: there are a bunch (like hundreds probably) of ways to achieve that now, and it's a confusing problem to tackle. Java was the old standard. A lot of people like Electron and similar now which is basically a web browser stack, i.e. HTML/CSS/JavaScript.</p>

              <p>Out of curiosity, do you have any idea why Johannes would have chosen to write the patcher in Java over Python?</p>

<p>It's purely my own curiosity cause I read Python runs everywhere without the need for 'porting', so I'm wondering what would have made Java more appealing when, if I'm understanding correctly, it is graphically intensive.</p>

<p>Personally I'd love to see a patcher for Raspberry Pi, especially now the 4GB version of Pi 4 is available.  It can run two 4K screens apparently, so it would seem odd if it couldn't handle the redrawing of a screen of objects connected with wires.  That said, while it can drive two 4K screens, I did also read that it's not capable of handling 4K video (which sounds a bit ridiculous to me).</p>

<p>Certainly though, use it at a more sensible 1080p and it's powerful enough to replace a desktop for many people since the 4GB Pi 4 arrived.</p>

<p>You know, I quite surprised really, that more of the larger softare companies aren't all over it.  The Raspberry Pi is actually the most popular motherboard/computer in the world now, and it runs Linux by default meaning you even get to escape the abusive Spy-OSs such as MacOS and Windows by owning one!</p>

<p>They seem to be targeting the desktop market now with those full-on desktop packages they sell, so that'll certainly help to make it a desktop replacement for many.</p>

              <p>Raspi 4 might actually be fast enough to run the existing patcher stack, but that's a band-aid solution. There's nothing that magical about the problem the patcher needs to solve that requires a ton of hardware. We should be able to do it on very resource constrained targets. Even a Pi Zero, etc.</p>

<p>The problem is mostly the efficiency of the patcher code, and also the efficiency of the "compile on live" approach. The patcher is currently Java-based, which isn't something that we can really optimize very heavily for Pi. It's basically the same code running on every platform inside that platform's JVM. So we're mostly deferring to the efficiency of the available JVM. We probably need to pick something that has higher raw rendering performance and can be compiled into native code for the Pi, possibly Qt or GLFW. Something that emits a native executable at the end and doesn't depend on a JVM or an interpreter.</p>

<p>Going live with a patch shouldn't actually launch the ARM compiler toolchain. If we can get to a lighter-weight messaging style architecture, it will be easier to make it really fast on the Pi. You'll run the compiler once up front or infrequently to update objects on your device, but then patching will only send very light-weight messages over the wire.</p>
