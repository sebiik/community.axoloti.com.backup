        <p>Hi all, I've done a search in the hardware/software sections and can't find an answer, has anyone used the patcher software on a raspberry pi 3 yet?  I don't have any specific plans, I'm just curious as to what my options are with the axoloti core board and external hardware.</p>

        <p>Same here,<br>I was looking for that yesterday. In fact any reference to any SBC dev board, Beagle Bone, Banana Pi, Cubie Truck.. etc Was able to find reference to using them as Midi devices, but can they run the patcher.</p>

        <p>this has come up a few times before, and a specific topic <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/raspberry-pi-zero-axo-masterkeyboard-display/705">here</a> ... my gut feeling was no, it not going to work well <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_frown.png?v=2" title=":slight_frown:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_frown:"> </p>

<p>anyway, I decided, really the only way to know 100% was to 'suck it and see'</p>

<p>so, I just installed axoloti on my Raspberry PI2 with a Linaro distribution.<br>(the linaro distro, is pretty good performance as Ive tried it on other things, PI2 as I don't have a PI3)</p>

<p>so , it took a bit of hacking of the build script for linux, and determining where to source packages etc, but I finally got it working! ...</p>

<p>I was able to run the UI, build/update firmwares, build patches, connect to axolotl, run and control patches on the axoloti.  - so yes, it works.</p>

<p>BUT... hold your horses, before you start popping champagne corks.</p>

<h1>Issues</h1>

<h2>CPU </h2>

<p>UI responsiveness, its practically its unusable...dialogs and dragging, wire connections are all painfully slow.<br>Axo core disconnects, I think this is cpu issue, basically not processing the axoloti USB events fast enough.</p>

<h2>Axo voltage low</h2>

<p>I was getting quite a few spurious errors/disconnects , when I had just a keyboard, mouse, wifi dongle and axo in the PI2, despite having a 2A power supply on the PI2 and no midi controllers in the PI or Axo</p>

<h1>Solutions?</h1>

<p>the low voltage is probably not an issue, simply use a powered hub in the  PI, and attach everything to that.<br>(its not uncommon for PI to have this issue, even worse on the BBB <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=2" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> ) </p>

<p>CPU, this is the harder thing to fix...<br>there is one fix we kind of know that will help... to do with USB polling frequency, which has been seen on other slower computers.<br>there have also been reports of issue under linux of high cpu, which could also contributing to it... but we don't have really an idea what this is.<br>also, Ive also feared the graphics performance on the PI is poor, with little hardware acceleration, compounded by lightweight processors, and i suspect this is the main culprit.</p>

<p>PI's generally don't have a lot of cpu power, I can see 'reasonable' load on the 4 cores, but interestingly they don't appear to be maxed out, and also whilst Axoloti is 'slogging away' doing its thing, the rest of X seems still responsive.</p>

<p>would it be ok on a PI3, frankly, I doubt it..  the pi3 is about  25% faster cpu, twice as fast cpu... and they claim its twice as fast at the PI2, but honestly, even if it was 4x the speed, it would still be not a very 'pleasant' experience.</p>

<p>I'll perhaps give it another test if we find and resolve and the performance issue under linux... but I'm not spending more time on it, its frankly very unlikely to be worth it.<br>it</p>

<p>Im sure others may want to try, and i can say if your 'confident' with linux packaging, and understand a build of shell (so you can edit build.sh) its not difficult.<br>but unfortunately, I can't really package my hacked solution, and its too time consuming to document/support others to do it, and more importantly there probably will be 'issues' with the patcher etc specific to the PI and i don't have time to look into these.</p>

<p>of course, if it does become useable, I will of course update the build scripts to allow others to build </p>

<p>anyway, was an interesting experiment <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=2" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>I have tried it a few times on my Novena, which uses a Freescale iMX6 chip, quad core with 4 gigs of RAM - not a speed demon compared to a PC, but no slouch either. I am quite sure it's faster than any Raspberry Pi, but I don't have the benchmarks to back that up.</p>

<p>I did not measure CPU usage much, the compiles were very slow and screen redrawing too slow to make it unusable as thetechnobear says. The graphics issues might be related to the drivers not providing enough or the right kind of 2D acceleration, or it might be because the JVM on ARM is much less optimized than on PCs (which I am assuming it is).</p>

<p>Either way, there's a bit to go I think.</p>

        <p>Thanks for taking a look <a class="mention" href="/users/thetechnobear">@thetechnobear</a> that's a shame, I thought cross-compiling for 'live' would be the thing that slowed it down rather than the ui.</p>

        <p>Thanks for testing. Maybe something to look much later down the track. These units are getting faster all the time, so maybe its just a matter of waiting.</p>
