    <title>Idea for MIDIpal type of patch</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/idea-for-midipal-type-of-patch/3729</link>
    <description>Hi everyone,
I am new to the community, new to axoloti (received my 1st core two days ago), and new to most of both programming &amp; sound synthesis vocabularies; basically, I am a hands-on type of noise maker* who has decided to jump in at the deep end. So please bare with me...

My question is this: would it be possible to remap separate incoming midi channels to a single outgoing midi channel? (e.g. incoming channels 1-16 forwarded to channel 2 of the connected midi device). This is a feature that I was told the MIDIpal / MIDIbro / MIDIgal offers, so I figured it may well be possible with an axoloti.
I have more or less read what there is to read on this subject in these pages, and I have come across the midi guitar topic and what I am looking for is similar (my sequencer sends 8 tracks as 8 separate channels, which I would like to convert to mono and combine into a single channel - as my midi device receives midi on one channel only), but I haven&#39;t come across an object that allows you to identify or detect the various incoming channels, let alone redirect them. I guess the midi/in/script object could be a start if I knew how to write scripts, which I don&#39;t.  

Well, that&#39;s it for my first public post on this forum! Thanks for reading/engaging :slight_smile:

              <p>It works, every midi channel I select on my sequencer goes through to a single designated channel on the slave device. Since my device is monophonic (Bastl Microgranny), routing 8 tracks to a single  channel means there is some interesting noisy side effects and note cut-offs happening. Thanks again!</p>

<p>yes, you can do what you want with scripting.<br>basically you need to just route midi/in/* objects to midi/out/* objects (cc,keybd) <br>if you place these in a subpatch, and in the settings make it a polyphonic multichannel, and select the max number of voices (16).</p>

<p>(ive not tested this, but it should work, as this type of subpatch receives all midi channels)</p>

<p>this is not identical to a midi thru, but its possibly close enough...</p>

<p>if you cant to do a strict midi thru, this is possible by altering the midi script (or my midi thru object), basically you just need to alter the status byte ,<br>something like</p>

<p></p><pre><code class="lang-auto"> int8_t out_channel = 0; // channels run from 0...15, not 1-16!)
 status  = status &amp; 0xf0 + out_channel;</code></pre>

<p>please note... sysex cannot be forwarded in this version of the Axoloti firmware.</p>
