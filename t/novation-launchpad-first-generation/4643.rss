    <title>Novation Launchpad First Generation</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/novation-launchpad-first-generation/4643</link>
    <description>Hello,

does anybody uses a first generation **Novation Launchpad**? 
I did a fast test with mine but seems that it is not working (sending or receiving notes)
I think it is not a standard plug and play device (as its newer versions), for instance I use a launch control without any problems but finding a way to use it will be very useful.

Thanks in advance,
Daniele</description>

<p>edit: googling linux related resources shows that i'm probably right, since original launchpads were recognized by linux systems, but did not work, while class compliant devices are working right out of the box.</p>
