    <title>Is there a way of &quot;saving&quot; the patch position when played live?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/is-there-a-way-of-saving-the-patch-position-when-played-live/4674</link>
    <description>Sorry if this one has been asked before:

If I have a patch loaded to flash with some pots attached to GPIO, every time I switch the axoloti on the patch obviously resets. Without attaching to a computer to continuously save this param changes (as the Ax is loaded into my live rig, which doesn&#39;t use my laptop), is there a way that the patch can &quot;track&quot; the final position of the knobs, so that when I boot up the axoloti again the patch is still in that position? The same way a guitar pedal, or analogue synth, would work.

It sucks when I&#39;ve found a really nice combination on the pots, then come back to it the next day and the patch is rebooted from scratch.</description>

              <p>Yeah just connect a ctrl/i set to 1 to the 2 inlets of the table load object.</p>

<p>Save have to be done manually, every time BEFORE leaving the patch. I dont know how to that automatically.</p>

<p>You are probably going to play around with it for a while to get it working 100%, but it will work and its probably the cheapest/simplest way, dsp vise, to add presets. Use the SD-ram version of the table.</p>

<p>Axolotis own preset system is.... Just too much of a hassle working with. I mean, you have to assign each value to each parameter individually........... It takes forever just making a single preset. I personally really think this system should be dropped and instead make something that is a bit more 21 century.</p>

<p>Ahh, also,,, Sorry forgot about this yesterday, but You can also check <a class="mention" href="/u/drjustice">@DrJustice</a> contributions, he has made a presets manager that you can try out too.</p>

              <p>Hey that's awesome - thanks Jaffa!</p>

<p>On this point - is there a way of it kind of auto-saving and loading? So, at a guess: a cycling device (sine wave?) "triggers" the table/save function rather than hitting a switch, and then there is some kind of table autoload when the patch is initiated?</p>

              <p>You could use tables to store the data from the potentiometers, by routing them through a table, before sending the data to it's respective destinations. And then you simply just have to save the table before going offline and then you can recall it when laoding a patch again.</p>

<p><strong>To store the data in table:</strong><br>Potentiometer &gt; table/write </p>

<p><strong>And then to send the data to the destination:</strong><br>table/read &gt; parameter destination</p>

<p>Then use a table/save and a table/load to save and load the data.</p>

<p>I think that could work <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
