    <title>Serial pin in schematic</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/serial-pin-in-schematic/3086</link>
    <description>Hi,
i&#39;m confused...
In &quot;AXOLITI In/Out Overwiev&quot; and in the /gpio/serial/config object serial pins are PA2 for TX and PA3 for RX. In the schematic on page 6 is a table where RX is PB7 and TX is PB6.
I think this must be a mistake while PA2/PA3 seems to work.
Am I right? I&#39;m just planning my hardware extensions to core and this must be correct.
Thanks

              <p>Hi,<br>too bad. I thought so. It would have been better if the pins had located on PB. You want as many potentiometers as possible. And so unfortunately one has two less. <br>I will make the connections switchable, depending on how it is needed. That's how I'll do it with the spi interface. If I use relays, which are driven by drivers of output pins, I can then also let the software control.</p>

<p>But the problem remains: the data in the current schematic seem to be wrong. I hope the routing is at least correct...</p>

<p>Thanks in advance<br>Uwe</p>
