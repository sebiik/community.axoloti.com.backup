    <description>hello I have been working on some patches to run into a simple eurorack system... I&#39;m still working on building up my eurorack so its just one module at the moment. I have been waiting on a mother 32 for ever. anyways I have been trouble creating triggers by multiplying the gate and velocity. perhaps this is a naive approach however it seems to work fine mono-phonically. however it does not seem to function in a polyphonic patch. &lt;a class=&quot;attachment&quot; href=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b4f72e1237d345112f7bce455ab0003129150c1e.axp&quot;&gt;heyoh.axp&lt;/a&gt; (1.0 KB)&lt;a class=&quot;attachment&quot; href=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c3e50e7c69f8540754fd601af3e85e190d6acdd9.axs&quot;&gt;poly1chan.axs&lt;/a&gt; (6.0 KB) this version of the subpatch is working fine with just gates.  here is the patch where i multiply &lt;a class=&quot;attachment&quot; href=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8987052cfc8f58244986cefbd32bb655892923be.axs&quot;&gt;polytriggersnotworking.axs&lt;/a&gt; (6.0 KB) gate and velocity. I am getting a trigger out of pa5 but not pa4. I thought perhaps the problem was with a the polyphonic midi ctr object but realized I was misunderstanding what that object was for and have replaced it with a monophonic midi input. if you decide to run these patches please turn your volume down. I created this patch to run into mutable instruments streams (dynamic gate processor) so its just straight Oscillation.  @technobear I thought perhaps I was having trouble due to an object but now i think its something wrong with my patching.</description>

              <p>Yes sorry the patch is a mess of weirdness. I probably should have cleaned it up first and just included one oscillator to simplify things. I will give this a try. Interestingly enough I was able to get two different gate signals coming out with this method however things broke down when I tried to change them to triggers by multiplying the velocity. The outlets is a great<br>Idea as I will be able to monitor the signals with a display object to see what going on and make sure I'm sending out the right signals. I will not be able to work on this for the next week however once I have everything set up I will share a video. I am essentially using the axoloti as 2 digital oscillators and gate/trigger cv to send into mutable instruments streams. This allows all sorts of interesting combinations with envelope following and vactrol simulation that I would struggle to come up with a patch for. I am really excited about combining the digital and analog realms. Thanks everyone for their patience, axoloti has pushed me into new realms of learning.</p>

              <p>Trying to follow your intentions, not 100% sure here.</p>

<p>You're using "gpio/out/analog" in a polyphonic subpatch. This object is written with the assumption that there is only one instance of it. <br>(unlike audio/out/..., different audio output objects will mix together)</p>

<p>The solution: add two "patch/outlet f"'s to your poly subpatch, and move the "gpio/out/analog" object to the parent patch.</p>
