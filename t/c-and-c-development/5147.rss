    <description>Is there a way to write code similar to arduino. I would like to be able to import C libraries from the GNU community and also use the developers kit. Are there headers and libraries in C/C++ for user compiling, to access the hardware features? I want that ability for sure. Maybe your patcher will grow on me, but this board has excellent features if i could access it in C.</description>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/u/georgerosar">@georgerosar</a> the short answer is yes <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>but all platforms are different, so the how to do this varies.<br>with axoloti, the best way to integrate C/C++ code is by creating an object, that represents the 'functionality' you wish to create - in this object you have access to the hardware api exposed by the firmware.</p>

<p>this approach means you can write in C/C++ your functionality, but still use within the patching framework to gain functionality you don't want to write yourself.</p>

<p>you can also of course, look at the 'factory' objects (which are in C) and see how they interact with the hardware....</p>

<p>of course, you could ignore all this, and just write one object that does it all â€¦ or even just create the entire patch from scratch  - writing your own xpatch.cpp</p>

<p>you could of course, just ignore the whole axoloti software and use it as a hardware board, and modify its firmware (its all open source), but that is a lot of work <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>at the end of the day, I think axoloti is great because not only can you patch together with objects, but these objects are just 'bundles of C code', so its easy to tie in new C code too...</p>

<p>what do you specifically have in mind? <br>what are you trying to achieve?</p>

<p>using libraries: honestly that's a can of worms, what do they do? do you have the source? are they compiled for arm/optimised for the specific ARM chip? do they address the right hardware?<br>(reality is you might be able to use some generic libs with a bit of adaptation, but hardware specific libraries are of course not going to work)</p>

<hr>

<p>fyi, this is often how I treat axoloti, and also things like Pure Data, <br>I write my code in C++, and then I use the patcher as a 'glue' , a way to link things together, and do deal with things I don't want to have to write. (perhaps midi or voice handling) </p>

<p>the next version of the axoloti also has a big step forward (imo, but Im biased as I wrote it <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ) in this area. it introduces 'modules' these allow you to build C libraries, that can be used/shared across objects.</p>
