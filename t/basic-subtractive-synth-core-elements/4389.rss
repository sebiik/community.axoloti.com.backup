    <title>Basic subtractive synth - core elements</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/basic-subtractive-synth-core-elements/4389</link>
    <description>After working through the tutorials and reading the [Axoloti book](http://community.axoloti.com/t/getting-started-with-axoloti-the-book/122/3) @janvantomme I came up with my first synth.

It&#39;s architecture is quite basic and loosely based on the TB303 and sounds familiar.

My main goals in creating this synth were to get a better understanding of the Axoloti an how to create some functions elementary to subtractive synths.

The following features are included:

- mixing OSC-waveforms
- modulating a filter with an envelope with varying amount
- filter key tracking with amount
- Legato glide with glide time control
- Pitchbend with range control
- applying several modulation sources to one modulation target (PB+glide-&gt;OSC-Pitch and Env-Amount+Key-Track-Amount-&gt;Filter-Pitch)
- two switchable &quot;Amp&quot;-Channels: clean and distortion
- mapping Midi CC#01 (Mod-Wheel) to the envelope amount control to the filter

Maybe this patch is interesting to other new Axoloti users...so I am happy to share it. :slight_smile:
