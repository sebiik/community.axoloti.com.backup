    <title>What does the polyindex object actually do?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/what-does-the-polyindex-object-actually-do/2961</link>
    <description>Hello :) 

I was wondering if anyone could describe what the polyindex object exactly do? I know it is used for many things, like panning voices of a polyphonic subpatch or offset the pitch on voices in a polyphonic subpatch. 

But what I am curious about is how much does the poly index affect the voices? How much are the second, third, forth voice values offset? 

For example pitch: is the first voice pitched 0 and the second voice pitched +1 and third voice pitched +2? 

Or is first voice 0, second +1, third -2, forth +3?   (Unipolar/Bipolar)

@johannes ?

Thanks, Jaffa</description>

              <p>I think the polyindex object is nice for many things. But one thing I am having a little bit og problems with is using it with panning. When connected to a pan object, it will start with voice zero in center and them move each voice +1 to the right. With pan it would be super nice that it moved every second voice to minus instead of plus... So it would be panned:<br>Voice1 +1<br>Voice2 -2<br>Voice3 +3<br>Voice4 -4</p>

<p>How would I go about doing that?</p>

<p>Ah cool, that was what I was trying to figure out.</p>

<p>Yeah, I guess I am actually using the sampler in unisono mode and then each of the voice copies are offset a little bit.</p>

<p>modulo - remainder e.g. 7 % 2 = 1 , 6 % 2 = 0, <br>so nice for detuning , e.g. odd voices -5 cents, even +5 cents , then perhaps multiply by division so you get something like +5, -5, +10, -10, +15, -15 etc ...</p>

<p>But I am really curious about how much it offsets for example the pitch of an oscillator pr voice. If i just connect the polyindex directly to the pitch inlet of an oscillator in a polyphonic subpatch. Like this:</p>

<p><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3a71d6f2d05bc61f37ce960da49eb93e8ddb0cd8.png" width="308" height="175"></p>

<p>Each voice is probably offset by something by default. And I was wondering if it was:<br>Voice 0 = offset 0 pitch<br>Voice 1 = offset +1 pitch<br>Voice 2 = offset +2 pitch<br>etc...</p>

<p>Hmm modulo? what is that?</p>

<p>Maybe I need to give an example:</p>

<p>I have a patch with a sampler in a subpatch, which is polyphonic. It has 3 voices, which mean it plays back the sample 3 times on top of each other. They sound totally identical.  Everything inside the subpatch  is basically played back 3 times, which just makes the sound a lot louder and nothing more. But when you connect the polyindex to for example the pitch, the lfo speed inside the subpatch(the voice), then those parameters will be offset a little bit for each voice. (as on the picture)....</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/thetechnobear">@thetechnobear</a> If you have got a VIrus synth, then in the edit menu you have also got some parameters for voice feature. Like pitch of oscillator offset pr. voice., lfo speed offset pr voice. Check it out if you got one.  You can also use it in context with unisono if I remember correct, where it also just plays the same sound 3 times. Each layer of the unison mode is offset  and it is adjustable how much it is offset.</p>

<p>however, probably my most common use for it, is to index into a table in the parent patch.  </p>
