    <title>Tagging topics enabled</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/tagging-topics-enabled/2065</link>
    <description>Ive enabled tagging of topics on the forum.  (and also the ability to filter)

perhaps in the long run this might help users find key topics..

- anyone that has been here awhile (level 3) can create tags, but obviously try to re-use as much as possible.
- you can only tag at the topic level (i.e. as the topic creator) , you can edit/add tags later
- when adding multiple tags, press tab between each one. (otherwise it will combine into multi word tags)

we could bulk update topics with tags, by searching and adding, but i don&#39;t think its worth it, as you&#39;ll get the same results if you do a simple word search.  (and i don&#39;t have the time to selectively go through posts adding tags) 

IF you have a handful of really good posts that you think would be good to tag (and you cannot add, as your not the owner)... 
then comment below with a link and suggested tag, if you don&#39;t include a link, I&#39;m not going to search for it ;) 

(again, only a handful of links don&#39;t do a search and expect me to sift through them for &#39;good hits&#39;, I just don&#39;t have the time.)

also if you have recommendations for tags feel free to suggest.. (though easier if it has a topic to show its use!), 

id suggest...  thing thats are not already a category e.g. we dont need programming/hardware, as they are categories.
things that can already be searched/filtered e.g. user posts are already searchable.
I guess I prefer one word tags, but I dont know how realistic this is :)</description>
