        <p>Okay, I fixed the issue. Turns out, I had wrong values for <code>I0</code> and <code>A</code>. I was basically taking wrong readings from the chart in the datasheet.<br>Now, with the values corrected, this is the new plot:<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/aa1b949a043c208cecbb92e2f1c33d90a6516922" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/a/aa1b949a043c208cecbb92e2f1c33d90a6516922.png" class="lightbox" title="model_distorted_saw_fixed.png"><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/a/aa1b949a043c208cecbb92e2f1c33d90a6516922_1_666x500.png" width="666" height="500"><div class="meta">

</div></a></div><br>which looks fairly similar to the real scope shot.</p>

<p>I added the second diode antiparallel to the first to make the distortion circuit complete. In the model, simply only one diode is conductive at a time, which is a good approximation, given that the reverse current in these diodes is so incredibly small.</p>

<p>I then copied the lookup table that was generated by the script into a new axoloti object and added the code that does the interpolation. Right now, it converts to float and does everything super unoptimized. That's why it consumes around 10% CPU (for a simple lookup table read, lol!)<br>Anyway, here's the object for you to play with:<br><a class="attachment" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d9caa4b219c1c7955568d7e6477ce23adeabb506.axo">diodeDist.axo</a> (3.2 KB)</p>

<p>Here is a audio demo comparing the real distorted drums to the model (real first, model second):<br><a class="attachment" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/6/65392b0933ed79c9bfef2fe3adb49b0c069bbb70.axp">real_vs_model.flac.axp</a> (443.2 KB - please remove *.axp file extension)<br>I can barely hear a difference. To my ears, the model lacks a little bit of top end, but that could just be a subjective thing. I'd say, it's close enough - probably not worth adding any additional stuff to this model, it would only make the computation more CPU intensive.<br>On the oscilloscope, the real signal and the model look identical now.</p>

<p>Funny, that was way simpler than I had expected.</p>

        <p>The optimized (still beta) version can now be found in the community library. <code>TSG/dist/diodeDist.axo</code><br>It consumes roughly 6% CPU (still too much if you ask me)</p>

<p>One thing that I found difficult is getting rid of noise introduced by the lookup table. For medium distortion settings and a table size of 256, only the lowest 4 values were actually used! The introduced noise was clearly audible. I tweaked the values a little bit and reduced the maximum available distortion level. Also I increased the size of the table to 1024 values. Now the noise is not audible anymore. Still, it's kind of silly to have a large lookup table, when most of the time you only really use the lowest quarter of it. It would actually be better, if there were more values in the lower ranges and fewer in the higher ranges (were the distortion will mask away any noise that may be introduced by reading from the table).</p>

<p>I'm thinking, a way out of this may be to have multiple, smaller lookup tables for different regions of the curve instead of one single table for the whole curve. I could then dynamically switch between the different tables, depending on where on the curve my input value is. Let's say I originally had a table with 1024 values for the whole input range of -1&lt;28 to 1&gt;&gt;28. That would mean, each value in the table spans over 1&lt;&lt;18 steps of the input.<br>I could instead have one table of size 512 for the whole range (step size would be 1&lt;&lt;19) and an additional table of size 512 for the range of -1&lt;&lt;22 to 1&lt;&lt;22 (stepsize would be 1&lt;&lt;13). That would be the same memory footprint, but orders of magnitude better resolution in the critical low ranges of the waveform.<br>The processing would be only marginally more complicated:</p>

<pre><code>if (input &lt; (1&lt;&lt;22))
{
    // read from small table
}
else
{
    // read from big table
}</code></pre>

<p>So that would be an additional shift, subtract and conditional jump operation - that's only very little increase. I'll try this tomorrow and see if the noise can be reduced further.</p>

<blockquote><p>[...] have your table be in log scale, [...]</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>Yes, but scaling the read index and the fractional would be way too complicated and cost a lot of CPU.</p>

<p>It dawned on me, that lookup tables are not ideal for this application.</p>

<ul>
<li>Not the exact shape of the curve is important (some deviation there wouldn't be problematic) but how smooth the interpolated waveform would be (first order deviation must be continuous)</li>
<li>The curve itself is very smooth - a low order polynomial would already be sufficient to approximate the curve well enough.</li>
</ul>

<p>From there on, its simply a matter of fitting a polynomial into the desired curve. The only important thing is that this polynomial would have to be symmetrical to the origin.<br>After I realizes that, it dawned on me that this pretty much directly leads to the typical curve found in the <code>dist/soft</code> object in the factory library, which implements this function: <code>y=1.5*x-0.5*x^3 for -1&lt;x&lt;1, y=-1 for x&lt;-1, y=1 for x&gt;1</code><br><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/5/590efa162064614ed597aad70bc860f0431facb5.jpg" width="658" height="406"></p>

<p>So - yea - unless I wanted to specifically model the 1N4148 circuit I have here on the breadboard, I could just stop here because I would basically recreate something that exists already.</p>

<blockquote><p>What if you fit the function with taylor expansions around several points and weigh the single contributions with a table?</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>That is actually a very nice idea! I wonder how complicated this would get, computation wise. I spent half of this morning trying to fit some polynomials into my curve. I was able to get halfway decent results with 2nd-order polynomials, but only if I split the whole curve into 100 2nd order polynomial sections. The problem with this is that low order polynomials are easy to compute but you need many of them to get decent results. On the other hand you can also (sometimes) get good results with a few high order polynomials - which saves memory but requires many additional multiplications, making it a poor solution for low-powered processors like Axoloti. Right now with my 100 2nd order sections, I don't really save enough memory  to justify the increased processing effort.</p>

<p>Coming back to your idea with the weighted taylor sections: I think the same tradeoff applies here. If I use higher order taylor expansions for this, it will be too computationally expensive. If I use lower order taylor expansions, I need more of them, mitigating the benefits alltogether. I might, however get less noise compared to the linear interpolated lookup table.</p>

<p>PS: I also tried to use 5th order polynomials, which are constrained to three points of the curve and the steepness on the points where they touch each other. However, there's still a problem in my equations, I keep getting poorly conditioned equation systems that can't be solved.</p>

<blockquote><p>explain how you derived your equation</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>A few posts back I wrote the equation and also posted an image of the circuit I used to model this.<br>As you can see, I assumed the operational amplifiers as "perfect amplifiers", so they appear only as abstract amplification blocks, except for the second amplifier, which has a finite input impedance of 47k, which i modeled with resistor Ri.</p>

<p>Now we need the basic equations of each components.<br>For the resistor, the current/voltage relationship is defined by Ohm's law: <code>R = Ur/Ir</code>. For the 1k resistor: <code>Ur=10*Uin - Ud</code> (<code>Ud</code> is the voltage at the node connecting the diode and the resistor relative to ground.) So that gives: <code>Ir = (10*Uin - Ud)/R</code>. For the 47k resistor that models the imput impedance of the following amplifier stage: <code>Ur = Ud</code>, so that gives: <code>Iri = Ud/Ri</code><br>For the Diode, the relationship is <code>Id = I0 * (exp(A*Ud) - 1)</code>, where <code>A</code> and <code>I0</code> are constants that I read from the datasheet. This is the very basic diode equation you will find in every textbook or on every website. Except that I concentrated three values into one constant, <code>A = q/nkT</code> - I don't need to know them all individually.</p>

<p>From  there on it's Kirchhoffs law: All currents flowing into a node have to cancel each other out. That leads directly to the equation posted above.</p>

<p>Maybe, you can have a look at Chebychev polynomials approximation. These approximate a function over a segment rather than around a single point.</p>

        <p>Yesterday I talked to a friend about my efforts in understand analog modelling. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIChUOV_0w4" rel="nofollow noopener">He recommended me to this talk.</a> I just watched it and its a wealth of precious information for a beginner like me, and I'm sure everyone here can find some nice inspiration in this - not only for modelling circuits, but also for some general creative patching ideas.</p>

<p>Feedback loops will occur pretty much anywhere, even the circuit I worked on here has feedback, which you can directly see from the form of the equation - it is implicit! To deal with these equations, he suggests to use the Newton Raphson algorithm. I knew about this and the numerical solver in python probably uses this algorithm or something similar. But hadn't thought about using it in real time, because it is very CPU hungry and depending on your exit condition for the algorithm, it can also take different number of iterations to get to a desired result, or not get any result at all - which is something very undesireable in a DSP environment. <br>One interesting note here is that he suggests to use lookup tables to do the first iterations of the Newton Raphson algorithm, speeding things up immensly. This is something I hadn't yet though of. You don't even need a lot of precision in these tables and you could probably get along just fine with uninterpolated tables - if you use them for the first few iterations of the algorithm, that will get you close to the solution of the implicit equation. You can then refine the result further by doing the last few iterations with the real, CPU hungry equation.</p>

        <p>Ok, maybe taylor approximation is not the correct solution. What if instead you do this?</p>

<p>1) the function is antisymmetric, so you don't actually have to fit the whole curve<br>2) divide the interval in which you want to fit the function in n+1 sections (better if equally spaced).<br>for each section Si (from x[i] to x[i+1]) you could define a II order polynomial like:</p>

<p></p><pre><code class="lang-auto"> 
a[i] + b[i]*x + c[i]*x^2</code></pre>

<p>This gives you a total of 3*(n+1) coefficients to determine.<br>3) for the sections S[0], .. , S[n-1] you can define two congruency equations:<br></p>

<p></p><pre><code class="lang-auto">a[i]+b[i]*x[i+1] + c[i]*x[i+1]^2 = a[i+1]+b[i+1]*x[i+1] + c[i+1]*x[i+1]^2 (continuity)
b[i] + 2*c[i]*x[i+1] = b[i+1] + 2*c[i+1]*x[i+1] (continuity of the first derivative)</code></pre>

<p>that make up for 2*n constraint equations.<br>4) You can already say that a[0] = 0 (this makes for another constraint equation)<br>5) The number of degrees of freedom if 3*(n+1) - (2*n+1) = n+2 </p>

<p>Your objective is that to minimize the distance between the sampled function and the polynomial approximation, so that sum(j) (f(x[j])-p(x[j]))^2 -----&gt;0</p>

<p>It's a constrained minimization problem, that you can solve numerically (octave, matlab) by the method of lagrange multipliers.</p>

        <p>Okay, so I think I'm pretty much done with this simple diode circuit. The final version, which is uploaded to the community library, uses two lookup tables - one for the lower 1/8th of the input range (high resolution), and one for the remaining 7/8 (lower resolution)<br>I was not getting anywhere with any other approximation I've tried - polynomials, weighted taylor expansions, segmented polynomials - it was all either too inaccurate or simply not worth the additional computation cycles. In the end the best performance-to-computation ratio was the dual-lookup table method. And given the large program memory of the STM32, it doesn't really affect anything to have a large lookup table somewhere in the flash (to my knowledge, const global variables will be put into the flash memory - or am I wrong here?)<br>Still, the object consumes ~4% CPU which is a little too much for my taste, but meh, I'm not gonna optimize this further.</p>

<p>The factory <code>dist/soft</code> (which is a simple polynomial distortion) consumes ~0.5% CPU but sounds a little less dirty to my ears. The diode distortion has more pleasing overtones, but if CPU cycles are a concern, I'd consider the factory version the better choice.</p>

<p>So the next circuit I'd like to takle is the Moog CP3 mixer. This is another relatively simple circuit (I hope), but it has plenty of interesting characteristics, including </p>

<ul>
<li>different distortion on its positive and negative outputs, </li>
<li>a type of distortion that enhances the bass instead of cutting it away</li>
<li>a kind of compression due to the way the mixbus is designed (ducking the other inputs when you increase the volume of a channel)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is said to be a substantial part of the massive sound of a Moog modular. So, let's see how much of that Mojo we can recreate on the Axoloti, shall we?</p>

<p><a href="https://learningmodular.com/exploring-the-moog-cp3-type-mixer/" rel="nofollow noopener">Here's the original schematic and a video showing some of the interesting features of this mixer</a>. I'm going to build the mixer after the <a href="https://www.muffwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=158439" rel="nofollow noopener">schematics from this clone</a> which contains only the typical parts every DIYer will probably have somewhere in their drawer.</p>

<p>I'll be off to visit my family during the festive season, but I'll be tackling this in the new year. If anybody want's to start working on this, I'll happily follow along, but I won't have time to actually build the real thing in the next few weeks.</p>

        <p>The 24dB/oct filter in tiar/filter/MgExp replicates the frequency response of the filter with a specific "ZDF" method (step invariant transform). It allows fast modulation without glitches and stable high resonance even with high cutoffs...</p>

<p><strong>but</strong>...</p>

<p>It does not implement any <strong>non linearities</strong>. It is a personal choice as - contrarily to a vast majority of analog synth addicts - I consider that stage distortions/saturations have a moderate impact on the tone in that steep Low Pass filter. I think that the main concern here are dynamics when modulating the cutoff.</p>

<hr>

<p>The transistor based mixer is another story ! <br>When i see the schematics, i guess that its non linearities <em>cannot be neglected at all</em>.<br>Maybe the best way to experiment with it is to model it with Spice at first (before building a hardware replica).</p>

<p>Non linear mixing is very interesting as it adds <em>intermodulations</em> between the inputs.</p>

<p>I did a simple non linear mixer object (tiar/dist/SqrtMix4 object and help patch) that is based on squares (as in x²) and square root. It is not based on any hardware but it can give some ideas for an advanced design.</p>

        <p>Happy new year! How's this project going? If it's too complicated, maybe you can try one of Korg's single-transistor VCA designs.</p>

For medium distortion settings and a table size of 256, only the lowest 4 values were actually used! The introduced noise was clearly audible. I tweaked the values a little bit and reduced the maximum available distortion level. Also I increased the size of the table to 1024 values. Now the noise is not audible anymore. Still, it's kind of silly to have a large lookup table, when most of the time you only really use the lowest quarter of it. It would actually be better, if there were more values in the lower ranges and fewer in the higher ranges (were the distortion will mask away any noise that may be introduced by reading from the table).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI'm thinking, a way out of this may be to have multiple, smaller lookup tables for different regions of the curve instead of one single table for the whole curve. I could then dynamically switch between the different tables, depending on where on the curve my input value is. Let's say I originally had a table with 1024 values for the whole input range of -1\u0026lt;28 to 1\u0026gt;\u0026gt;28. That would mean, each value in the table spans over 1\u0026lt;\u0026lt;18 steps of the input.\u003cbr\u003eI could instead have one table of size 512 for the whole range (step size would be 1\u0026lt;\u0026lt;19) and an additional table of size 512 for the range of -1\u0026lt;\u0026lt;22 to 1\u0026lt;\u0026lt;22 (stepsize would be 1\u0026lt;\u0026lt;13).

I wonder how complicated this would get, computation wise. I spent half of this morning trying to fit some polynomials into my curve. I was able to get halfway decent results with 2nd-order polynomials, but only if I split the whole curve into 100 2nd order polynomial sections. The problem with this is that low order polynomials are easy to compute but you need many of them to get decent results. On the other hand you can also (sometimes) get good results with a few high order polynomials - which saves memory but requires many additional multiplications, making it a poor solution for low-powered processors like Axoloti. Right now with my 100 2nd order sections, I don't really save enough memory  to justify the increased processing effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eComing back to your idea with the weighted taylor sections: I think the same tradeoff applies here. If I use higher order taylor expansions for this, it will be too computationally expensive. If I use lower order taylor expansions, I need more of them, mitigating the benefits alltogether. I might, however get less noise compared to the linear interpolated lookup table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePS: I also tried to use 5th order polynomials, which are constrained to three points of the curve and the steepness on the points where they touch each other. However, there's still a problem in my equations, I keep getting poorly conditioned equation systems that can't be solved.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":12,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-12-14T13:06:58.075Z","reply_count":2,"reply_to_post_number":11,"quote_count":1,"avg_time":16,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":75,"score":25.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":4013,"topic_slug":"modelling-analog-circuits-in-software","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"primary_group_flair_url":null,"primary_group_flair_bg_color":null,"primary_group_flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1129,"hidden":false,"hidden_reason_id":null,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":false,"wiki":false},{"id":25442,"name":"Mark Harris","username":"thetechnobear","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/community.axoloti.com/thetechnobear/{size}/6_1.png","created_at":"2017-12-14T14:55:16.212Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003ecould you possibly explain how you derived your equation in more detail?\u003cbr\u003eIt’s not something I’ve seen before, or perhaps reference something I could read up on.\u003cbr\u003eThanks\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":13,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-12-14T14:55:16.212Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":6,"quote_count":0,"avg_time":14,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":71,"score":19.9,"yours":false,"topic_id":4013,"topic_slug":"modelling-analog-circuits-in-software","display_username":"Mark Harris","primary_group_name":null,"primary_group_flair_url":null,"primary_group_flair_bg_color":null,"primary_group_flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"reply_to_user":{"username":"TheSlowGrowth","avatar_template":"/letter_avatar_proxy/v2/letter/t/90db22/{size}.png"},"actions_summary":[],"moderator":true,"admin":true,"staff":true,"user_id":5,"hidden":false,"hidden_reason_id":null,"trust_level":4,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":false,"wiki":false},{"id":25444,"name":"","username":"TheSlowGrowth","avatar_template":"/letter_avatar_proxy/v2/letter/t/90db22/{size}.png","created_at":"2017-12-14T15:28:12.560Z","cooked":"\u003caside class=\"quote\" data-post=\"13\" data-topic=\"4013\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"title\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"quote-controls\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" src=\"//community.axoloti.com/user_avatar/community.axoloti.com/thetechnobear/40/6_1.png\" class=\"avatar\"\u003ethetechnobear:\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eexplain how you derived your equation\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA few posts back I wrote the equation and also posted an image of the circuit I used to model this.\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see, I assumed the operational amplifiers as \"perfect amplifiers\", so they appear only as abstract amplification blocks, except for the second amplifier, which has a finite input impedance of 47k, which i modeled with resistor Ri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow we need the basic equations of each components.\u003cbr\u003eFor the resistor, the current/voltage relationship is defined by Ohm's law: \u003ccode\u003eR = Ur/Ir\u003c/code\u003e. For the 1k resistor: \u003ccode\u003eUr=10*Uin - Ud\u003c/code\u003e (\u003ccode\u003eUd\u003c/code\u003e is the voltage at the node connecting the diode and the resistor relative to ground.) So that gives: \u003ccode\u003eIr = (10*Uin - Ud)/R\u003c/code\u003e. For the 47k resistor that models the imput impedance of the following amplifier stage: \u003ccode\u003eUr = Ud\u003c/code\u003e, so that gives: \u003ccode\u003eIri = Ud/Ri\u003c/code\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the Diode, the relationship is \u003ccode\u003eId = I0 * (exp(A*Ud) - 1)\u003c/code\u003e, where \u003ccode\u003eA\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eI0\u003c/code\u003e are constants that I read from the datasheet.

directly see from the form of the equation - it is implicit! To deal with these equations, he suggests to use the Newton Raphson algorithm. I knew about this and the numerical solver in python probably uses this algorithm or something similar. But hadn't thought about using it in real time, because it is very CPU hungry and depending on your exit condition for the algorithm, it can also take different number of iterations to get to a desired result, or not get any result at all - which is something very undesireable in a DSP environment. \u003cbr\u003eOne interesting note here is that he suggests to use lookup tables to do the first iterations of the Newton Raphson algorithm, speeding things up immensly. This is something I hadn't yet though of. You don't even need a lot of precision in these tables and you could probably get along just fine with uninterpolated tables - if you use them for the first few iterations of the algorithm, that will get you close to the solution of the implicit equation. You can then refine the result further by doing the last few iterations with the real, CPU hungry equation.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":19,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-12-15T09:26:38.857Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"avg_time":16,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":73,"score":15.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":4013,"topic_slug":"modelling-analog-circuits-in-software","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"primary_group_flair_url":null,"primary_group_flair_bg_color":null,"primary_group_flair_color":null,"version":3,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIChUOV_0w4","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"YouTube","clicks":20}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1129,"hidden":false,"hidden_reason_id":null,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":false,"wiki":false},{"id":25468,"name":"Filippo Tamagnini","username":"Sputnki","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/community.axoloti.com/sputnki/{size}/175_1.png","created_at":"2017-12-15T11:58:45.341Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eOk, maybe taylor approximation is not the correct solution.
