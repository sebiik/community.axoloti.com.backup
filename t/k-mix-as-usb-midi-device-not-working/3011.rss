    <title>K-Mix as USB midi device, not working</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/k-mix-as-usb-midi-device-not-working/3011</link>
    <description>Below is what I get when connect the KMI K-Mix.
I imagine it is problematic because there are 3 ports - the instruction manual it states that port three is the port for sending MIDI values.

<p>I have a Raspberry Pi but it's currently lacking an OS.</p>

<p>On my Macs and iPad it just shows the three MIDI devices.  </p>

<p>The switch to midi mode is a hardware thing - changing the controllers from controlling the onboard DSP to sending MIDI from one of three banks.  I've seen the ports listed on Mac and OSX without having to change to the MIDI banks.</p>

<p>Interesting the midi ports don't show up in MIDI studio even though the Audio does.  (Yes i've rescanned)</p>

<p>I gave some more info on <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/akai-midimix-not-working-when-usb-hosted/387">this thread</a> for others, but honestly its difficult to get the detailed information that I need... I need to see the full details, for all interfaces/endpoints, and particular the class and subclass.<br>(as you can see from the other thread, this is just not usually included) <br>up till Ive not found a program which gives the full information, a surprise, as its not that hard to write a program that does it.(but I dont have time to do this at the moment) </p>

<p>even so, unfortunately the axoloti logs do appear to be pretty clear, that its not supporting midi streaming.<br>the reason you get MID class failed to init, is it tries each of the interface looking for class=0x1 subclass=0x3 which is midi... it doesn't find it so it fails.</p>

<p>please bare in mind, we have lots of class compliant devices that work perfectly, so we know we are searching for the correct thing, this includes a number of other KMI devices (e.g. softstep)</p>

<p>given its a modern device I assumed it would support class compliant  which is why I asked if it had to be activated some how... </p>

<p>the only thing I can think of is we only scan the interfaces when the device is connected, so if you have to activate midi AFTER its connected, it may be, we don't see the new midi interface... though this is not something ive seen before.<br>... this is something that you may be able to see on a computer.</p>

<p>of course, without a k-mix to connect, I cant really do any debugging/troubleshooting...</p>

<blockquote><p>so according to this, the k-mix does not have a usb class compliant midi interface.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>It certainly advertises that it is.  It works with an iPad Air. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://files.keithmcmillen.com/products/k-mix/documentation/kmix-manual.pdf" rel="nofollow">manual</a> is quite detailed - section 4.3 focuses on MIDI.<br>Within this section it states...</p>

<blockquote><p>"4.3.1.3 – PORT 3: K-MIX CONTROL SURFACE<br>The K-Mix Control Surface port is used for receiving MIDI from and sending MIDI to K-Mix’s MIDI banks. This is the port that audio applications should listen to in order to receive MIDI coming directly from K-Mix."</p></blockquote>

<p>Port 2 is for the external MIDI expander if it is connected and Port 1 is for the Mackie Control type setup.</p>

<p>When using Lemur on the iPad the three separate ports show up as three devices.<br>I've noticed they show up in different orders on the iPad compared to the Mac.<br>The correct port needs to be selected to enable MIDI control - not sure who that is done on the AXO</p>

<p><aside class="quote"><blockquote><p>what we would really need to see , is a full USB device tree from a computer that does not have any K-Mix driver/software </p></blockquote></aside></p>

<p>K-Mix doesn't have a driver on OSX - only an editor.<br>How can I generate a USB device tree?  </p>

<p>Certainly think this "should" work.</p>

<p>so according to this, the k-mix does not have a usb class compliant midi interface.</p>

<p>however,  perhaps there is something you need to do on it to 'activate' the midi interface.</p>

<p>what we would really need to see , is a full USB device tree from a computer that does not have any K-Mix driver/software loaded on it. (since this might 'activate' usb mode in the driver, like the Virus TI does)</p>
