              <p>By any chance, do you know if that fixes the 9v- centered "risk" of current taking wrong path, as described about the v1 board in this old topic  ? <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/power-supply-for-stand-alone-use/344/14?u=nicotep">http://community.axoloti.com/t/power-supply-for-stand-alone-use/344/14?u=nicotep</a></p>

I don't mean to whine, but the ramp up to use this device is significantly daunting for it. <br>I went through the schematic and I couldn't answer my question, I mean, there's not even a pic of the board explaining what ALL the available in/outs do... in fact one of the diagrams that comes up is wrong and is left up (albeit followed by a corrected version)...<br> I guess what I'm saying is, I'm spending a lot of time combing this forum for very basic, RTFM type questions, and getting partial info I'm not sure is current and its making it hard to love this device.</p>

<p>there are no major changes to 1.2 (afaik) only minor changes related to power protection (see posts on early issues), but I'm pretty sure these won't make any difference to end users.</p>

<p>perhaps <a class="mention" href="/u/johannes">@Johannes</a> you could add a copy of the revised 1.2 schematics to the above page.</p>

<p>i don't see any of your posts being unanswered, which posts are you referring too? what open questions do you have?</p>

<p>I'm not really into the hardware side myself, so probably cant help much,  but, there are a lot of people here that are very helpful with lots of experience, and have done a amazing number of different things with axoloti.<br>so id recommend asking questions here, perhaps someone can help you.</p>
