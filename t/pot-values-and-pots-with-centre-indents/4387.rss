    <title>Pot values, and pots with centre indents?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/pot-values-and-pots-with-centre-indents/4387</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

I&#39;ve just found a few 20k pots with centre indents in my parts drawer and have a few Q&#39;s. First, the recommendation is 470ohm-10k pots - what happens when higher k pots are used?

Annnd with the centre-indent pots, would these work reliably to return something like a +/- value k inlet on a patch to zero? For example, the same place you would place a ctrl/dial b. I&#39;d love to use these to give +/- envelope depth on a synth patch.

Thoughts?</description>

              <p>With higher pots, you will have more noise on the inputs. Thus you may consider shielding.<br>You can convert a unipolar to a bipolar value with the dedicated object in library/convert. I don't know how well centred are your pots, thus I can't tell if the center will really be zero.</p>
