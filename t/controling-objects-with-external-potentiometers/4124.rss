    <title>Controling objects with external potentiometers</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/controling-objects-with-external-potentiometers/4124</link>
    <description>I feel silly asking this question, but here goes: I patched a synth and want to control the main parameters using potentiometers. I got the potentiometers connected and into the patch, but I can&#39;t get them to do what the controls on the objects do.
Example: I use an ADSR envelope with modulation inputs. I can connect a potentiometer via gpio/in/analog and use it to modulate, say, attack, but only _relative to the position of the (virtual) dial on the object_. That is, I cannot access the full -64 to +64 via the gpio, but only change the attack time a little bit relative to whatever the dial is set to in the patcher.
What I want is to have the full range of attack time values for the parameter available from my potentiometer; analogously for various other dials, say filter frequency etc. There is a way to do that, isn&#39;t there?

Thanks in advance,
Daniel</description>

              <p>The  gpio/in/analog object has a unipolar output, it outputs values in a range from 0 to 64, and you are trying to control a bipolar parameter (with a range from -64 to 64), if you want to control the full range you have 2 options, one is multiply the potentiometer out by 2 (using a math object) and set the control of the ADSR to -64. The other is left the control of the ADSR at 0 and convert the out of the potentiometer to a bipolar value (using the polar to bipolar object).</p>
