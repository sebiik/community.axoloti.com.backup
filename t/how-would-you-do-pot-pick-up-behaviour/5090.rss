    <title>How would you do pot pick-up behaviour?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/how-would-you-do-pot-pick-up-behaviour/5090</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using one pot (a knob on a midi controller) to control several different parameters and using the page (/template) function on my midi controller (a launchControl) to select which parameter the pot will control. 

What this means is that I get discontinuous jumps of the parameters when I change between pages. My midi controller doesn&#39;t have a &quot;pick-up&quot; function, where the pot would have to move through the current value of the parameter to pick it up and start changing it. So I wanted to patch that behaviour in the Axoloti. 

I&#39;ve come up with this, which works but looks clunky. I&#39;ve created a delay in the k-rate value using a +1 and -1 object stacked above each other. I tried using the k-rate delay object but its minimum delay of &quot;32&quot; was too long and meant the parameter value would get held and left behind if I twisted the knob too fast. 

Is there a better way of doing this?

(The disconnect pot toggle button is there to simulate changing pages on the controller)

<blockquote><p>Try this one out. I have made a test version for the 6 knobs. You use the first button on the right to choose between layer 1 &amp; 2. It is pretty sijple to add the last stuff from here. Or else you can also check Tom Whitwells patch on Github. It shows how to set up everything. You need to use <span class="mention">@hellcores</span> hookmod object for this patch to work.  There are 2 versions. One that uses the cv from the gpio directly and one that converts the gpios to midi cc. Layer 1 is midi cc 1-6 and layer 2 is midi ccâ€¦</p></blockquote></aside>
