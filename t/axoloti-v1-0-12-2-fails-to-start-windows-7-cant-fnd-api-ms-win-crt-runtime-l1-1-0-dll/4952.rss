    <title>Axoloti v1.0.12-2 fails to start Windows 7 can&#39;t fnd api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll</title>

    <description>New User here. Just received my Axoloti today.

64 bit Windows 7 machine, installed the hardware without issue. Apparently installed patcher 1.0.12-2 also without issue. Ran Axoloti.exe and immediately received an error dialog box stating that &quot;api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll is missing. Try reinstalling the application&quot;.

Upon inspecting the  C:\Program Files (x86) folder, the install looks good. and the api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll appears in the C:\Program Files (x86)\Axoloti\runtime\bin folder. Tried rebooting the machine, resinstalling, starting Axoloti with and without hardware running, ran as administroator... no avail. Any ideas?

I installed v1.0.12 and it works. So that suggests there&#39;s something in the the v.0.12-2 versions that&#39;s borked for a Windows 7 X64 installation. I guess since 1.0.12 is running, I&#39;m not dead in the water, but sure like to be running the latest S/W.</description>
