    <title>1st time Unix user, I can&#39;t install AXO Gui, Help Please!</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/1st-time-unix-user-i-cant-install-axo-gui-help-please/2125</link>
    <description>As I have mentioned in another post, I have installed Mint Linux, I am a first timer at this after many years under windows, It all installed fine on my prehistoric laptop which I want to dedicate to the Axo.
:dizzy_face: However now with my tail between my legs I have no idea how to install Axo Gui.
As per the below instructions, I spent all night searching for associations that we help me recognize what I need to do. The only thing I think I can figure out is the instructions refer to Terminal controls.

As this is a seriously noob position to be in, I apologize to anyone that this post may offend. :sob:
For anyone who can assist, I will greatly appreciate it. !!! :astonished:


2.install axoloti runtime
◦unpack axo_runtime.*.tgz into user home directory e.g. cd ~ ; tar zxvf axoloti_runtime.tgz
◦you will now have a folder ~/axoloti_runtime/platform_linux 


3.install application 
◦install debian package, using sudo dpkg -i axoloti_1.0.deb
◦this will install into /opt
◦Axoloti app will be on your application menu (may be different on different distros)


4.install dependent packages 
◦using : sudo apt-get install -y lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 lib32bz2-1.0


5.grant permissions for your user to use the USB device
◦make sure the axoloti board is not connected
◦run ~/axoloti_runtime/platform_linux/add_udev_rules.sh</description>

              <p>Ah. I didn't notice the 32bit in your post. Yes, x86 (32bit) isn't quite straightforward on linux but it's not really difficult. Come back when you're ready and we'll have another go.</p>

              <p>Thanks <span class="mention">@mongrel</span>,<br>I was working on it last night with no success, then later through other posts found comments regarding the GUI not easily installing on 32 bit systems. I did see where someone had listed the process for installing on 32bit, but for now, that is a bit beyond my Unix related skills, so will leave for a later challenge. Thanks again.</p>

              <p>The terminal commands are typed into a "Terminal". Look in Accessories menu or I think Mint has a terminal app on the panel (little black square icon). This is just like cmd on Windows.</p>

<p>The GUI is the "axoloti_1.0.deb" file. This is like a WIndows Installer. Open up terminal and do just as it says.</p>

<p><code>sudo dpkg -i axoloti_1.0.deb</code></p>

<p>and it'll appear in your Application Menu somewhere</p>
