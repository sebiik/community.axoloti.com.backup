    <title>Drone Engine powered by Axoloti</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/drone-engine-powered-by-axoloti/7686</link>
    <description>I had this Axoloti core for a couple of years and never gave good use to it, until now :slight_smile:
I&#39;ve assembled a patch with two Mutable Instruments Braids oscilators and a third generic oscillator, going into a mixer, a delay and a reverb.
I also have some potentiometers modules and multiplexers from past projects, connected to a Teensy LC sending MIDI to the Axo.
The pitch potentiometers should be connected to a analog inputs, instead of midi, to have full resolution  

I would like to thank everyone who contributes to this community, because without this forum I wouldn&#39;t be able to make this. 
I will leave the patch here if anyone wants to play with it.</description>
