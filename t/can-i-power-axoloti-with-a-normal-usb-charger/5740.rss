    <title>Can I power Axoloti with a normal USB charger?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/can-i-power-axoloti-with-a-normal-usb-charger/5740</link>
    <description>Hi.

I got my axoloti core a few weeks ago and have finally come to the stage where I&#39;d like to put it in an enclosure and use it live. My issue is I don&#39;t want a 16cm wide enclosure to fit the entire axoloti circuit, but rather remove the MIDI part of the board. That also means removing the DC input. Can I simply use a USB charger to power the circuit, like a micro USB phone charger, or do I need to power it in some other way? If I need to power it by adding a new DC input, how do I connect it physically and do I need to program it in the software? 

I&#39;m very new to both the hardware and software world, so please dumb it down as much as possible if you&#39;ve got an answer for me, haha! 

Thank you! I&#39;ve learned a lot already when I was making my patches, so big props to all the kind and knowledgeable people here!</description>

              <p>Thank you <a class="mention" href="/u/lokki">@lokki</a> for the quick and helpful reply! I will try to just load the patch into the axoloti, unplug it from the computer and test a few USB chargers to see if they're too noisy. I'm making a lo-fi dual tape deck simulator, so a little noise is OK.</p>

              <p>you can power it with a usb-charger. i do that all the time and as you i removed the midi part from my axoloti to put it in a 1590BB enclosure (i reattached it to the board via wires and managed to put it into the enclosure as well at a 90 degree angle, see here:</p>

<p>the only issue you could encounter is if you use a noisy usb-charger. best to try one and see if it is an issue <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
