    <title>Who to contact for order support?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/who-to-contact-for-order-support/4682</link>
    <description>I made a mistake typing in my email when i ordered.
(im baffled as to how but autocomplete had my email address saved wrong)

Who can i contact about making sure the order goes through properly?
I sent an email to Taelman (i paid paypal so his email address was listed there) but not sure if theres someone better to reach.

also slightly concerned about the address as when i submitted i saw that its listed as Street name followed by house number which is the opposite of how addresses are done in the US at least. not sure if that&#39;s a big deal.

edit: issue resolved.</description>
