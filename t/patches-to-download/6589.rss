    <title>Patches to download</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/patches-to-download/6589</link>
    <description>Hi everyone, I&#39;ve just got my axoloti out again, after putting it on the back burner for 18 months or so. I assumed, that in the time it had been gathering dust, there would be many many more patches available to download....but I&#39;m struggling to find any. Am I missing something? I have a github account, and a couple of years back I dl&#39;d around 25 folders, all containing lots of cool patches. But when I search for new ones, all I can find is those same 25 folders. Can someone help? Point me to the best place please? Thanks in advance, Paul</description>

              <p>Do you mean other than what's in the community library? (File&gt;Library&gt;Community and Help&gt;Library&gt;Community)</p>

<p>If you trawl the forum you will find a few patches, I guess you could do a search for .axp and just go through the search results there's quite a few to find...thing is because everyone's need/use case is so divergent, patches that are not found in the community library may have to be edited to your own particular use...and people tend to stumble on an interesting module and build up from there ......what sort of patches were you hoping for?</p>
