    <title>Fw 1.0.11 crashes the board after loading same patch couple of times</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/fw-1-0-11-crashes-the-board-after-loading-same-patch-couple-of-times/2285</link>
    <description>I have some problems after installing 1.0.11. I reformatted the SD-card as advised.
When I upload a tutorial library patch (ticking the live button) it usually goes wel the first time(s). But when I load the same patch a 2nd or 3d time, i get &quot;control transfer failed&quot; error, the board freezes, and I have to un/replug power to get things going again. Windows 7 machine. Anyone experience this behavior or have any suggestions?</description>

              <p>I did what you suggested. I loaded (with load I mean click "live") tutorial patch 26_simple_sequencer. Worked. Unloaded, Loaded again 5 times. Worked.<br>Loaded 01_sine_oscillator. Same thing. Load and unload 5 times. No problem.<br>Then the third patch 11_subtractive_simple. First time I load I get an error in the patcher. It contains the lines:<br><em>Control transfer failed: -9</em><br><em>block uploaded @ 0x20011000 length 13836</em><br><em>Disconnect request</em><br><em>Done uploading patch</em> <br>The patcher disconnects. I cannot connect. It doesnt respond to mouse clicks. After a minute it gives much red text containg lines like "java.security.ProtectionDomain..." and "at java.awt.EventQueue...". <br>The axoloti board does nothing, doesn't react on midi keyboard. Green light steady.<br>I try close the patcher software, but Windows won't let me. I close via Taskmanager.<br>I start patcher again. It gives error "control transfer failed: -7" and again all kinds of java errors (see attachment).<br>Only when i unplug and replug the Axoloti everything is back to normal.<br>I tried other tutorial patches. They all worked, only 11_subtractive_simple leads to errors and crashes.<br>Maybe it's just that patch? I'll try with other patches and report back.<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/a59a47e22fec8ec99c0a007e2b42322957b6280b" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a59a47e22fec8ec99c0a007e2b42322957b6280b.jpg" class="lightbox" title="Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/a/a59a47e22fec8ec99c0a007e2b42322957b6280b_1_619x500.jpg" width="619" height="500"><div class="meta">

              <p>Im wondering if this might be related to <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/problem-with-1-0-11-and-uploading-on-sd-card/2189">this</a> ... if so, then <a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> has a possible fix, will be in 1.0.12.</p>

<p>(Ive not seen this myself, on macOS, with 1.0.11, but could be a W7 thing, as above post was also W7)</p>

<p>When you say the board freezes, do you really mean the board or the Axoloti UI?<br>try running a sine oscillator directly into audio out, and then uploading a few time (to cause the failure) then when it fails .. are you still hearing the sine oscillator?<br>(if you can hear it, then its the connection between board and UI. if you can't then the patch has crashed on the board)</p>
