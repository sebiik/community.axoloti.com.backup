    <title>Semi-modular hardware patch bay?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/semi-modular-hardware-patch-bay/3962</link>
    <description>Is it possible to wire up a semi-modular patch bay like many of Bastl Instruments&#39; synths have?
https://my.mixtape.moe/fsxjix.png
Is this something that the GPIO ports can do, or would extra components be required? There&#39;s just something really fun about plugging stuff together physically rather than turning knobs on a controller.</description>

              <p>Thanks TB, think you may be right about the resistance division, that's why I was thinking if you used trim pots instead, you know the tiny little potentiometers that get soldered directly to pcb's.<br>They can be adjusted but not recommended to be adjusted as much as the standard pots we use in our builds. If you used these for each output, you won't need a pile of resistors too build you analogue division, additionally the trim pots can be adjusted for each output as required, and it would make adding more later much easier.<br>There was never any intention to use analogue output, shouldn't be needed.

              <p>I have considered this idea before, actually inspired by the MS20-ic</p>

<p>in my idea, this was solely for patching 'on the fly' within axoloti .. I'll come back to this later, as I'm not sure if this is your goal or not (as bastls approach allows for other devices to get involved)</p>

<p>my approach:<br>i considered this actually as mainly a software problem (perhaps because I'm a software guy <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> ) , basically the GPIO , would just connect digital OUT to digital IN(s) , and then each digital out woud send a unique digital signature , such that the input would know to which output it was connected.<br>for patching, I was then just going to create an input and output objects, a bit like the send and receive objects... but which would be gated/routed according to the current physical connections.</p>

<p>your approach is different...  (my understanding could be incorrect, so bare with me <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> ) <br>I guess you must still be using digital outs... as there are only 2 analog outs.<br>in which case, you still end up with a essentially a switch... but your using the voltage as a signature.<br>... one question, won't the voltage change, if you have 2 outputs connected to 2 different inputs?<br>as the 3.3v will now be divided thru two different paths?<br>(i.e. OUT 5 -&gt; IN 5 = X volts, but when you in addition connect OUT1 -&gt; IN1 , is the O5I5 still X?)<br>I guess this could be avoided if you essentially scan the outputs, or perhaps you can just calculate this, as its still a constant... perhaps you covered this above, but I just missed it.</p>

<p>internal midi, yeah nice if you want to have easy, CC mapping, but it does limit you to 7 bit, and its also not at audio rate. (which I think was the point you were making about s-rate link) </p>

<p>'on the fly within axoloti'  ... so another approach its to go the whole 'cv' approach, and just make it a 3.3v voltage... this would allow other devices (or even multiple axoloti) to join in the fun... as the signal is not just a routing switch, but a real signal (this is what bastl do)<br>Ive actually made up some boards which allow, this but using 5v, so I can interface to an AE modular, and other BASTL stuff which is 5v, which was the primary advantage of this approach as i saw it.</p>

<p>the main issue here, is Axoloti only having 2 analog outputs... and there are not at audio either.. but perhaps buying a cheap DAC for output would be a solution... not sure if there is one with many outputs.... something like 8 would be ideal for me <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  (hmm, I guess bastl must do similar, or perhaps I can just use an teensy/ arduino or something)</p>

<p>yeah I think I did once come across a midi controller like this... cant remember what it was called... not sure if it was called a patch bay, or a matrix... which is basically the same thing.</p>

<p>So who makes midi controllers that look like patch bays ?.. I don't know, my knowledge of synths is very limited, only what I have learnt on this forum.. <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>

<p>I guess you could make it yourself. Just like any other diy midi controller with different hardware. By applying the analogue read concept in this post, should be pretty straight forward.</p>

<p>Why am I so fascinated with this idea... because it replaces the need for a display of sorts to know what's connected etc.. all the cable will tell you what is connected to what.<br><img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/sunglasses.png?v=5" title=":sunglasses:" class="emoji" alt=":sunglasses:"></p>

    Hi everyone, this example should show, how a MCP3208 can be used to read eight analog sources. The MCP3208 is connected to axoloti SPI port. This ADC method is much faster then the 4051 method and the MCP3208 has an input protection. Each ADC channel has a 12bit resolution and is compared to the VREF voltage. VREF should be in a range of 0,25V to VDD and decoupled/stabilized by a 100nF capacitor and min. 10uF polarized capacitor (not shown in the wiring picture). If you want to use more then one…

              <p>I don't think it would make much of a difference, I tried this setup n the Axo once before, the resistor ladder was connected to switches. I tried it because I was hoping it might filter out a spike that happened when the button was pressed, a falling edge trigger instead of the rising edge, but didn't work, but the spike never exceeded 3.3v on the analogue pin. To solve it, I had to apply a delay that would wait for the spike to disappear before reading the pin. I don't think it would be an issue if using patch cables.</p>

              <p>I got to thinking that their might actually be quite a simple solution that does not take up too much resources, and a patch bay type scenario is just one of many that could easily be adapted. I am not Synth guy, so please bare with me.<br>The way I see it, just like in an object, we want to go from somewhere to somewhere, in this setup, you could go A to B, A to B to C, but not B to A, C to A or C to B.<br>In this example, lets focus on A to B.</p>

<p>In the Axo patch, <br>- B is a monopole dial connected to a midi CC value.<br>- A is a Midi Internal send object where the CC value is connected a value read from an analogue input pin.</p>

<p>In the hardware,<br>- Build an output port for B with Resistor / 3.3V / GND setup to create a unique analogue value sent out of port B, single wire only required.<br>- Build an input port for A connected to an analogue pin so the unique analogue value read will set the CC value on the midi internal send object to the same CC value set on the monopole dial that you want the values to go to.</p>

<p>The above describes a simple approach that could easily be expanded in a patch without too much impact on resources, not only that, it should work fine in live mode, might be a bit twitchy when connecting depending on the plugs you use, but I think what I like about it is, it could easily be extended to other styles without patch cords etc.. and it could easily be implemented between several Axo boards as well.</p>

<p>I am sure that are many ways the idea could be fine tuned, but there it is.<br>I hope I have explained it well enough to get the idea across.<br><img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/grin.png?v=5" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>

              <p>Dear Smasho,</p>

<p>This confuses me.</p>

<p>What I understood until now is that switching to live mode means that one sends the software to the Axoloti but that all th eknobs in the main screen can then still be controlled by either screen input , amnalog input or MIDI input. Of MIDI I am sure and Mathew Tyass's video tutorial seems to indicate that anlog input is also possible.</p>

<p>What you write however seems to imply is that one cannot tweak the software on the screen in the Live mode and at the same time do the same for assigned parameters via the analog and digital inputs on the card!</p>

<p>If that is right it would be a major bummer because that would automatically card-input-wise, lead to an OR situation in stead of an EITHER / OR situation, basically only leaving the possibility of combining the Live mode with a MIDI controller.</p>

<p>Is that right?</p>

<p>The rest what you say is basically what I already tried to describe. Axoloti wil not use the actual analog signals but interpret them by measuring them and convert them to the right binary code.</p>

<p>The in/output sheet seems to indicate only the PAS and PA4 board connections can be used as analog outs, thus at best leading to a bit of a lobsided situation of 13 analog inputs against only 2 outputs. Making the use of a hardware patchfield for the Axoloti itself rather unpractical indeed. </p>

<p>Well let's say it would indeed be rather akward to do external patching since everything can already be done wihtin the software. Which sort of brings me back to the conclusion that one can better use the analog inputs for other things.</p>

<p>But if one insists patching could still play a part, for instance by patching signals from an external modular system into the Axoloti, assuming the right voltages are fed in of course.</p>

              <p>With all the restrictions you have read already. still you can do a little bit..  For instance, in your "modular patch" having lfo's gates and triggers as outputs and having some inputs like additional filter modulation, extra note trigger, advance step in a sequencer, modulate pitch, modulate FM, etc.. Though, of course, most work it's done in Soft.  Also, you should protect the inputs (and maybe outputs too )by adding some resistors, just in case..</p>

<p>In a few words:<br>With the graphical interface, on the PC or Mac, you connect modules, then the patch is compiled, all the connexions and modules are transformed into code with optimisations. This assembly code is uploaded to the Axoloti. <br>In the Axoloti, a "patch" is an actual program.</p>

<hr>

<p>A software solution is to use multiplexers in the patch that could be changed live, much like routing switches found in the Arp Odyssey,</p>

<hr>

<p>It is not necessary to have actual signals flowing in your hardware connections, what is essential is to detect the hardware connections in order to replicate them in software.</p>

<p>We can imagine a hardware <strong>interface</strong> that consist of connectors and wires. <br>With some scanning method it will be possible to detect what is connected to what.<br>The list of connections can control the software multiplexers in order to get the patch work conform to the hardware connections.</p>

<p>But well, i think that doing something similar to the Arp Odyssey routing switch can be a good start (not too complicated and can be a nice "proof of concept").</p>

<p>The routing switches are below the sliders, they allow to change the source corresponding to the slider, on the odyssey those are two position switches (the concept can be extended to more positions).</p>

              <p>It should be possible but you have to be aware that the number of in's and outs on the card is restricted. So you'd be quickly using up connections that you might also want to use for pots and such. The only solution to avoid those getting in the way would then be to edit everyhting else via the screen or use a MIDI controller feeding CC info into the program.</p>

<p>Another complication might be that you need to harmonize the signals. The Axoloti does after all not create voltages as such but produces these on the basis of calculated data (I suppose by putting the necesarry numbers into a DAC (Digital to Analog Convertor). Then these signals would have to be matched in a way that fits the typical Axoloti voltages. "All I/O is 3.3 V signaling" the website description of the core for instance states.</p>

<p>So I agree that it should be possible but do not expect straight out of the box interfacing with analog hardware. Furhtermore Axoloti only seems to have more then enough of everything when one is working with low processor power eating software objects. Everything else is often still doable but seldomly boundless.</p>

<p>To find out how to make it do things even the developers might not yet have thought about is howeverr part of the atraction.</p>

              <p>I guess it would be possible, but you would need to ensure there is some protection on your pins, general rule of thumb is to not connect and disconnect connections from your GPIO's in order to avoid damaging them. And you would need to setup your patch with all possibilities so the connection can be read. You could probably set it up as though making the connection is switching it on, and maybe set it up in reverse, where the pin is always high until the connection is made sending it low, and switching on the action.<br><img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/thinking.png?v=5" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:"></p>

              <p>Is it possible to wire up a semi-modular patch bay like many of Bastl Instruments' synths have?<br>          <a href="https://my.mixtape.moe/fsxjix.png" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">

<br>Is this something that the GPIO ports can do, or would extra components be required? There's just something really fun about plugging stuff together physically rather than turning knobs on a controller.</p>
