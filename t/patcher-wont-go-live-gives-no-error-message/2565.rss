    <title>Patcher won&#39;t go live gives no error message</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/patcher-wont-go-live-gives-no-error-message/2565</link>
    <description>i am having an issue where the patcher won&#39;t go live.

it has been working fine until last night.

the board is definitely still working as i has a patch in flash which runs if its powered up without USB

the console read out is 

when i connect to the board:

        USB device found
        connected
        Authentic Axoloti Core
        Firmware version: 1.0.0.1, crc=0x50A29AA2, entrypoint=0x20011000

when i try to go live:

        Generate code complete
        Disconnect request

i have checked with some of the library tutorial files and am getting the exact same issue.

running 1.0.11 on a 2009 Macbook pro with mac os 10.11.3.</description>

              <p>Hmm odd, I cannot see an obvious issue, and your saying nothing has changed. - little to go on really.  </p>

<p>Try holding down s2 ( I think?) when powering up, this should prevent flash patch from loading. <br>Perhaps that patch is somehow the source of the issue. <br>Also try a DFU flash, I had an issue recently where this was required. ( not this one though)</p>

<p>Also try taking a minimal patch live , e.g. with no audio- see what if there is some object that causes the issue.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately , I cannot see another way than trying different things</p>

<p>My gut feeling is it's an issue with the USB connection / cable but if you have ruled that out then we need to try other things</p>

<p>only the last two lines are generated by trying to take the patch live.</p>

<p>i am using 1.0.11 and this was working fine for some time before this issue presented its self.</p>

<p>i have never used an sd card in this axolotl or with this patch.<br>i have tried with three different usb cables one of which has worked for me in the past.<br>don't have a usb hub to hand also haven't ever used one with this axoloti.<br>had already refreshed the firmware but not a DFU refresh.<br>trashing prefs hasn't fixed it.<br>also no luck with the reset libraries.</p>

<p>it last worked sunday night and i have been away from it since.<br>i had uploaded the patch to flash but had been able to go live several times after doing so.<br>when i connect to the board it shows as "running flash patch" and the patch that has been loaded from flash works fine.</p>

              <p>hmm, nothing you've posted looks incorrect.... </p>

<p>are there any other messages in the console?, might be an idea to get the entire console and paste it into  pastebin.com.</p>

<p>so we need to go slowly step by step<br>can you use the following for testing (and only this... so we know what we are working with) <br>library-&gt;factory-&gt;demos-&gt;youtube-&gt;tybett </p>

<p>if this patch works... then report this, but then find another demo that doesn't work, and let me know which.</p>

<p>I assume you are using 1.0.11 from github, and that you have the latest 'runtime'</p>

<p>now some variables, try one at a time<br>- try without SD Card<br>- use axo directly with usb hub, try different usb cables<br>- re-flash the firmware (on board menu)<br>- delete (move) your axoloti.prefs, so a fresh one is installed.<br>- do 'reset libraries' in preferences</p>

<p>(I know, boring stuff, that you 'know' is ok, but with little information, all we can is 'go back to basics')</p>

<p>also, its useful to know...<br>when was it last working? and what have you changed since then?...<br>(i.e. did you upgrade to 1.0.11, has it ever worked since then? ... did you do a sync libraries? etc)</p>
