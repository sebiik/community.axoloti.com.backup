    <title>Reading from SD Card fails 50% of the time</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/reading-from-sd-card-fails-50-of-the-time/6723</link>
    <description>Hey, I could not find any related thread.

With a patch that loads multiple audio-files, an error is thrown sometimes about being unable to load a file.
When I disconnect the power and try again, it will sometimes work again, sometimes not.
Inserting the card to my PC, all is fine, except running fsck will detect that the &quot;dirty&quot; bit of the file system is set.

At first I thought it is due to my code but I cannot see anything wrong with it. I think I have this issue with both of my Axolotis. Is anybody else experiencing this?

Example error:

&gt; file error: FR_DISK_ERR, filename:&quot;/sfx/sfx-045.raw&quot;

fsck:
&gt; 0x41: Dirty bit is set. Fs was not properly unmounted and some data may be corrupt.
&gt; 1) Remove dirty bit
&gt; 2) No action

I think I will try re-formatting it from within the patcher app now.

It&#39;s a common 16GB Transcend card</description>

<p>Seems like I missed your post, asking for reference for SD-card. Im sorry bout that. But seems like you are up and running now <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>I think you might be right. Did some more testing, with two different cards and two Axolotis.<br>I did see the issue with the second card first, but after re-formatting it did not happen for a long time so I am a little more optimistic now. The working card is also from Transcend but it's a 32GB one.</p>

<p>When comparing the benchmark tests of the two cards, the problematic one has <code>read BW 1900 kB/s</code> whereas the more stable one has <code>read BW 2361 kB/s</code>. Does low-speed cause read-fails?<br>I was sceptical before, since it's just about about loading just a few megabytes.</p>

We have had a couple of post recently about using SD card, and their performance. I thought it might be interesting to have a topic where can collect users experiences about different cards and their performance. 

please post in this topic information about the cards you are using and their performance:

<p>Keep in mind SD-Cards has different performance. The first 2 I had was not good for Axo. Third one I got was good.</p>

<p>There is a thread in the forum about sd-card and benchmark test.  You could try doing the same test and compare it to the tests in the benchmark thread and see what you have.</p>

<p>Use the wave/sdbenchmark object for the test.</p>
