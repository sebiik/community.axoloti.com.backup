<p>At first I thought it is due to my code but I cannot see anything wrong with it. I think I have this issue with both of my Axolotis. Is anybody else experiencing this?</p>

<p>Example error:</p>

<blockquote><p>file error: FR_DISK_ERR, filename:"/sfx/sfx-045.raw"</p></blockquote>

<p>fsck:</p>

<blockquote><p>0x41: Dirty bit is set. Fs was not properly unmounted and some data may be corrupt.<br>1) Remove dirty bit<br>2) No action</p></blockquote>

<p>I think I will try re-formatting it from within the patcher app now.</p>

<p>It's a common 16GB Transcend card</p>

<p>That was what I was going to suggest <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>Keep in mind SD-Cards has different performance. The first 2 I had was not good for Axo. Third one I got was good.</p>

<p>There is a thread in the forum about sd-card and benchmark test.  You could try doing the same test and compare it to the tests in the benchmark thread and see what you have.</p>

<p>Use the wave/sdbenchmark object for the test.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately re-formatting did not make a difference.<br>Do you happen to know what brand/model the one is that worked well for you?<br>Thanks for the hint, I will do the benchmark now.<br>I was thinking maybe it's the pins on the card reader.<br>The benchmark does not report anything suspicious, it seems al-right.</p>

        <p>I think you might be right. Did some more testing, with two different cards and two Axolotis.<br>I did see the issue with the second card first, but after re-formatting it did not happen for a long time so I am a little more optimistic now. The working card is also from Transcend but it's a 32GB one.</p>

<p>When comparing the benchmark tests of the two cards, the problematic one has <code>read BW 1900 kB/s</code> whereas the more stable one has <code>read BW 2361 kB/s</code>. Does low-speed cause read-fails?<br>I was sceptical before, since it's just about about loading just a few megabytes.</p>

        <p>I received new cards that I ordered for testing, the brand is "goodram". <br>They make a big difference, so far they were 100% reliable, I made several tests where I re-loaded 6MB worth of samples 30 times and there were no <code>FR_DISK_ERR</code> errors at all.<br>It is a relief to know that the Axoloti is not at fault.</p>
