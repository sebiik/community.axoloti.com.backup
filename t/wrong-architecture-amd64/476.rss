    <description>When trying to install from the .deb i get &quot;Wrong architecture &#39;amd64&#39;&quot;

trying the build.sh gives:

E: Unable to locate package lib32z1
E: Unable to locate package lib32ncurses5
E: Unable to locate package lib32bz2-1.0
E: Couldn&#39;t find any package by regex &#39;lib32bz2-1.0&#39;

info about OS:

$ lsb_release -a
Distributor ID:    Ubuntu
Description:    Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS
Release:    14.04
Codename:    trusty

$ uname -m
i686

any idea?
thanks

EDIT:
I read &quot;i686 means that you&#39;re using 32 bit OS.&quot; now
Is it possible / hard to install on a 32-bit OS?</description>

<p>I think it is fine, it passes travis-ci <a href="https://travis-ci.org/axoloti/axoloti/">https://travis-ci.org/axoloti/axoloti/</a><br>Sourceforge is occasionally down, that may have been the cause.</p>

              <p>yeah i think your possibly right, that the lib32bz2 was an older way of doing it,<br>see <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/637113/unable-to-locate-package-lib32bz2-1-0">http://askubuntu.com/questions/637113/unable-to-locate-package-lib32bz2-1-0</a></p>

<p>the problem we have is simple, we need others to update the build.sh script and issue pull requests, (no one person can have install all flavours on linux) ,  but then they need to be very careful they don't break things for other distros.</p>

<p>fortunately we will see if someone breaks the ubuntu 64 bit install , since travis build this (but its still a pain if we have to fix it) , this is why it can be 'supported' </p>

<p>i don't think there is anyone here, that has the time/patience to keep reinstalling new distros to test it... this is the difference between a commercial setup (which will only support limited distros as well) which has people who's job it is (QAs) , and an open source project where no one is paid to do this.</p>

<p>no one will thank us for support 10 different distros, which are broken on every release, and they will also be very critical if we release a version, and then it doesn't work ... its a no win situation.</p>

<p>here is my recommendation ... everyone use Ubuntu 64 bit 14.04, its what is tested <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile"> <br>(hmm perhaps the build.sh, should warn this when run)</p>

<p>on the positive side, <a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> has checked in a pull request that someone made for arch-linux, this also makes it easier to support different flavours architectures, so if anyone wants to contribute changes thats most welcome.</p>

<p>sorry for the rant... anyway, upshot is if you have a better fix for the build.sh, please consider issuing a pull request.</p>

              <p>I think the script is outdated or wrong for debian. (probably also for Ubuntu). at least for me on Linux  3.16.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.16.7-ckt9-3~deb8u1 (2015-04-24) x86_64 GNU/Linux it didn't work.</p>

<p>instead of using <strong>lib32bz2-1.</strong>0 use <strong>libbz2-1.0:i386</strong> to install 32 libs on a 64 bit os.<br>Or <strong>libbz2-1.0</strong> if you are on 32 bit.</p>

<p>I changed build.sh to make it work. probably there also should be a check for a 32 or 64 bit linux OS to point to the correct packages.</p>

<p>Edit: lib32z1 is the correct package for 64 bit</p>

<p>case $OS in<br>            Ubuntu|Debian)<br>                echo " sudo apt-get install -y libtool libudev-dev automake autoconf ant curl \<br>lib32z1 libncurses5:i386 libbz2-1.0:i386"      <br>                sudo apt-get install -y libtool libudev-dev automake autoconf ant curl \ <br>lib32z1 libncurses5:i386 libbz2-1.0:i386<br>                ;;</p>

<p>Also the Chibios download and unzip didn't work. But i am not on my machine to tell you how i fixed it. (for now try manually putting the chibios zip in ${PLATFORM_ROOT}/src .</p>

<p>Try install the dependencies for 32 bit like:<br>sudo apt-get install -y libtool libudev-dev automake autoconf ant curl libz1 libncurses5 libbz2-1.0</p>

<p>Hope it works</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

              <p>I doubt its 'hard' , just a different set of packages.... some in fact you wont need, as we are using the 32bit libraries (which would be the norm on the 32bit OS)  (this s due to a dependancy we have which is 32bit only)</p>
