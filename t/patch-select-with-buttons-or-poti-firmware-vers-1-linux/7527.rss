    <title>Patch select with buttons or poti firmware vers 1 (linux)</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/patch-select-with-buttons-or-poti-firmware-vers-1-linux/7527</link>
    <description>hello, i can&#39;t find a complete example how to get this working. i want to use the axo as soundprocessor for my diy aluminum-uprightbass type of thing. i need to be able switch between 3-4 patches during the gig (ext arduino midicontroller or axo-buttons). no need for the patches to run at the same time because there is a reverb afterwards in the chain. could someone pls give me some hints for the basics? where to store the controller object+ dir-info? what to put in it (besides the actual audio objects) what must be in the masterpatch, what proper file extensions? i see that if i store patches on the sdcard it makes the dirs with the name of the patch and inside a file &quot;patch.bin&quot; im so far that i can load one patch with a button...but not the others. ...( the axoloti is phantastic,  love it definitely ....though a bit hidden in secrets )   yann</description>

              <p>i now have createt an object, i suppose for the controller object which has gpio digital in for 6 buttons, each connected to a patch/load object. must i save it as axp or axs? the field for thr controller object does not let me choose a file, so what is the correct path+extension there? the compiler gives me  a message:<br>"Using controller object: /patches/chooser1/chooser1.axp<br>Unable to created controller for : /patches/chooser1/chooser1.axp"</p>

<p>so its unable to do...what?</p>
