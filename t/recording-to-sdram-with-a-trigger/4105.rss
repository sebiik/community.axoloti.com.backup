    <title>Recording to SDRAM with a trigger</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/recording-to-sdram-with-a-trigger/4105</link>
    <description>Hi all, I have a patch idea where I record the audio input to SDRAM, but only when a key is held down. If you press a new key, recording resumes. If you press an old key, the portion of audio that was recorded for that key is played back. The problem is, none of the delay objects have any trigger inputs. Is there some community object that will let me do this?</description>

              <p>This doesn't seem to work too well either. If I hold down a key and hold down a new key, the old key will start playing, and I don't think the new key will start recording until the old key has been let go. Or maybe the old key is overwriting the new key.</p>

<p>basically,you can press a bunch of keys now and record a lot of samples in realtime..<br>I will think about some way of memory defragmentation come the time...</p>

              <p>I don't think "sample defragmentation" will be very useful, at least for my use-case. What I want to do is have an instrument playing live, and for me to cut out the notes and be able to play them back immediately if need be. I probably won't even implement save/load.</p>
