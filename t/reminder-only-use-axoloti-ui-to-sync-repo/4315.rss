    <title>Reminder: only use Axoloti UI to sync repo</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/reminder-only-use-axoloti-ui-to-sync-repo/4315</link>
    <description>Please can I remind users only to use the Axoloti UI to &#39;sync&#39; changes to the community libraries.
(do not use native git commands/tools) 

we have had a number of issues recently where users have been unable to sync, because another user has (inadvertently) changed their files. the axoloti UI prevents this happening ... but if some users side step this by using native git commands, then its very easy to screw this up if you don&#39;t take care/think it through. 

I recognise for some more experienced users this is a limitation, but its vital that we do not create merge conflict situations. the majority of users have neither the experience/nor tools and setup to resolve them.
this is why I chose a very simple workflow/model - to keep it simple for all.

if you do are an experience developer with git experience, then sure you can do it, but only if you ensure:
- any change you commit ONLY affects your files - NO exceptions!
- you keep the operations simple, to ensure there can be no conflicts (e.g. i dont want to see history changes) 

in the end , if you do stuff, and I don&#39;t get issues from other users, then I don&#39;t care too much... 
Im only coming banging on your door if its F&#39; up ;) 
 
**please this is important, this potentially affects all users... and when it goes wrong, I end up spending quite a bit of time resolving the issues ... and frankly, Im getting a bit tired of it**</description>
