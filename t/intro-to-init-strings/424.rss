    <title>Intro to init strings?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/intro-to-init-strings/424</link>
    <description>Hi - most likely a problem of lack of c programming experience, but I am wondering what sorts of things can be done with the init scripts of table buffer allocation objects or if there are any other &quot;initi on patch load&quot; script objects.

I have everything working quite nicely in an instrument, but I am not sure how to auto-load samples into my tables (always have to click a button to pass file name string).

Originally i was aiming to have a drop down that is populated by filenames that i can cycle through with a controller, but I think it isn&#39;t possible with current implementation of drop downs (can&#39;t walk through the list with a controller) - so its kind of a wrong path to what i need anyway.

I am not sure how to deal with 227 files that i would like to load from the sdcard, but shouldn&#39;t be hard to figure out..and i have a feeling i will need to use script objects that run on patch init, or at least the first sample in the list should be autoloaded. After that I can wire up some sort of interface that will cycle through the options (although a 227 muxer sounds like an awful thing to wire up hehe).</description>
