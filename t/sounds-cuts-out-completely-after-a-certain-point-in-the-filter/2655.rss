    <title>Sounds cuts out completely after a certain point in the filter?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/sounds-cuts-out-completely-after-a-certain-point-in-the-filter/2655</link>
    <description>I know what you&#39;re thinking, &quot;it&#39;s supposed to do that.&quot;  But hear me out:

The filter does not affect the sound at all, and at a certian point it just cuts the signal completely.  And I do not know why.  I think it&#39;s because the &quot;v&quot; in the gain/vca is coming from a potentiometer, but  I&#39;m not sure.  The filter is the demo 4 pole filter example.

<p>The <strong>gpio/in/analog</strong> works the same like when you would connect a <strong>ctrl/dial p</strong> object to the pitch inlet of your filter. This means that these are only positive values. So you need to convert the incoming signal to a bipolar signal with a <strong>conv/unipolar2bipolar</strong> object. Best to leave the pitch dial of the filter object at 0.00 as well, so your potentiometer will controll the full range of the filter.</p>

<p>The resonance inlet of the filter can be connected directly to <strong>gpio/in/analog</strong>, since the resonance dial goes from 0 to 64.</p>

              <p>so, when you disconnect the gpio and instead use a dial directly from the patcher it behaves differently?</p>
