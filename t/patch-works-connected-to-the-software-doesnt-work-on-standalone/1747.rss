    <title>Patch works connected to the software / doesn&#39;t work on standalone</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/patch-works-connected-to-the-software-doesnt-work-on-standalone/1747</link>
    <description>Hi,

I&#39;ve made a patch based on the wave/play object, triggered by a midi/in object. I copied some raw (.wav) files on the sd card, in a folder with the name of the patch.
When I&#39;m connected with the software, I manage to trigger the files&#39; streaming with my midi keyboard connected to the midi IN of the Axoloti Core. Everything&#39;s fine.
In the patch, I select &quot;upload to sdcard as startup&quot;, then disconnect the Core, then power up the Core with a DC adaptator to play the patch on standalone mode. 
Even though I didn&#39;t change anything in my hardware setup (midi cables, midi channel, audio cables, mixer) from the previous situation, I can&#39;t trigger any sound from the axoloti Core.

Windows 10
Axoloti 1.0.10

Did I miss something ?

PS : I tried &quot;upload to sdcard as startup&quot; with a synth patch, it worked fine.
PPS : I ran a SD benchmark on my SD Card ; seems fine.</description>

              <p>be careful with execution order.... (this may be your issue) </p>

<p>execution is strictly left to right, top to bottom...<br>so if you want things executed sequential, the top of the objects must all be at the same height.<br>your patch, will be executing in a rather 'unexpected' way, i suspect <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=2" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>its worth spending some time understanding execution order in the beginning, as with more complex patches, it can lead to some really nasty bugs, which can be avoided by getting into good habits from the start.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a>, does the automatic uploading of resource files, have/need a special case for the startup? as it wont be in a subdirectory with patch name.<br>(don't think it applies here since this is using dynamic filenames)</p>

              <p>Thank you guys, it worked.<br>I understand this : if the patch is uploaded as startup on sdcard, the compiled patch is on the root of the sdcard, and if I don't specify the path, the wave/play object seeks the files on the root.</p>

<p>Here's a screenshot of my patch. It's a subpatch used in polyphonic mode (2 voices, with more voices the dsp is not full but there are artefacts in the sound).</p>

<p>I used a brief timer/delaypulse in order to trigger the file corresponding to the note pressed (eg A033). If I don't do that the wave/play triggers the sound of the note pressed before. It's perhaps a dirty solution but it works.</p>

              <p>agreed it sounds like it can't find wave file.</p>

<p>in  wave/play try using something like<br></p>

<p></p><pre><code>/mywave.raw</code></pre>

<p>perhaps post a screenshot of your patch so we can see it.</p>

<p>also it would be useful to see the contents of the sdcard, <br>i.e. where is the raw file located?</p>

              <p>I had the same problem some time ago, and I think it has something to do with the path of the RAW sample files on the SD card. I had to put them in the root of the SD card for it to be found by the startup patch (and not in a folder)</p>
