    <description>Hi all,

I know this has been covered in the forum, but digging through all the past posts I am still confused.  I just want to do this basic thing:   load a specific patch from the SD card based on a specific input MIDI pgm change message.  That is:  I want a specific pgm change message (e.g. &quot;12&quot;) to trigger loading a specific patch by name.  How do I pull this off? 

(note that I don&#39;t want to work with pgm changes 1-10, intentionally, because I am dealing with some annoying hardware defaults and I want to use low pgm change numbers to do other things)

Any help is much appreciated!</description>

              <p>Aha, I have solved my own problem.  Sometimes it is hard to tell if I am completely misunderstanding something or if I just have a simple confusion or bug with how I am navigating the filesystems and conventions with the Axoloti.  This was a case of the latter! </p>

<p>For my own future reference and for anyone else who needs to do this kind of thing (e.g. control the patches to load using a customized set of MIDI input messages from whatever hardware you are using), the right way to do this is to make a controller object subpatch.  Basically I followed these steps:<br>- made a little mini patch (to be saved as a subpatch) that takes in and selects for the MIDI messages I want to use (only pgm change messages over 10, in my case).  It then uses the string/indexed and patch/load fn objects to pick and load a filename based on the pgm change number.<br>- renamed my set of patches so that they work with this indexing convention (e.g. "PATCH_011" and so on) and uploaded them each to the axoloti.<br>- saved my little mini controller patch as a subpatch (.axs) in the 'controller' directory that axoloti uses (which I found by searching for the pgmchange.axs subpatch that is "factory-provided" to do patch switching).<br>- in the preferences menu, set my new subpatch as the controller object.</p>

<p>A couple of "gotchas" that had me stuck... finding the right place to put the subpatch, and the right syntax for expressing its path/name in the preferences menu; also getting the syntax right in the string/indexed object so that it finds the patches correctly once they are uploaded to the axoloti.</p>

<p>The most useful threads/messages for getting unstuck were:<br><a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/how-to-use-controller-object/910/2?u=kat">https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/how-to-use-controller-object/910/2?u=kat</a> (describes how to make a controller object and how to modify the preferences settings)<br><a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/help-with-program-change-and-patch-load/1961/4?u=kat">https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/help-with-program-change-and-patch-load/1961/4?u=kat</a> (for getting the syntax right in the string/indexed object)</p>

              <p>This can be done. I think to skip over the first ten program numbers though you might have to do something clever... like maybe create a 'null' patch to populate the first ten slots of the bank.</p>

<p>I've just gone through this process but I'm not at home so unless someone else steps up, you'll have to wait a couple of days for a 'step-by-step'.</p>
