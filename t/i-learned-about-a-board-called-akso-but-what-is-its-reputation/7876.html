        <p>I tried to order the akso a couple of years ago, but never got any response back.<br>I think he has the same problem as the axoloti.. no more chips available, which won't be fixed any time soon..</p>

<p>Only possible "quick" fix would be to use a different chip, which probably means re-writing a l√≥t of the program for both hardware and software, so you can actually forget the "quick". Only way now is to get them second-hand.</p>

        <p>AKSO was a hugely promising follow up project to the axoloti, but unfortunately it "burnt out" its developer (you can read his posts about that on the akso forum). when it was announced, i immediately ordered two boards, which still function, even with some kinks in the software the dev never got to ironing out.<br>it has more processing power, more ram and it can work with eurorack levels in and out (0-10V and -5 - 5V). and a smaller general footprint.</p>

        <p>I feel that the depletion of axoloti core is making the community closed. I want to spread such a wonderful board to more people. But that doesn't work. Thanks for all the replies.</p>

        <p>There have been attempts to revive axoloti, at least in another form (Eurorack or stompbox pedal), not only by me. Though currently I am facing the issues mentioned above, mainly chip availability and lack of funding trying to fix my prototypes. I have not given up at all though and quietly been working on the board designs.</p>
