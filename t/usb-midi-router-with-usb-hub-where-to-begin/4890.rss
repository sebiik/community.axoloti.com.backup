    <title>USB midi router with USB hub: where to begin?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/usb-midi-router-with-usb-hub-where-to-begin/4890</link>
    <description>Sorry about the n00b question, but I am somewhat lost. I wish to use a USB hub to connect various USB midi devices and virtually connect them. It is my understanding that the most recent version of the patcher (1.0.12-2, though the app shows 1.0.12)) would allow this. My board is on firmware 1.0.0.1

I found the tb/midi/utils/midithru, but just trying all combos and setting it to &quot;live&quot; does nothing (no LED action either). Should I modify the menus to represent the names of the devices I have connected? How do I find the names?

I would be very grateful if anybody could point me in the right direction.</description>
