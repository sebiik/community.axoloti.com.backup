        <p>So I have been playing with my axoloti for a month or so without any issues, but it suddenly stopped working yesterday &amp; the voltage regulator is getting really hot. I have been using a teensy 3.6 as a usb midi controller running into the usb host port for extra controls powering the teensy from the host port. I have been powering the axoloti through the micro usb port with a usb power brick as is was a pretty simple solution for portable jamming.<br>I had run separate 5v to the teensy at some point during the build process, but ran into pretty serious ground loop type noise, so I just ended up running it off the host port instead. </p>

<p>I have another 2 axolotis on the way to me now, and wanted to know:<br>-Is there a solution for me to keep this from happening again? <br>-Would powering it from a 9v source change anything? <br>-Is there a way to avoid the noise I was getting when using a separate power source to the teensy?<br>Also, I took a look at the schematic and it appears to be the 3v regulator (ld117as33tr), would there be any other components I should look at replacing if I where to attempt to repair this board? I haven't had the chance to take any voltage readings yet, but the only part getting noticeably hot was the regulator. Is it even worth trying?</p>

<p>Thanks for any help!</p>
