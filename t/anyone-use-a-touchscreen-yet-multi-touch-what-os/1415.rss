    <title>Anyone use a touchscreen yet? Multi-touch? What Os?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/anyone-use-a-touchscreen-yet-multi-touch-what-os/1415</link>
    <description>Hello there.

I just ordered the Core device last night and i am already scheming ways to make this a synth i want to use everyday and that won&#39;t do just one thing. So i am thinking of having a cheap used Touch-screen Tablet computer running Win7, 8, or 10 mounted in the case dedicated to running the Axoloti editing software. 

Has anyone tried this software with a touchscreen device? Was it Multi-touch and did that work? If so what os? I know that the Nord Modular software had problems with touch-screens and bamboo pads. 

Second, has anyone been able to run this software on an iPad with a Java running app? or Android? I have a first Gen iPad  in an Alesis I-O Dock that would be great to integrate into a case as the editing machine but i figure that might be too much to ask.</description>

<p>we will need to move to javaFX to get windows tablet support we already partially use javaFX, so that is a possibility, but means moving further in that direction.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the quick answers.</p>

<p>I was thinking of something like the SunVox, or maybe a smaller version of the NeKo from Open labs, or the Korg Kronus. That I can take to cafes or gigs and lessons</p>

<p>I have an old telephone pad0-9 unit that sends patch-bank-lsb-msb over 5-pin din and it kind of looks like the pad on a Fairlight so that is getting integrated for “standalone” play so that might be the visual theme of all black and white, but I KINDA WANT Nord Red.</p>

<p>But I may go portable practical and put it in a Pelican case or an old Samsonite that can fold open with touchscreen on the top case cover like a laptop screen and all the controls on the horizontal surface.</p>

<p>I have a few other nice parts to stir into the stew. I have the guts to an old Oberhiem PerfX Drummer for some auto rhythm, a 12 trigger to midi out drum converter, an Arturia beatstep (regular), small midi keys, an iTouch running Lemur, and a couple midi merges and routers.</p>

<p>I figure these plus some slick looking long throw sliders or contact ribbons to top it off should great overkill and the tablet that is editing with the Axoloti Software can serve some other basic functions...maybe a simple Lemur like prorgam or a smallish Daw like FLstudio. I found a good 1900-1200 res tablet for 100 bucks so that should be enough detail to move the blocks even on a 9 inch screen and i am ok with one finger at a time.</p>

              <p>Yeah i run Lemur on all my iPads and was thinking about making a custom controller for the Axoloti. As it is I think i will install an iTouch 2nd gen running Lemur as a small controller if i can get some sort of connection. Most likely a wireless through the lemur daemon on the computer running the editor too since USB-midi was never implemented on that gen of iTouch.</p>

  <blockquote>Hey. 

I made two objects for integrating Axoloti and the Behringer BCF2000 controller. 

The BCF has flying faders and illuminated knobs and buttons that you can control with MIDI parameter feedback. Basically that just means sending the same CC that's assigned to a control back to it. If your fader sends CC #20, send CC #20 back to it and it jumps to the value you sent. You can control the LEDs in the buttons and around the encoders in the same way. I think a lot of controllers do this now but…

              <p>I think its a good idea to split two 'usages' , as they have different solutions/options.</p>

<p>a) running/controlling/selecting patches <br>this requires no java, and communication can be done via midi etc.<br>so things like an iPad or any other control surface could work</p>

<p>b) editing/creating patches<br>you need a java environment, so that rules out an iPad, but presumably not android.<br>you also need to be able to compile that patch and upload it, not impossible on an android but may be slow, and take work.<br>touch screen should work, but there is no specific support, so like most applications its going to be like using a tablet i.e single touch , a bit 'mouse like' -  but wont have multi touch or many gestures. (other than those supplied by the underlying OS).<br>to get such support would require someone develops it (Im not likely to get a surface any time soon, I don't know about johannes)  </p>

<p>note: im also not sure of the current support in Java and Windows 10 of multi touch, but that will be something who plans to implement it to investigate <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> </p>

<p>one final point, personally, Id say without explicit support, a touch screen might be a bit 'fiddly' in particular dragging the connections around which are pretty small, for touch screen you'd probably want something with smart 'connections' , and also an integrated zoom function. (the later may be part of the OS, so might already work) </p>

<p>anyway, just thoughts, would be interesting to hear from users than have tried... it may be Im being a bit too conservative, and it works fine as is.</p>

<p>btw <a class="mention" href="/users/cube48">@cube48</a> showed a nice video of SunVox working on a touch screen, which is not very different...<br>see this thread : <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/raspberry-pi-zero-axo-masterkeyboard-display/705/7">https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/raspberry-pi-zero-axo-masterkeyboard-display/705/7</a></p>
