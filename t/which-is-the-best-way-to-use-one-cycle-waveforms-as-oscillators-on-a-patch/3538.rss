    <title>Which is the best way to use one cycle waveforms as oscillators on a patch?</title>

    <description>Hi, I&#39;ve already made a lot of subtractive synths and patches in the axoloti and now I&#39;m looking into using it as a sampler followed by a synth like architecture and to use one cycle waveforms as oscillators in a patch.

Which modules would you recommend?</description>

<p>Try doing a search on "one cycle".  You will find a tutorial and also a patch that show how to do it. It is posted by user anon5189335, which is my old profile.</p>

    Hey guys :smile:  

I just flicked together this tutorial on how to create one cycle waveforms for Axoloti. You can use it instead on an oscillator and gives some new options. Anyway here goes:

Video of the Audacity part:  

0. Tutorial on how to make 1 cycle waveforms for Axoloti

To start with this I would like to mention that this can de done in many ways and this is just one example, but I found it to work and the wavetables created in this way, seems to be in perâ€¦
