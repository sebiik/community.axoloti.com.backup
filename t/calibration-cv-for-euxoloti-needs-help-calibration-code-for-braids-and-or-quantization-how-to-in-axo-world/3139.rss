    <title>Calibration cv for euxoloti needs help ? calibration code for braids and /or quantization how to in axo world?</title>

    <description>Can anyone help me further on getting the cv input more accurate on my euxoloti module
Since i am not into programming and more musician / who wants more options …
I build in total two models (euxo1/newer model) and having troubles with V/octv. 

integrating the mutable braids calibration and or quantizing code
which i guess can be a solution for my problem … 
Any help would be welcome
Greetz

              <p>Is it the CV input you want to calibrate to V/Oct?</p>

<p>I've been wondering about this, too. I think Paul is working on it though, so hopefully he will come up with something soon.</p>

<p>I've talked to him briefly about this, and he was saying CV input <span class="hashtag">#1</span> is the best one for accurate V/Oct calibration because it only accepts positive voltages, and therefore has twice the precision of the other CV ins.</p>

<p>from memory, the calibration code is not compiled into any of the MI modules we added into 1.0.12.<br>BUT the code can still be found in firmware/mutable instruments.<br>MI uses a pretty simple approach, taking to voltages as at known points in the scale (eg. C1 C4) , this then let means you can calculate a scaling factor, (3 oct in this can for the diff between v4-v1)... <br>from memory I think c1 is lowest, so this given you the base offset </p>

<p>as I say, its not really very complex, so probably easier to code yourself, as make it specific to axo code from the outset.<br>( I don't remember any quantisation code, but perhaps I just didn't spot it... but again we have quantizers in axo anyway)</p>
