    <title>Slow lfo for audio loop disintegration?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/slow-lfo-for-audio-loop-disintegration/6131</link>
    <description>Hi, i am fairly new to Axoloti, so excuse if this seems obvious or something...
I&#39;ve build myself a hardware controller with 5 buttons and 15 pots.
The patch which i am working on should get you the basinski disintegration loops vibe.
So i patched a looper going into some fx eg. some nasty distortion and some white noise.
What i would like to do now is to push a button and start a slow lfo with that button that sets the amount of distortion.
I got the lfo doing its thing, but i can&#39;t figure out how to start the lfo with a button.
Hope you guys know what i mean since i don&#39;t know how to explain properly.

Basic question is: how can i start the loops destruction???

Other solution would be to slowly increase distortion with each repetition of the loop...

Please help, i am absolutely clueless...</description>

              <p>sounds like you just need a mux and a toggle switch, if you simply want on/off modulation....also check out the patch and video in this thread for another Basinski style looper</p>

    Hello, I thought I’d share my little loopy synth / controller / enclosure thing I made for the Axoloti Core.  The enclosure is made out of bits of wood I found laying around and a piece of transparent black acrylic which makes for a nice display panel that sort of hides the OLED when it's turned off. I just used hand tools to build it so it’s not the tidiest but certainly works for now.

The controller 	has 7 pots, 6 buttons, an OLED and encoder. I drilled a hole in a piece…
