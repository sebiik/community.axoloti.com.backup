    <title>Has anyone looked at Composers Desktop Project?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/has-anyone-looked-at-composers-desktop-project/3165</link>
    <description>I am wondering if anyone has looked at sources for the Composers Desktop Project, these were made open source a few years ago and are written in C so I think might be interesting candidates for adapting to Axoloti.

The only thing is they are all offline processors and so will need to be adapted to work in realtime DSP but there are some interesting processes worth exploring, especially FFT ones based on the Phase Vocoder.

I am new to Axoloti and to learning C so don&#39;t really know how to do this myself (yet!) but I thought it might be worth mentioning here and ask if anyone has looked it.

I have been using the CDP offline processes for a while so do ask if you want to know more. Cheers!</description>

              <p>Thanks for looking into it, seem like it won't be a simple matter to adapt the processes.. Think I will get on with learning some C before digging in to deep!</p>

              <p>had a quick look at the code, directly compiling, would not yield good performance on axoloti and result in very big patches. (use of doubles,dynamic mem allocation, pulls in sprintf all over the place) <br>but could be interesting for coding examples which could be adapted.</p>
