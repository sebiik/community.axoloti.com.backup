    <description>Hi, new to the forums here but *not* new to forums. :p  

I love Max (I have version 8 standalone), so nothing about it really irks me except I will have to invest a fair amount of cash to upgrade my PC, then to Abelton Standard or Suite *and*  maybe a  Push 2 in order to get good hardware control of my patches. There is Midi Fighter/Faderfox/etc but it doesn&#39;t seem to be the same. That&#39;s the only thing really....Also, I would love to enventually get off Windows for music making and switch over to Linux. I was a Linux user for years until I had to swtich to Windows b/c of Ableton, etc....

So I started to looking at alternatives that weren&#39;t super expensive and found Axoloti....anyone have similar experiences and made the switch? Or they happy with it? What are some of the things they are *not* happy with, as far as the switch? Also, anyone do this that didn&#39;t have DIY experience w/ making cases, etc? 

Figured this was the only place to ask this type of thing...</description>

              <p>My 2c:<br>I'm a hardcore Gnu/Linux user. I made a ton of PD patches, mostly effects, looper/sampler things etc, and I played a lot with INGEN (a nice tool with wich you can host plugins and add some extra magic) but I never felt confident enough to use them live, with a fairly new laptop and a realtime kernel I had a decent but not satisfactory latency vs stability ratio. I play instruments through those so low latency matters a lot, maybe not your case?  3 Axolotis + some class compliant usb controllers and a lot of hard but very fun work did the job for me perfectly! A Pc-less setup that fits in a small suitcase and never let me down. Of course there are limitations, for my use case more about memory than cpu power but generally I couldn't be happier, my live setup weighting one tenth of what it used to be with hardware and being designed for my specific needs. BTW I never made a real case for it, I have the 3 axos bolted with plastic screws to the bottom of a recycled plastic box with all the cables connected going out of a single hole...</p>

              <p>Hmm, no I haven't. I will check that out today well. In fact, I have an older PC w/ Linux on it so I might try it there first. YOu can use PureData as a plugin with Bitwig?
