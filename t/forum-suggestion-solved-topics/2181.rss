    <title>Forum suggestion : solved topics?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/forum-suggestion-solved-topics/2181</link>
    <description>Hey :) 

I would like to suggest that a topic &quot;solved&quot; function should be implemented into the community. That would make it easier for everyone to find answers to their issues. The overall thread could have &quot;solved&quot; mark so when searching you can see which ones have been solved. And maybe also the post that solves the topic should have it too.

For example yesterday I posted a question about embedded objects and it was pretty quickly solved. It could be tagged as solved to make it easier for users to find &quot;definitive&quot; answers.

What do the main developers think?

@johannes @thetechnobear  

Thanks

<p>Sorry I cannot help implementing it, but I thought I'd suggest it anyway. Glad you like the idea. I have faith that you guys will implement it the way you find best.</p>

<p>Yeah ,there might be areas where it wont work, but I am pretty sure it overall will help users to get answers quicker <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=2" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>No reason other than that's what the discourse topic seemed to suggest.  I assume to encourage questions in restricted categories, and 'discussions' in others. </p>

<p>the advantage of this over tags, is users can mark the post which solves the topic, and then the original post has a link to the 'solution post'</p>

<p>(it can be configured to allow 'solved' in one certain categories, which may be useful.. say in the helpdesk area?)</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> what do think? (it needs server access to install, so up to you <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=2" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> )</p>

<p>just one note... <br>this will be as successful as community members make it as they need to mark solutions.<br>also, its only really going to work for topics that are one issue...so topic which fire different questions wont work so well.<br>(and perhaps obvious, but we moderate with a 'light touch' here, so won't be routinely marking things solved)</p>
