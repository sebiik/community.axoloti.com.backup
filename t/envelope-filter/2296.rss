    <title>Envelope Filter</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/envelope-filter/2296</link>
    <description>Hello everyone,

I&#39;m very new to the axoloti and its community but very excited to patch with it !

I&#39;m starting with something quite simple (I guess...) and already blocked. I want to do an envelope filter for my guitar like the one you can find on a stompbox. I&#39;ve searched the forum and can&#39;t find the help. 
Here where I&#39;m : I&#39;m using &quot;env/follower&quot; into the pitch of a filter. But I have a few issues:
- I have a very low data signal (the bleu cord, is that the right name?), tried to multiply it, but is that the best solution?
- I don&#39;t really understand how to have a very good idea of how my filte pitch is moving (no move of the knob of the interface, and I don&#39;t know how to have a trace of the values)
- I would like to have a min and max value for the filter pitch moved by the envelope
- I would like to control Attack and decay of my envelope, don&quot;t know how to do...

As you can see, I&#39;m blocked (and it&#39;s probably stupid)!
Thanks for your help!</description>

              <p>You could disconnect the pitch inlet of the filter and instead assign the pitch of the filter to midi cc 1..... And then connect everything as on the picture:</p>

<p>This will give you a visual of how the knob is actually moving.</p>

<p>Also check this patch from <a class="mention" href="/users/janvantomme">@janvantomme</a>. This is an autowah that works pretty decent:</p>

<p>I've made the change and here is what I have.<br>It's way better but:<br>- I need so much to know the range of value of "follow" also for the Kscope<br>- I need to calm down the follower<br>- and how to have a better control on attack decay?</p>

<p>thats one way, use the shift operator (&lt;&lt;) which is more efficient.<br>also if you have an issue with input gain, consider using the multiple/shift on the audio input, and/or use the audio/inconfig to raise the gain. (or boost the input signal <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">) </p>

<p>terminology: all the wires (blue, yellow, green etc) <em>except red</em>, we tend to call control rate wires/signals, red are audio rate.</p>

<ul><li>I don't really understand how to have a very good idea of how my filte pitch is moving (no move of the knob of the interface, and I don't know how to have a trace of the values)</li></ul>

<p>look at the kscope object <br>(help patch will give you  an idea of how to use it)</p>

<ul><li>I would like to have a min and max value for the filter pitch moved by the envelope</li></ul>

<p>use * to get a range, and then + to get the min value</p>

<ul><li>I would like to control Attack and decay of my envelope, don"t know how to do...</li></ul>

<p>use an env/ad object , and multiply its output by the output of 'range' you did above.<br>(again help patch shows how, just remember it can be used on both audio and control signals)</p>

<p>no question is 'stupid' or simple, its simply a matter of practice/experience, we all were beginners at some point, and relied on others to help us get going.<br>so fire away <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  </p>

<p>tip: a good way to get help here is:<br>a) publish a screenshot on this forum<br>b) share the patch on the forum</p>

<p>id recommend doing both, then others can see 'where you are at'<br>(a) is useful, as we can help without firing up axoloti<br>(b) is useful if there are issues, so we can test with axoloti, and also potentially post a modified patch.</p>

<p>anyway, hope the above unblocks you, happy patching<br>Mark</p>
