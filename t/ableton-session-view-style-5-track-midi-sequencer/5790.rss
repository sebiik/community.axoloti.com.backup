    <description>Hi all,

I&#39;m still working on this but it&#39;s close to finished so thought I&#39;d share.

It&#39;s a 5 track midi Looper inspired by Ableton live&#39;s session view.

There&#39;s 4 melodic tracks, each is 6 note polyphonic with 7 clip slots. It records notes quantized to 16ths but retains the note length (if you see what I mean) and also records any cc&#39;s, pitch bend or aftertouch on the channel the track is listening too. Here I&#39;m using it to drive a bass-station 2 and mininova (2 tracks each). Each slot can record up to 16 bars. You can also set a maximum record time in bars so it automatically stops recording and starts playback.

The 5th track is a 9 note polyphonic drum sequencer that records 4 bars per slot and has reverb, and pitch automaton. It&#39;s driving an axoloti drum machine.

There&#39;s also a chorus, a synced delay and a reverb (not used in the video).

Sorry for the crap sound/playing, was just testing.

It&#39;s all running on 3 axolotis, 2 tracks on one, 2 tracks plus fx on another, and drum machine and it&#39;s sequencer on the third

I&#39;ll post a better video and the patches/objects once I&#39;ve finished it. Got a couple of bugs to iron out and some tidying up to do!

              <p>So, here's the patches for my 3x axoloti setup</p>

<p>Trevor is the drum machine and midi router for the other axolotis/synths.</p>

<p>Malcolm is the launchpad axoloti that has the sequencing for track/column 3 and 4</p>

<p>Rodney is the track/column 1 and 2 axoloti, along with a chorus, synced delay and reverb. It also uses launch control xl midi for fx control, play button and external midi sync button.</p>

<p>The drum machine sequencing/track is a bit different from the other sequencing, as it's mostly controlled from an mpd pad controller (I like having the controls near/on the pads). But the launchpad does control the drum machine sequence changes.</p>

<p>I've ironed out the bugs i've come across and everything seems very stable (so far!).</p>

<p>A standalone 1 axoloti and a launchpad version, plus proper objects and an explanation, is coming soon!</p>

              <p>Cheers!</p>

<p>It's all synced using midi.</p>

<p>I have a usb midi interface connected to the drum machine axoloti, the other axolotis and the synths are plugged into the interface dins.</p>

<p>The drum machine axoloti routes the midi to/from the other axolotis and the synths. The launchpad is connected to one of the other axolotis.</p>

<p>So, for the bass station tracks the midi chain is:</p>

<p>Bass station-drum axo- axo1 sequencer-drum axo-bass station.</p>

<p> And the launchpad controls for the same tracks are: <br>launchpad- axo2- drum axo- axo1 sequencer- drum axo- axo2- launchpad <br>(goes back for led feedback)</p>

<p>The drum axoloti recieves midi clock and sends a particular note at 4ppq to the other axolotis, which drives their sequencers.</p>

<p>I'm amazed it works so well!</p>

<p>I'm pretty new to code and don't really know what a baud rate is! I guess standard?  I learnt what I know from messing around with other midi and table objects.</p>

<p>If it's of interest, the midi interface is a miditech midiface 4x4, seems rock solid so far.</p>

<p>I'll get the patches up soonish, and I'm planning on making a version that works with one axoloti and a launchpad, it'll probably have less polyphony or something. I'll try and squeeze in as much as the sram will let me!</p>

              <p>Awesome job! Would love to see the project file once you finished it!</p>

<p>How do you sync the 3 axos, midi? if so at the standard baud rate or faster?</p>
