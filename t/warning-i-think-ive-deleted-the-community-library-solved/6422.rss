    <title>WARNING I think I&#39;ve deleted the community library (SOLVED)</title>

    <description>Hi all,

 DON&#39;T SYNC YOUR LIBRARY

I was uploading some objects and when I resynced it looks like I&#39;ve somehow deleted the rest of the library as it&#39;s only showing my stuff... My friend synced his library and lost the other objects too.

I&#39;m really really sorry, I didn&#39;t know it was even possible and have no idea how I did it!

Help!

I have the library backed up on my hard drive</description>

              <p>you deleted other objects from the community library, then pushed the change.</p>

<p>I have reverted all your commits today,<br>so the library is back as it was before your changes</p>

<p><strong>so the issue is now solved</strong></p>

<p>so BEFORE you reset your library again, make sure you have a copy of YOUR objects, as when you do a reset your objects will disappear.</p>
