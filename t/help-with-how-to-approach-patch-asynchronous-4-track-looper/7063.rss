    <title>Help with/How to approach patch (Asynchronous 4 Track Looper)</title>

    <description>Hello friends,

New to the Axoloti Platform, and while I have some limited experience with pure data and Max/MSP, I&#39;m finding myself stumped on starting this patch I&#39;m dreaming up. Any help or direction would be much appreciated.

What I&#39;m looking to do, is create a 4 track looper with 4 independently dynamically manipulatable buffers. Ideally, each buffer would have controls to manipulate the length of the buffer as well as start/end position, and fine and coarse pitch/speed control i.e. tape speed. A button for recording and playback of each track, as well as an erase function on each track. These are the essentials of what I am trying to create here, but it would be even cooler if I could implement a switch which enables a sync between all four tracks so that length becomes fixed to what is set by track 1&#39;s parameters. Anyone give me any pointers on how to make this happen if any of it is even possible with this platform?</description>

<p>I'm working on some new objects that will make patching this pretty easy,<br>actually I've been doing my head in about syncing,but I'm almost there.<br>I seriously hope it will not take me another year, harhar...</p>

              <p>Wonderful and thank you! It looks like Rbrts stuff is definitely going to get me going. Will take sometime to figure out how all this works together I think, but looks very promising. I'll be back when I hit a wall. Thanks again.</p>

              <p>Hi welcome....</p>

<p>Check out Rbrts looper objects and help patches help/library/community/rbrt/looper and Lpr they have the bones of what you are looking for.</p>

<p>There is also sss/delay/loop4 which as a basic 4 track looper with great with bouncing capability, but no pitch, and not asynchronous, his Factotum object too which is amazingly flexible ....those are the best places to look, and slightly different approaches....once you've had a look at those come back and we can discuss it further...have fun</p>

<p>or go basic with table record/read objects and build from there, I think Mytas also has a looper based on delays in his community Sebti folder, his video fun with delays is also quite helpful for that approach <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL05R3xbR9I" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> all his patching videos are quite nice for orientating yourself initiallly</p>

<p>Best of Luck</p>
