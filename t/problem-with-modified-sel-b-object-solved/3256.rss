    <title>Problem with modified sel b object - SOLVED</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/problem-with-modified-sel-b-object-solved/3256</link>
    <description>Hi
I&#39;m trying to modify a sel b object so that is sends out sequenced midi note-on&#39;s and note-off&#39;s (both internally to control a poly synth patch and also externally (but I haven&#39;t tried that yet). The idea is that a counter advances through the horizontal grid; if a cell is highlighted then a midi-note-on is output for a specific note allocated to that row. A non-highlighted cells sends a midi-note-off. If two highlighted (or non-highlighted) cells are next to each other then repeat messages are suppressed.... meaning a midi-off must always follow a midi-on. I put 8 of these rows together with note selector fields to produce a simple polyphonic step sequencer. So here&#39;s the code for one such row:

bool m1; (in &quot;local data&quot;)
m1=0; (in &quot;Init Code&quot;)

if (  bool((param_1&gt;&gt;inlet_step)&amp;1)  != m1  ){
      PatchMidiInHandler(MIDI_DEVICE_INTERNAL,0,MIDI_NOTE_ON,param_note1,m1*127);
      m1=!m1;
}

((param_1&gt;&gt;inlet_step)&amp;1) is to read each step and returns a TRUE when the step cell is highlighted. I had to add a bool cast as it wouldn&#39;t work otherwise. m1 is a flag to remember whether the last command was a midi-on or midi-off...detecting when a cell state changes. If consecutive cells are the same then repeat midi messages are prevented. I&#39;m using a midi-note-on with velocity zero (m1==0) to achieve a midi-note-off.
So here&#39;s the problem:  it works, but the non-highlighted cells produce the midi-on!! This doesn&#39;t make sense to me. Bizarrely changing the  != to == produces the correct effect, but not on the first cycle. Nothing happens on the first run through the row then all starts working correctly.
Can anyone help explain what I&#39;m doing wrong?
Cheers!
Paul

              <p>Got it. Two probs...<br>1. m1=!m1 should be before midi statement and this explains "inverted" behaviour<br>2. I was using square wave LFO as clock source and this commences with a leading +ve edge effectively skipping zero in the counter I was using to drive the sequencer. Applied a logic invert and I now have a leading logic low and behaviour is as expected (though that first low seems shorter than subsequent pulses)<br>Cheers<br>Paul</p>
