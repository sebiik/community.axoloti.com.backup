    <description>Hey!

Some days ago I updated my Axoloti to the build from Github, which has been great in many ways. But today I tried opening an older larger patch, which used to work. But now I get this error every time I make the patch live. Dont now if it related to the update, but that is the ony ting I have changed. Anyway:

Error message:
/axoloti-master/build/xpatch.cpp:2487:6: error: &#39;net5&#39; was not declared in this scope

I get a few of them, for net5, net6, net7, net10 and net30.

Any ideas?</description>

<p>Seems like all the trouble I have had with Axoloti, like noise from powersupply on Axoloti output, Cpu spikes, etc is sorted out. At least havent encountered any of them yet <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

              <p>hmm, well the 'net' numbers are the wire connections, and I'm not sure why they would disappear.</p>

<p>if you are using object search paths (which of course your not <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ) then it could you have changed your path since you last used it?<br>or object has changed such that an inlet/outlet has been removed.<br>don't think this is likely on factory objects, but perhaps if you have changed your sub patches?</p>

<p>would need to see the patch to be sure whats going on .</p>

<p>what you could try is saving the patch (as new patch so you don't loose original), its possible when you do this it will be missing some wires. (actually already missing in the UI)</p>
