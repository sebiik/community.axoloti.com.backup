    <title>No Power to Pins after installing Pin Header?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/no-power-to-pins-after-installing-pin-header/5688</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve got a temporary case that i&#39;ve been using for a while with 8 footswitches.  I just loosely had the 3.3v and all 8 switches wired to the board unsoldered which worked fine for the past few months.  I finally got the pin header soldered on and hooked everything up back where I had it but, unfortunately, I don&#39;t seem to be getting any kind of signal on any of my switches

I don&#39;t currently have a multimeter on my to test if it is really not getting any power (will later this week when my friend brings it up) but in the mean time, is there anything that could have happened while soldering? I&#39;m not seeing any bridge connections or anything like that and no damage to the board as far as I can tell</description>

              <p>Well, not really sure what the issue was but everything is working now.  Board tested fine with the multimeter and then I reconnected the first switch with a new wire and it tested fine...hooked all the old wires back up and everything works as normal</p>

<p>Chalk it up to human error</p>

              <p>Yeah thats the strange thing - all the patches I had on there work fine, loading patches still works fine, midi controller (akai mpk mini) still works for playing keys, changing patches, triggering effects, etc - just nothing on my switches anymore</p>

<p>I assume if I had somehow did some damage to the board soldering the header on then nothing would work?</p>

              <p>does the board still work fine apart from the switches not working, can you load a patch onto it and get sound out of it?</p>

              <p>Bumping...hoping someone has an idea what I could have done haha</p>

<p>Have a shot of the board with the header on - will try to grab a shot of the bottom when I am home tonight but as far as I remember, all the solder points actually look pretty good.  No bridged connections, don't think I heated it up too much to do any damage as it went quickly and I alternated sides I soldered on</p>

<p>Wont have a multimeter to test the connections until tomorrow night</p>
