              <p>Prebuilt binaries for the cross-compiler toolchain to build binaries for the ARM chip on a non-ARM platform are only available for the i686 platform.  It only works on x86_64 because 32bit binaries can be run there with a 32bit libc.</p>

<p>There does not seem to be a release of the toolchain for the PowerPC platform, so you would have to compile the cross-compiler toolchain from source.  Unfortunately, GNU Guix has not yet been ported to PowerPC, so you cannot just use my Guix packages to build and install the toolchain.</p>

<p>Building a cross-compiler from scratch in an uncontrolled environment is pretty hard as you have little control over what tools, libraries and headers are available at build time.  (It's made a lot easier with Guix as packages are built and installed in an isolated environment.)</p>

<p>Once you've got a working <code>arm-none-eabi</code> cross-compiler with multilib enabled, a properly patched release of the cross-binutils, and a cross-build of newlib-nano (just "newlib" with the below-mentioned configure flags), the rest is comparatively easy to build.</p>

<p>These are the configure flags to pass for newlib:</p>

<pre><code>"--target=arm-none-eabi"
"--enable-multilib"
"--disable-newlib-supplied-syscalls"
"--enable-newlib-reent-small"
"--disable-newlib-fvwrite-in-streamio"
"--disable-newlib-fseek-optimization"
"--disable-newlib-wide-orient"
"--enable-newlib-nano-malloc"
"--disable-newlib-unbuf-stream-opt"
"--enable-lite-exit"
"--enable-newlib-global-atexit"
"--enable-newlib-nano-formatted-io"
"--disable-nls"</code></pre>

<p>Since you say that you are a "complete noob with linux" I don't think that building the cross-compiler from scratch will be feasible for you.</p>

              <p>can this work... in theory, yes.</p>

<p>there is nothing in the axoloti UI or compiler code which is particular flavour of Linux, <br>its all cross-platform which is why it runs on Windows/OSX/Linux <br>BUT the issue is getting the platform setup correctly, with correct versions of software <br>this CAN take quite a bit of effort, and needs some experience of configuring the platforms and also looking at versions of software required... sometimes this is easy, other times its hard... and will sometimes mean compromise is required.<br>see the issue someone is having on GUIX Linux <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/stuck-in-dfu-mode-guix-linux/811">here</a></p>

<p>EDIT: I'm started a thread which will hopefully start highlighting issues/requirements etc for other platforms, but could take quite a while to make it meaningful - <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/installing-axoloti-on-an-unsupported-platform/861/1">here</a></p>
