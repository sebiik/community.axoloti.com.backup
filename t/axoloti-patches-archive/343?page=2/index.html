<p>Looking over at Discourse.org, one of the first posts on the forum is a guy who implemented a chat function that looks like a completely seemless integration. It can be done.</p>

<p>But I'm going to try and stay out of the discussion, though. I do web stuff all day so I'm not going to contribute to such a project in my spare time, so I should leave the decisioning to those who will <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile"></p>

        <p>well, i have been working on something, namely a simple patch database.</p>

<p>here's the link: <a href="http://inaba.nl/" rel="nofollow">inaba.nl</a></p>

<p>as of now, only i can upload patches and edit the site.</p>

<p>i got about 20gb of storage on there, which is way more than enough.</p>

<p>if one wants their subpatch or complete patch on there, just private message me with a description, features, tags and application notes and the patch (.axs for subpatch, .zip for complete patch)</p>

        <p>I just deployed a drupal site, the axoloti patch / sub-patch (with most fields OP requested in first post) is working as a content type. Right now, anonymous users are able to create accounts (to post stuff), or download patches without logging in. It's a pretty nice little web application for just having started a couple of hours ago. I am going to spend a day or so theming the site and making it tolerable to use and to look at. after that, I will give full details on where to go. <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> stay tuned.</p>

<blockquote><p>There is a need for a simple map/root with al the patches that are uploaded here because now it is a bit frustrating finding those gems for learning purposes.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>the uploading of patches here, was kind of a 'stop gap' solution, a shared library has always been the intention.</p>

<p>I dont promise that it will solve all 'finding' issues, if your familiar with other platforms (max/reaktor), you'll be familiar even there sometimes it can be hard to find what your after.<br>but at least having things in one place will mean its easy to access everything ... and of course start sharing for others in the community too.</p>

        <p>I must say i cant find many patches here on this forum but that good be my issue having add <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"><br>You are right on the reactor patch finder but I actually love the simplicity of the G2 patch archive at electro-music.<br>It uses category and I just use the search option in my browser. But there are already great suggestions in this topic!</p>

<p>On a side note: this is by far the best forum I have come across in all of my forum live! The layout , the interaction and automatic updates even if you use the back button on your browser, exactly knowing what new topics have been created and so many more stuff is so great! It is so user friendly it blows my mind. kudos for the creator! <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/cake.png?v=0" title=":cake:" class="emoji" alt=":cake:"></p>

        <p>the G2 archive is nice, and we could have done the same here, it has two issues for us:<br>- its pretty limited in the way it can be integrated into an application (or at least would be on our forum software (discourse)), <br>- its hard to extend past a simple category hierarchy , and these days people want tags and all sorts of searching mechanisms</p>

<p>I guess, our expectations have moved on since the G2 archive was created... and you hear the same about the Reaktor library too.</p>

<p>but I personally think, the most important aspect of these libraries is CONTENT... you can have a fancy website for a library, but if you have no content, its pointless <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>so the user library we have coming up is a stepping stone, to something that I hope will be pretty well integrated, allowing both easy access and contributing, to build content - it will also allow us to refine the 'workflow' i.e. see how users want to organise things.</p>

<p>initially its limited, providing the most important things we need<br>- a central storage, where the patches can be accessed<br>- an easy means to access objects/patches and contribute them</p>

<p>next steps would be to add more searching/navigation possibilities.</p>

<p>importantly, should we decide to change the implementation, then it will allow us to easily move the patches to a new 'home', something which is pretty much impossible to do with patches post on the forum.</p>

<p>(you will also see, the underlying implementation is also useful for the factory library and also private libraries... so its a win win)</p>

<p>forum, yeah discourse is pretty cool isn't it ... and the more you explore the more you will find.<br>and the community members are fantastic...  which after all, is the heart of a forum <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/beers.png?v=0" title=":beers:" class="emoji" alt=":beers:"></p>

        <p>perhaps a suggestion, i have been working on a very simple php script for the idea, originally for a app-download site (for a project of mine)</p>

<p>the index file reads each folder in a main download folder.<br>in there must be a config.php file containing it's meta data, which is read, like icon, name, author, tags, ect.<br>and finally outputs it on the webpage.</p>

<p>if interested, i can upload the zip file i made, might be of help (no admin control or user uploading or editing in the browser) <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

        <p>The git based approach avoids the pain of downloading patch files and keeping up with the latest version.<br>The git patch repository could still be indexed to html pages, but then I'm not sure how a web-link could be made to open a patch from the repository rather than downloading.</p>

        <p>git could ultimately just be used as a file store, since files can be accessed directly via a url<br>e.g. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axoloti/axoloti-factory/master/objects/audio/in%20left.axo">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axoloti/axoloti-factory/master/objects/audio/in%20left.axo</a><br>(there is also a json api for most stuff in github)</p>

<p>indexing the files on access is unlikely to be efficient with a larger library, <br>it makes much more sense to index things as they submitted, but that requires a 'central' store to keep the metadata i.e. a database, which means more admin etc.<br>(ok, you could store in files, if your careful with ensuring they are not updated simultaneously, but that soon leads to inventing a database by another name <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ) </p>

<p>or you could do a 'poor mans' implementation with a periodic indexer (this 'solves' the simultaneous update issue)- yuck.</p>

<p>(oh and obvious point, it makes most sense to store the meta data in the patch/objects themselves, so that its easy to update in one place, and then index as they are submitted)</p>

<p>Id also question the advantages of using a web page, when you already have to have a application running to make use of the object/patch... seems better for workflow to have integrated in the application, rather than having to switch to a browser to find the object etc.</p>

<p>( note: i didnt say you couldn't have a web site as well... just it would not be the thing i developed first)</p>

<p>anyway, none of this is hard, complicated... or rocket science, its just takes time to develop, and their is a lot on the wish list.</p>

<p>anyway, Id suggest, we start discussing this, once the new user library is available, and start seeing contributions... if we don't see lots of contributions, its all going to be a moot point <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

        <p>This all sounds great! I think the idea of integrating an online library into the Patcher is a good one. I think that will also encourage users to submit content, so it might be good to start work on that, even it there isn't a large existing library..</p>

        <p>there is no vetting, its not practical... and not done by any user library i know of... <br>however, if there is abuse then we can remove the user from the contributors list, remove their patches and ban them for life <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>around here, a hamster without clothes is normal, so as long as the patch does something useful, i dont see the harm  <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/hamster.png?v=0" title=":hamster:" class="emoji" alt=":hamster:"></p>
