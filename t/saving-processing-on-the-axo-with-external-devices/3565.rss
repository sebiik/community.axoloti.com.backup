    <title>Saving processing on the Axo with external devices</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/saving-processing-on-the-axo-with-external-devices/3565</link>
    <description>Here is my situation,
I am a guitar player, not synth grinder, this me trying to fill the gap in-between. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
I have done a lot of work to setup midi from and Arduino Due to Axo because not enough GPIO&#39;s and other setups I have on the Due, but one thing that occurred to me is that I could send OSC triggers, to trigger a sequencer, or even a LFO etc.. But I can only see that this will have value if it saves on Axo processing.
If I already have the hardware to implement, would you recommend such a setup, and will it indeed save much processing.. ?? :thinking:</description>
