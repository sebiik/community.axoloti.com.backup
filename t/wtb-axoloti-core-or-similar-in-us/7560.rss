    <title>WTB Axoloti core (or similar!) in US</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/wtb-axoloti-core-or-similar-in-us/7560</link>
    <description>Hello! New here as well as to DIY synths in general. Hoping to get my hands on an axoloti core, or an akso, or any other sort of similar modular sound platform. I&#39;m mostly looking for something to use with my sequencer to make some cool textures and pads. 

**Does anyone know if axoloti/akso, or anything similar is in supply anywhere? Alternatively, have a used model they&#39;re willing to part with?** 


Thanks for your time.</description>
