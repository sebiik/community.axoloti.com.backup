        <p>Earlier this week, while testing my axoloti in a new wooden enclosure, it suddenly disconnected from my laptop and died. There were no signs that anything obvious had gone wrong, and at the time it was only being powered from USB so I am doubtful that anything got fried at that time. </p>

<p>IC1 was getting unusually hot, so I replaced it - this didn't change anything. One thing I noticed while testing with my multimeter is that VDD and ground seem to be shorted - though I cannot find any obvious places where this might have occured. </p>

<p>These are the voltages on my board:<br>VDD: 0.131 V<br>VDDA: 0.131V<br>VDDC: 1.31V<br>U5 is receiving 5V</p>

<p>So is my board fried? or is there anything I can do to fix it?</p>

<p>I had earlier successfully tested it with a shared 9V 1A power supply that is also powering a WTPA2 sampler and a MIDI splitter. Could there have been some damage to the board earlier if I powered it from a shared supply while connected to the computer via USB?</p>

        <p>It looks like U4 is getting really hot too. I'm wondering if the issue is just in the power supply section, and that I may be able to fix the problem by just replacing a few components near the USB input. Is this likely, or is it possible that I have fried some more crucial components?</p>
