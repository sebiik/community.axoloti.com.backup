    <title>For Sale brand new Axoloti board in US</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/for-sale-brand-new-axoloti-board-in-us/5968</link>
    <description>Hi Guys,

I am selling a brand new Axoloti board I purchased and never used.  While I was waiting for this board to arrive I found a second board used so I never used this new board when it arrived.  It was never even pulled from anti static bag.  You will be getting a As New board.  With exchange rate I paid $88.   Please send me an offer.  I am in Los Angeles if someone is local or willing to ship anywhere in the USA.  Please send me a message if interested.

Thanks</description>
