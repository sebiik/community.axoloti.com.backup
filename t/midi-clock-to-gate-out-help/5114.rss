    <title>Midi clock to gate out HELP</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/midi-clock-to-gate-out-help/5114</link>
    <description>hello good people.
i&#39;m trying to use axoloti as a midi clock to analog clock (gate\trig) converter but having difficulties.
i know the audio outs are AC-coupled so not optimal for sending gates out, but i had success syncing my modular to classic metronome sounds (i used to use octatrack metronome via headphones out to sync my modular to the octa).

first question:
which is in your opinion the best, most reliable midi clock input axoloti object?
i tried some but they all seem to drift and wobble around the clock....

The midi clock must come in via classic 5-pins DIN midi connection not via USB as i will be syncing my set with a guy&#39;s groovebox with midi clock out</description>

    Hi Axolotis 

Is it possible to synchronise a tempo from a software to Axoloti to control (for example) an arpeggiatore ? In MIDI ? In USB ? If it's possible, what kind of object can I use in the patch ? 

The software can be Max/msp, Reason or Live. 

Thanks for help FloSan

              <p>thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/scitoast">@scitoast</a> this is really valuable information!!!!<br>i ended up with this solution:<br>-clock_rx 24 ppq out<br>-drj/seq/clk_div set at 24 (to get 1 ppq out)<br>-timer/delayedpulse to get a trigger delay in order to avoid flamming, even if that means having a greater delay. i don't mind having my "1" on the other guy's "2" because i do very fractalized beats, the structure is pretty amorphous, plus i can manipulate it further on the eurorack rig<br>-table/play<br>-out</p>

<p>-table/alloc_16b sdram load on which i load up the sample available for download on makenoise website (to clock tempi)</p>

<p>it works quite well, i have to use the trigger delay because if not the tempo is right but the phase of the clock is always random, so i get random alignment. i hooked up a controller so i can delay the clock by ear and find a good compromise.</p>

<p>it's inelegant but better than a kick in the balls, as we say here <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> </p>

<p>thanks again for taking the time!<br>i think i will try your solution in the near future!<br>best!<br>g.</p>

<li><p>5V gate levels I have always found very sufficient for Eurorack.  There is no real standard, some modules output 10V or 11-ish V (very hot) gates, some 8V, but it seems like a majority of gate generating circuits out there for Eurorack do output around 5V, which happens to be standard TTL logic level anyhow.</p></li>
<li><p>the MCP6004 can source enough current to power a high efficiency LED (w 2k series resistor or so) as well as whatever module you ate feeding a clock into.  So you can have your blinky indicator lights nearly free of additional effort, if that is a reason to try this.</p></li>

              <p>Hi there,</p>

<p>I got it working quite well /reliably by using a digital i/o pin linked to a rail-to-rail op amp used as a comparator that references a constant low voltage (sufficient to change its output for logic 0 and 1 for 3.2 volt axoloti logic signals.)     Op amp: MCP6004 is good.   It is powered from the 5V Eurorack rail (so it outputs a solid 0V or +5 V as high and low).  This ends up being equivalent to a logic buffer with quite good current drive capability, so you can send the signal to passive mults etc.   The comparator simply references (‘compares to’) a fixed low voltage from a divider (you want lower than the 1.65 volt Axoloti midpoint reference but not too low to avoid noise, I think I compare to 1V.</p>

<p>I used small capacitors on the outputs I think, to smooth the edge transitions very slightly to give some additional noise exclusion.  It works really well for me and with an MCP6004 you get 4 pins of Axoloti-to-Eurorack gate goodness,  so I generally link one to midi clock, and the others to either a multiple or divisor of the clock, or to be gates gate for note events or drums etc.  <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  Happy circuiting!</p>

<p>Edit:   Ahh, sorry, I addressed the hardware side without answering your questin about midi clock objects.  For me in software there was some finagling to get a desirable outcome and very little info available about how to do this.  I do not remember off top of my head in software what I did to get a midi clock going out, will have to invstigate and follow up.</p>
