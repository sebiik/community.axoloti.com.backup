    <title>Important changes to developer mode &amp; libraries</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/important-changes-to-developer-mode-libraries/2043</link>
    <description>**(this does NOT affect anyone using a pre-built release of axoloti)** 

if you are building the Axoloti UI from github, please read this.

**we are no longer using submodules for libraries** , axoloti-factory and axoloti-contrib.
so when you pull this change you will need to reset your libraries.
here are the steps to do this cleanly.

- check you have not made any local changes to contrib and factory libraries, if you have, check them in, back them up
- git pull :)
- build axoloti , e.g. ant 
- rm -rf axoloti-contrib axoloti-factory
- rm -rf .git/modules/axoloti-contrib .git/modules/axoloti-factory
- start axoloti
- menu/preferences reset all

you will now find that in your development directory , you now have the axoloti-contrib and axoloti-factory as before, but they are independent repos.

the above, means axoloti now has unauthorised libraries... so it is likely you will now want to authorise the libraries, so you can push changes. this is done exactly in the same way as the release version.
- menu -&gt; preferences -&gt; select library -&gt; edit
- enter your user id/password, and contributor prefix (for community library)
- optionally enter revision !!
- press init

by default, development uses the master branch, (axoloti-contrib/master will changed to be a development branch)
however, it may be you want to use a release branch (1.0.10) if you know its compatible with the released version of the software.

advanced note: being an independent repo, you also may alter the associated ,git/config file if this better suits your requirements ;) 

the reason Ive made this change, is that sub repos really haven&#39;t provided us with any advantages as we maintain them separately only, as their head floats independently of the main code repo (axoloti). 
also this change means that developer mode, works with git in the same way as the &#39;released version&#39;, so there is less likelihood of different issues arising in dev mode or release. 


this is relevant ONLY going forward, and using the current development branch (master &amp;spilink)
I would recommend pulling the latest change asap, so you don&#39;t forget to do this :) 

please PM if you have any issues. 
Thanks
