<p>Help!<br>Out of curiosity (which, I should have known, killed the cat...) I entered card reader mode. The SD card never showed up on my computer (Mac OSX), so I took out the SD card, re-inserted it, and connected.</p>

<p>The <em>Axoloti</em> window shows "SDCard Mounted", but now as soon as I try to start any patch or open the File Manager in Axoloti, the terminal says "Disconnect request" and, well, disconnects.</p>

<p>Additional info</p>

<ul>
<li>the card worked fine before</li>
<li>I can take out the card and read  it using a real card reader on my Mac. Everything appears to be there. However, the card is "read only" (don't know if it was before, never tried), so I cannot reformat it either</li>
<li>without the card, the axo runs normal</li>
</ul>

<p>Please help! I need my axo for a gig!</p>

        <p>Card reader mode works here, its just a tiny bit slow.</p>

<p>One issue, that I have pointed out a few times, is that Axoloti creates patch folders in the root of the SD-card, which slows down the load time a lot, especially if you use the card read mode. So basically every patch you make, there will be created a patch in the root folder. This will sum up. I have sometimes had to clean out hundreds of patch folder at a time to keep the load times reasonable.</p>

<p>I think it would be SUPER great if we as users were allowed to be able to set a "patch folder" in preferences, where all the patches are placed in, instead of all being placed in the root, it just creates a mess and makes loading sd-card in card read mode a lot slower.</p>

<p>The read only sd-card part, there is a small slider on the side of the sd-card, which sets if an sd-card is read/write or read only. Be aware that it can be a bit hard to set it right, sometimes the slider doesnt even have to be in one or the other side, sometimes in the middle...... So Try on the computer where you know it works, to get the sllider placed so you can write to it again and then put it back into axo.</p>

        <p>PROBLEM "SOLVED"</p>

<p>The "read only" thing was due to a little hardware switch on the SD card adaptor (who knew...?). After that I reformatted the card and the Axo fired up again.</p>

<p>HOWEVER: The card reader mode still doen't work (just to be sure: the SD card is supposed to show up as a shared device on the computer?), and when I copy anything onto the card while it's in the computer's card reader slot, the Axo subsequently won't accept the card anymore, i.e. goes back to the uncooperative state described in my original post.</p>

<p>I <em>can</em> upload files in the File Manager of the Axo, but only one at a time,  which is tedious. Especially if I ever want to use samples... Any suggestions here are still welcome.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/jaffasplaffa.html">@jaffasplaffa</a>, I concur, but this is probably the wrong category...</p>

<p>Yes the files on root is probably not the issue here I agree. But it could be that one didn't wait long enough. We are talking minuts to wait, not just a moment.....</p>

<p>Anyway, did you format the sd-card on a computer or did you use the Axo tool to format it?</p>

<p>To format the card using axolotis tools:<br>- Open an empty patch<br>- Load the object util/format<br>- Follow instructions</p>
