    <title>Make phazorFm play only one cycle</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/make-phazorfm-play-only-one-cycle/5458</link>
    <description>Hi!
Unfortunately I don&#39;t have any programing knowledge, only managed to add some inlets and outlets on objects so far. So maybe this is beyond my scope, but I figured I could try.

After reading [this thread](http://community.axoloti.com/t/fm-modulation-on-samples/4925) I noticed that FM (PM) of sample playback sounds nicest when I use these objects:

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3c54762d20bb4692326a9f42f21bd1873e946dd4.jpg&quot; width=&quot;553&quot; height=&quot;337&quot;&gt;

It seems much more subtle and useable than when using the FM inlet of sss/table/samplePlayer for example. I have to tune the phazorFM object to -64 to hear the whole sample though and it loops all the time. I could add a vca and an envolope that gets shorter when pitch gets higher, but it would be difficult and I&#39;d still have to add phase reset somehow.

I think better would be to make it only play one cycle when triggered - how would I go about this? Maybe @SirSickSik can help? 

K-rate code:
&gt;  uint32_t freq;
   MTOFEXTENDED(param_pitch + inlet_pitch,freq);

[This thread](http://community.axoloti.com/t/mtofextended-function/1732/2) suggests that this has something to with pitch correlated phase increments (whatever that is).

S-rate code:
&gt; int32_t FM=___SMMUL(inlet _freq&lt;&lt;3,freq&lt;&lt;4);
FM=___SMMUL(FM&lt;&lt;3,inlet _FMW&lt;&lt;2);
Phase += freq + FM;
   outlet_phasor = Phase&gt;&gt;5;

[I had to add a blanks between &quot;inlet&quot; and &quot;_&quot; as it wouldn&#39;t show correctly otherwise]

So as far as I understand (and [this thread](http://community.axoloti.com/t/coding-axoloti-objects/2606/1) explained a bit) it does the ___SMMUL [or x*y/(2^32)] thing twice with bit-shifted values to get the FM going and attenuate it with the FMW inlet and then adds the FM value to &quot;freq&quot;. Does &quot;freq&quot; rise linearly because of the k-rate code? Can I just set Phase = 0 with &quot;if&quot; on a rising edge of a boolean inlet to reset the phase? And what is the maximum value, so I can make it stop after reaching that? 

Thanks for any advice!</description>

              <p>I managed to get achieve what I wanted by merging <a class="mention" href="/u/jfcharles">@jfcharles</a>' one peroid phasor object and <a class="mention" href="/u/sirsicksik">@SirSickSik</a>'s phazorFm object into one and telling it to set the phase of the FM'd phasor to zero when the other ones is at zero as well. I still don't get most of what these objects are doing, but it seems to work. Might be interesting if you're looking for FM on one shot samples, I use it together with "table/read interp". Here's the object:<br><a class="attachment" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b1d1bd0ad210f7272608b617b48d7f03207f1788.axo">phazorFM1shot.axo</a> (1.6 KB)</p>

<p>This is what it puts out. It looks a bit different every time triggered and I get these spikes (which are put out by the original phazorFM object as well) - probably these are actually negative values, I wonder if I could flip them.</p>

              <p>I managed to find a phasor object that plays just one cycle <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/triggered-phasor-playing-just-one-period/3931">here</a> and tried to edit in the code of the phazorFM object. Unfortunately now the FM doesn't work anymore. Here's what I did:</p>

<p>K-rate code:</p>

<blockquote><p>uint32_t freq;<br>   MTOFEXTENDED(param_pitch + inlet_pitch,freq);<br>if ((inlet_trig&gt;0) &amp;&amp; !triggered) {<br>   triggered = 1;<br>   first = 1;<br>} else if (!(inlet_trig&gt;0)) {<br>   triggered = 0;<br>}</p></blockquote>

<p>S-rate code:</p>

<blockquote><p>int32_t FM=___SMMUL(inlet _freq&lt;&lt;3,freq&lt;&lt;4);<br>	FM=___SMMUL(FM&lt;&lt;3,inlet _FMW&lt;&lt;2);<br>if (first &gt; 0) {<br>	phase += freq + FM;<br>     first = 0;<br>     } else if (phase + freq &lt; freq) { // almost over<br>	phase = 0;<br>	} else if (phase == 0) { // over<br>	//phase = 0; redundant<br>	} else { // normal<br>     phase += freq + FM;<br>     //r = 0; redundant<br>     } outlet_phasor = phase&gt;&gt;5;</p></blockquote>

<p>I guess adding the FM value messes with the way of detecting the end of the cycle, but I have no idea how to solve that.</p>
