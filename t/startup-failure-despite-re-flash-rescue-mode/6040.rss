    <description>me again,
everything was working fine for the last 10 days and i was making some good progress. today i somehow &quot;bricked&quot; one of my voice axolotis again, going into the &quot;blinking then black&quot; mode that i had before.

now, last time i just started up once with S2 being held, reflashed my patch and it was back to normal. not this time. i can boot in S2 empty mode, acces the axoloti as usual via USB, run my patch, upload as startup, upload to flash. all good. but after a reboot it still goes black again. so i tried DFU rescue mode, succesfully reflashed in there, but that didnt help either.

so next step, instead of my proper patch i just re-flashed a simple oscillator and boom it works fine. reboots into the OSC. so something is wrong with my patch? the same exact patch boots perfectly fine on the other two voice boards. and it also runs fine if i just go live after an S2 boot cycle. that last part proves my patch is just fine right? di my flash memory possibly get damaged partially so it cant fit bigger patches anymore? or could it be an sd-card issue?</description>

              <p>You probably know it but just in case, sometimes hardclipping or resonant filter with peak full on make your patch not working in a non-stable way, I mean everything seems to be ok, but suddenly the patch is overflowed or the CPU is saturated because of this. Did you take care about that too ?</p>

<p>Hope You'll be fine and find a solution soon.</p>

              <p>haha damn the magic unsolved mysteries of axoloti...</p>

<p>i actually just tried deleting one line of code, pasting it somewhere else and recompiling. no luck so far though</p>

<p>fwiw this patch also started behaving weird when i change the inlet/outlet/attributes of objects in the subpatch, ie. it won't update the GUI to reflect the changes until i restart axoloti/reload the patch. i think this started around the time i started working with objects that have more than one table objref attribute...?</p>
