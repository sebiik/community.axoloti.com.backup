        <p>(Pie in the Sky alert - manage expectations may never happen!!!)</p>

<p><strong>note: this is only for very advanced users/developers... as you will need to respect quite alot of 'unwritten rules' to do with parameters etc ... almost certainly you would need to know the Axoloti code base reasonably well</strong></p>

<p>I was thinking last night, about some new objects that Id like to create,<br>but I realised quite quickly there were quite alot of parameters, and the current way to display parameters would just make the thing unbearable to use.</p>

<p>Now.. we already know we want to have more customisation options, and also presentation options. Which would be cool, and for many users very useful and enough.</p>

<p>BUT it will still have a fundamental limitation, that it will be limited by UI types defined in the axoloti java UI.</p>

<p>so i was wondering how about allowing objects to use custom java classes?</p>

<p>i.e. not only do you ship an axo, but also as jar which contains a java class that has custom java code.<br>Initially I thought about just for displaying the object, but later realised it could potentially also have custom generating code...  (assuming we can get the 'right interface')</p>

<p>It seems not too tricky to actually implement:<br>objects have a class reference, and a jar reference, when the object is created the relevant class its loaded.<br>if its doesn't have a class reference the current implementation is used.</p>

<p>Note: Id considered a custom class loader and embedding the class into the axo file, but this could make the axo file pretty unwieldy</p>

<p>it will mean ensuring the entry points for display etc, are well defined (if its not already true) , but thats no bad thing </p>

<p>of course, there could be issues with versioning etc... but given the small number of users using this, i think its manageable.</p>

<p>What do you think? is custom java code a really bad direction?</p>

        <p>Hm. This would provide a lot of flexibility, of course.</p>

<p>I don't think it's a bad direction. But TBH, I think a way to layout parameters on the "surface" of .axo/.axs's is better. Basically just allow specifing X/Y coordinates for the buttons, maybe grouping and labelling somehow.</p>

<p>Of course, maybe the way to do it would be to allow custom Java code for objects and then use that to provide a layout mechanism!</p>

<p>Just remember that not everyone who wants to make complicated patches also want to write Java code <img src="../../images/emoji/emoji_one/smilea4f0.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> but I think it's fair to say that everyone who makes complicated patches want better layout options.</p>

        <p>Or javascript, that avoids depending on a JDK install.<br>I've been thinking about javascript axoloti objects that can parse arguments and emit the effective axoloti object.<br>That would allow to de-duplicate "mix n", "mux n" objects. So "n" becomes a true object creation argument.<br>But that is more or less independent from custom UI presentation topic.</p>

<p>On the topic of custom object UI's:<br>We need to be careful what api we bind it to. java.awt.Graphics2D is perhaps too low level, maybe SVG is more suitable?<br>I think explicit X/Y coordinates is the future, rather than layout constraints. Pixel-exact representation on all platforms is a design goal.<br>Scalability is important, but not really easy. Some widgets like "sel/sel b 16" will look ugly if the grid lines are not on pixel boundaries. So I think all X/Y locations should be on a integer-pixel grid, and then we can scale the integer-pixel grid.<br>For example, if the 1:1 view grid is 8x8 pixels we can have a first zoom in step at 112.5% where the grid becomes 9x9 pixels, or zoom out to 87.5% where the grid is 7x7 pixels.</p>

        <p>As I mentioned in another thread, the ability to specify basic layout properties like alignment for parameters would probably be enough for most purposes.</p>

<p>Allowing for pixel-based positioning would probably not be that useful, and would make scaling/zooming the patcher window more complicated to implement.</p>

<p>Allowing for the creation of arbitrary interface elements by 3rd-party developers runs the risk of making the Patcher look messy and incoherent, in my opinion.</p>

<blockquote><p>Or javascript, that avoids depending on a JDK install.I've been thinking about javascript axoloti objects that can parse arguments and emit the effective axoloti object.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>That would be great! I think a lot of people would find the ability to use JS to, for example, implement complex logic without having to use a huge number of individual objects really useful. I know I would.</p>

<p>This would be most useful if, rather than a standard Axo object being created from the Javascript, the JS code remained editable, and is simply compiled into C when the patch goes live.</p>

<p>It loses it's utility if you'd have to dive into C/XML to make any subsequent edits to a standard Axoloti object created from the JavaScript definition.</p>

        <p>While Java/Javascript per object is obviously powerful (An aside: if there must be a fourth language involved in making modules, how about Lua instead? Very lightweight, very easy to bind, very easy to learn, the perfect domain specific language IMO)</p>

<p>For custom object layouts I think Java/JavaScript/some-other-language is a language too far, at least if it becomes a requirement for such a basic thing as placement of controls on modules. XML, C and assembly is fine - more than that, and the learning curve becomes steeper and the development process becomes harder and more error prone, </p>

<p>I'd prefer see the development time spent on core functionality and bug-fixing rather than introducing something which will undoubtedly be a lot of additional work with little gain for a development team with plenty on the plate already (if we're only talking about presenting modules better).</p>

<p>An explicit X/Y placement of module components sounds about right to me. That could presumably just be some additional attributes to the existing XML(?)</p>

<p>Just my 2c.</p>

        <p>There are a number of different things here... </p>

<p>As I said, this is not a replacement for customized placement, and it's different from object creation. <br>This is about more advanced UIs , eg say a graph object the user could interact with, or multiple UI elements that work together.  </p>

<p>Eg more how you create panels, with user interaction. </p>

<p>Why Java?  because that's what we already use ... do can directly communicate with existing classes , i.e. No extra layers, interpreters needed <br>It's simple <img src="../../images/emoji/emoji_one/smilea4f0.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>of course , as I said too ... I have a particular requirement for a 'project' of mine, which currently to fulfill , I'd have to either take a private branch , or move outside the axoloti framework - neither are appealing... But of course possible.</p>
