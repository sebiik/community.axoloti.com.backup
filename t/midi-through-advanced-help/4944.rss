    <description>Hello!

Well I&#39;ve had a great time working on my midi note jumbling Axoloti! Now it&#39;s time to connect it into my synth rack!

What I&#39;d really like to do is take note and gate signals from midi channel 1, run them through my patch, then output the changed signals on channel 1, while also forwarding along all the other channels and clock info un-changed... 

Is this possible? I&#39;ve seen one midi through object, but I didn&#39;t really understand how it would work, especially not as a PARTIAL midi through...</description>

              <p>Default patch channel is 1, but you can change that in the patch settings (View -&gt; Settings).</p>

<p>If you place the <strong>midi/in/keyb</strong> in a monophonic subpatch, you change the midi channel of that subpatch. So you can have multiple subpatches, each listening to their own assigned MIDI channel.</p>

              <p>Yikes! that sounds a bit scary!</p>

<p>you know midi/in/keyb - what channel does that look at? Just channel one?</p>

              <p>This should be possible, but you'll have to write your own custom object for that. The help file of the <strong>midi/in/script</strong> object and the MIDI code from the Axoloti firmware can be a good starting point for that.</p>
