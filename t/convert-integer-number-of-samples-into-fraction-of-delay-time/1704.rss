    <title>Convert integer number of samples into fraction of delay time</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/convert-integer-number-of-samples-into-fraction-of-delay-time/1704</link>
    <description>I feel really stupid, there must be a way to do this but I can&#39;t work it out.

I&#39;ve got a timer measuring the interval between presses, this is giving me the number of k-rate samples*. I can multiply it by 16 to get the number of s-rate samples and I have the length of a delay defined as a constant elsewhere. I know what I would do to get the fraction of the total delay time if I was working with floating point, but I can&#39;t work out how to do it using axoloti&#39;s units. I need something like (64/totaldelay)*interval, but axoloti&#39;s options are somewhat limited when it comes to division.

*There&#39;s a deliberate exploitation of execution order there by the way, I have that or gate acting as a 1 k-sample delay, so the button press actually stops the timer and then the gate starts it again 1 k-sample later.
I think I should be adding 1 to the resulting count to compensate, is that right?</description>

<p>EDIT: Seemingly the same result both ways round. It's not a problem, I just put my delay control signal through a min object that's comparing to a constant of 63.99.</p>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> I have a question regarding delays which doesn't seem worth making a new thread for. When the delay time of a given delay is set to 64.00, instead of getting the maximum delay time it seems to give the same effect as 0.00 - i.e. no delay. I assume this is deliberate, but what is the purpose of it? Is it simply the read index lagging so far behind the write index that it bumps into it again?</p>

              <p>But how do I convert my large integer into a fractional value? I feel like I'm missing something here, like perhaps you're assuming something that should be obvious but isn't (to me) for whatever reason.</p>

<p>So what I currently have is a way of measuring the time interval in k-rate samples - output as an integer. I also have an integer constant storing the number of samples that make up the delay buffer. I can divide that by 16 or multiply the interval by 16 to get them in the same range.</p>

<p>Is there really no way to do this properly with the factory objects (which is what I gather from your post)? Given that the buffer size is a nice power of 2, it seems like the  maths wouldn't be too nasty. 524288 is 8192*64, so (interval/8192)=fractional number in the range of 0.00 to 64.00 rounded to whatever the precision of a fractional number is internally.</p>
