    <title>Question about Eurorack levels and Axoloti</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/question-about-eurorack-levels-and-axoloti/6391</link>
    <description>Hey :) 

I just got myself my first Eurorack and I want to use Axoloti as an effect unit.

I know Eurorack levels are much higher than normal level, so I was wondering if I could damage my Axolotis input by connecting a eurorack module directly to Axolotis input?

Just thought I&#39;d ask before trying, to make sure I don&#39;t break anything :)</description>

<p>Yeah, I have always been a fan of thinking creatively and/or finding good chap options for things. But for low end weight, I just could not get what I wanted from either Axoloti, Organelle, Nord G2 or Blofeld. </p>

<p>But I think this modules has pretty punchy/weighty sound. It also offers a 3 band eq as well as a compressor. So it can really do pretty much everything in the box <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Has presets too, so there is total recall on the module <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I have been having a lot of fun avoiding my main setup of late with just an axo; the digitakt and a Shruthi all in a briefcase, the axo gets used for polyphony or timestretch/glitched mangling in my head the pair equal an octatrack, as it has always tempted me, having had both which of them did you prefer, while obviously not preferring either?</p>

              <p>I think level as something to do with it. But there could be many reason to why it sounds better, D/A converter, variable types, etc., it's really hard to tell what does the big difference.</p>

<p>I just think that Axoloti is not that well suited for bassy sounds, like bass, kick drums etc. So I thought I'd get something with more kick to it, no pun intended <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> </p>

<p>I did have a Digitakt at some point, yes, but I sold it again pretty fast. Also had an Octatrack before that, which I also sold again. They were cool, but just not what I was looking for, I wanted something that also had a sound engine, not only sampling. And this has both, so for now I am pretty content <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Cool, both digital modules with an axo flavour, do you think it's the level they put out that gives them the punch? </p>

<p>Just watched a couple of Demo's they both sound awesome (Gantz Graf in no time), am I misremembering or did you have a digitakt at one point (my particular source of glitch), how does that compare in terms of thump to the modules?</p>

<p>Anyways keep us posted, have always been tempted myself</p>

<p>Ahh thank you for the tip. Sometimes it can be hard to find what you are looking for in here <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  </p>

<blockquote><p>so you have gone to the darkside, what tempted you in?</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>I always felt like the sounds I made the basics, like kick/bass/drums sound a bit thin when made it with G2 or Axoloti or Organelle or Blofeld. And most Eurorack stuff I have heard is very punchy, so I thought I'd get a rack so I can customise a bit more for those sounds and then use Axoloti for other stuff like effects and so on.</p>

<p>I only got 2 modules for now, a Vpme Quad drum module, which I am extremely happy with.</p>

<p>And then I have a 2Hp Freez. </p>

<p>A good combo for making glitchy stuff <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>And most of my friends has racks, builds modules and so on, so it was pretty natural to get one at some point <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
