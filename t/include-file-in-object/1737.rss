    <title>Include File in Object</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/include-file-in-object/1737</link>
    <description>Another stupid noob question, I&#39;m afraid.

I have a load of data tables stored as constant arrays, and I&#39;d like dump them into an external file and include them in several custom objects I&#39;m working on.

I&#39;ve tried adding a reference to the file in the &lt;includes&gt;[relative path]&lt;/includes&gt; section of the objects XML, but this doesn&#39;t seem to work, sadly.

I can tell the file is being brought in when the object is compiled, as if I also define any of the same constants in Local Data section of the XML of the object itself, I get an error about the redefinition.

However, I can&#39;t seem to access the data in the included file from my code in the K-Rate Code section of my object code. I get no error in the console, but every request for data from the included file returns zero.

I suspect this is a scope issue, but there must be a way to get it to work.

Incidentally, I don&#39;t seem to be able to enter any text in the Includes (or Dependencies) field in the Overview tab of the Object Editor. Is this a known issue?

              <p>I had trouble with this at first, then I noticed that you also need to populate the helpPatch field, otherwise the editor clears the include tag from the xml when loading:</p>

<p></p><pre><code class="lang-auto">   &lt;helpPatch&gt;myheader.axh&lt;/helpPatch&gt;
   ...

<p>(same name as your header file but with .axh extension)<br>The header file is located in the same directory as the .axo file.</p>

              <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="/u/toneburst">@toneburst</a></p>

<p>Was wondering if you would show me how you include the headerfile in the Axo object?</p>

<p>I tried this:<br>- I put the headerfile, called "functions.h", that I created in Xcode, into the same folder as the axo object, in this case called "sum.axo". I included the headerfile using include, as shown on the picture:</p>

<p>But when I try to go live I get this error:<br><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/0496bb9e609e915418ebc0d3fdaf60fd44b6bbf6" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0496bb9e609e915418ebc0d3fdaf60fd44b6bbf6.png" class="lightbox" title="Screen Shot 2019-10-22 at 00.31.22.png"><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/0496bb9e609e915418ebc0d3fdaf60fd44b6bbf6_1_690x79.png" width="690" height="79"><div class="meta">

<p>Can you tell me what I am doing wrong here? </p>

<p>The header file has to be in the same folder as the object, right?</p>

              <p>I've discovered that I can just dump the whole of my .c file into the header file, and declare and assign values to my constant arrays there, without the need for the .c file at all.</p>

<p>I don't think this is how header files are supposed to be used, though. My understanding is that you're supposed to declare variables in the header, but not assign them, and you're actually supposed to assign values to them in a .c file that's included by the header.</p>

<p>Here's a cut-down version of what's in my header file, included by my object:</p>

<pre><code>#ifndef CANTO_TABLES_H
	
	#define CANTO_TABLES_H

	// All audible phonemes (73)
	const int8_t phonemes[] = {
		5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,
		21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,
		37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,
		53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,
		69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,	
	};

#endif</code></pre>

<p>It seems to work fine like this.</p>

<p>However, having read a little about the evils of global variables in the past (and I understand declaring a variable as 'extern' makes it global), I have a feeling this is the wrong way to do thing.</p>

<p>I have two goals in putting the the tables in an external file:</p>

<ol>
<li>So that I can use them in multiple objects</li>
<li>So that if I do the above, the same variables will not be declared multiple times, if I use more than one instance of the objects that use the external file.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't know if this method fulfils either of these criteria.</p>

<p>Incidentally, if I can do the same thing with a single, rather than 2 files, that might be cool.</p>

<p>Any advice gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>Global variables seem to be used all the time in Factory objects, but I'm not sure they are actually global. Maybe their scope is limited in some way.</p>
