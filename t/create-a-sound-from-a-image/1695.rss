    <title>Create a sound from a image?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/create-a-sound-from-a-image/1695</link>
    <description>Did anybody thought about a solution to create a sound from image data? I think the idea is quite interesting. A image has less data than a sample. I saw some imagesynths in the web and tried some. I think the most solutions were not very successful, but the idea behind is not bad, depending on the implementation.</description>

<p>I think that might be a bit ambitious, since these Reaktor synths are quite processor-intensive, even on a desktop machine.</p>

<p>The other issue with additive-type synthesis is actually coming up with some useable way to control all those sine waves. While it's relatively easy, technically, to generate a load of waves, it's much more difficult, UI-wise, to come up with a way to sculpt these into something interesting.</p>

<p>Razor's fancy 3D graphics help a lot with that, but obviously, that's not an option with Axoloti.</p>

<p>The ANS synthesizer is a photoelectronic musical instrument created by Russian engineer Evgeny Murzin from 1937 to 1957. The technological basis of his invention was the method of graphical sound recording used in cinematography (developed in Russia concurrently with USA), which made it possible to obtain a visible image of a sound wave, as well as to realize the opposite goalâ€”synthesizing a sound from an artificially drawn sound spectrogram. In this case the sine waves generated by the ANS are p...</p>

              <p>The wave/play objects just read raw data, so if you would put some images on the SD card you can just play them as if they were audio. You should expect a lot of noise though when playing files like this. Works with any kind of binary file, so Excel and PowerPoint files do a fine job as well.</p>

<p>I'm not sure the Axoloti is powerful enough to do this usefully.</p>

<p>I think a Raspberry Pi would do the job better, and you could also use the RPI camera module to snap images to resynthesise.</p>
