    <title>Question about patch efficiency with object duplicating</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/question-about-patch-efficiency-with-object-duplicating/2702</link>
    <description>Note the subject doesn&#39;t quite describe my question well.
Lets for example I connect a switch to PB0 as GPIO digital input.
I then have the object in the patch to output the digital high or low, and to keep it simple is connected to 3 objects with input triggers of any sorts, the question of interest is as follows..
There are 2 options here..
1. Patch cords can be added from the GPIO Input object to each of the 3 input triggers.
2. The GPIO input with PB0 object can be duplicated 3 times and connected singularly to each object and because they all are connected to PB0, they will all have the same output.

As I see benefits to both options depending on the needs, but noting option 2 specifically, what I am interested to know is, does this affect the patch efficiency ?

My current testing does not appear to have caused issues yet but they are only in small scale, so I am looking to &#39;up&#39; this technique considerably, especially for detailed subpatches.

So want to know if I am barking up the wrong tree here.

Thanks

              <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> <br>I get it now, so it will all happen in the order in which the objects are placed in the patch which as you state will be executed at different times. There are quite few objects that can be used this way, it could actually provide some interesting outcomes for some sort of dirty data perspective. Make it look a little less robotic maybe. Something to play with.</p>

              <p>Separate GPIO digital input objects will measure the GPIO separately - when their code is executed - and can produce a different behavior when the input is changing. For example, when decoding an incremental encoder, you'd want to use a single GPIO digital input object for each input for consistent results. <br>In terms of patch performance or memory size, I expect the difference to be very small.</p>
