    <title>Big issue to install the soft and the drivers</title>

    <description>Hi,
I received my axoloti a few days ago, and I can&#39;t use it :
I&#39;ve a windows 7 64bits :  I&#39;ve read all the guide, I first began to install the latest version 1.0.8, I put the runtime on my programme(x86) and installed the msi, and I get the winusbcompact to install the drivers. Iv&#39;e already dll the latest version of Java. 
This time axoloti Patcher didn&#39;t recognize the Axoloti Core, so I could patch but without listening my result (no button live )

after that I uninstall all the things, put the 1.0.6 version, the run-time for the 1.0.6 version, install already the drivers, but Axoloti patcher don&#39;t load on my desk. When I click on it it appear on the  task manager in process but not in applications.


I spent 2 hours to install, uninstall, try other versions, and finally nothing work fine, so if somebody can help me, because I think I&#39;m going to be crazy.</description>

              <p>Thanks, now the Patcher work fine !</p>

<p> There was the redondant issue of : </p>

<p>No available USB device found with matching PID/VID<br>search path : objects<br>finished loading objects</p>

<p>I made every thing to correct it like it was written in the topic ; <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/win-7-no-usb-found-with-matching-pid-vid/117/31">http://community.axoloti.com/t/win-7-no-usb-found-with-matching-pid-vid/117/31</a> </p>

<p>and the only thing which work fine is to connect the usb in an other port, so it's great !</p>

<p>Thanks to you, I fight against a Pi2 for six month to make an audio inlet, making something with hardware too with an arduino and make sound, and it was catastrophic ! Your board is a perfect aswer to my projects !</p>

              <p>Can I just add one thing here please, new users please install the release version <strong>not</strong> the TEST version (which is clearly marked on github as a pre-release).</p>

<p>once you are familiar with Axoloti, then of course, we are very grateful for you, helping  us test the pre-releases, but using a test version when your are unfamiliar with the product is not recommended.</p>
