              <p>You're resetting "result" to 0 at each cycle, so if an inlet stops being "1" (or !=0), its value is lost.<br>If you delete the line <code>result = 0;</code>, <code>result</code> will add up; but you need to make sure each button only adds <em>once</em> while pressed. For that you need a variable like  <code>ntrig</code>, which is set to 1 when a button is pressed, and back to 0 when it isn't. Schematically<br><code>if ((inlet_i0!=0)&amp;&amp;(!ntrig)){<br>ntrig = 1;<br>result = result + 0;<br>}<br>else if (inlet_i0==0){<br>ntrig = 0;<br>}</code></p>

<p>If you want to be able to press several puttons at the same time, you need to do this for each inlet, with a different <code>ntrig</code> variable for each inlet. If you know that only one button will be pushed at a time, you can put the whole <code>if (inlet_...</code> block inside the <code>if</code>, i.e. replace <code>inlet_i0</code> in the above with <code>inlet_i1+inlet_i2+...+inlet_i7</code></p>

<p>That is very useful. I already dug out a lot of tutorials on c++ but will leave them for now and find some introduction to C instead. And also the XML I will look into.</p>

              <p>If your not familiar with C++, Id avoid looking at xpatch.cpp.<br>most of the code you need for writing objects will be in C, which is much easier to learn that C++ <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile"> </p>

<p>you should also get a 'passing familiarity' with XML, so you can understand the structure of the axo files.</p>

<p>once you understand a few basics in C/XML, just dive in... look at existing axos, try to figure out how they work, just don't (initially) get hung up on understanding all the code... the start creating a few objects, by taking existing ones as a starting point.</p>

<p>(again, assuming you have read the first few chapters of a book on dsp or similar)</p>

<p>the idea is, in the future, the users will not have to interact with the XML, as the Object Editor will allow parameters/attributes and code all to be entered.</p>

<p>I learnt, by simply looking at existing objects and also the java code, it was not that hard really.</p>

<p>sha/uuid, yeah we need to abstract so this can be called from the command line.<br>basically uuid can be anything, and if you put an sha that is wrong, it will tell you its wrong, and what the correct one is.<br>(so I usually , when I'm not generating from java, copy an existing object, change the uuid and then just load it to get the correct sha)</p>

<p>Johannes answer:<br>C++ books will teach you a lot of things that are<br> hardly relevant for Axoloti. The programming constructs used in the <br>objects are most elementary. The harder part is expressing what you want<br> to do, where the difficulty is not so much in programming but in the <br>math and DSP.<br>If you want to learn about music-dsp, not sure what to recommend. I <br>learned from many different resources over a long time, I don't know <br>where to start.</p>

<p>Mostly interested in programming that is relevant for Axoloti. But from what Johannes wrote, I don't really know where to begin. It would be really great if us "beginners" could help each other with this, but we need a place to start <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile"></p>
