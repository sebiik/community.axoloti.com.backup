    <title>How to set up for legato trills?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/how-to-set-up-for-legato-trills/888</link>
    <description>There is probably a simple solution to this but how can you patch a mono synth so that when you play trills, the pitch alternates between the notes? I mean when I hold F and play G, the G will play, but when I release G, it&#39;s just a note off event, F doesn&#39;t play. Thanks.</description>

The gate doesn't close until I play and release that note. Is there a way around this?</p>

              <p>hmm... i think there might be a few limitations in the standard midi keyb object which might make this tricky</p>

<p>essentially, it only tracks the last note, rather than all notes currently pressed.</p>

<p>I think what we would need is an object which keep tracks of notes, and then decides based upon 'mono mode' which pitches, velocities to output.</p>

<p>e.g. Ive got hw synths  with the following mono modes<br>- high note priority<br>- low note priority<br>- last note<br>and then retrigger variants of these.</p>

<p>there are quite a few possible variations ,  which can be built once you store the active notes and decide what to do when new notes are added, or notes removed.</p>

<p>theoretically you can do this track in your own patch...<br>but I fear we may not be sending through the last note off e..g the G note off in your example, as its not the active note... but id need to check</p>

<p>the other more involved approach would involve a midi script, which could process the midi, and then send notes back via the midisend3 to the internal port...</p>

<p>but might we need to find a better solution within midi keyb, or the patcher (mono)</p>
