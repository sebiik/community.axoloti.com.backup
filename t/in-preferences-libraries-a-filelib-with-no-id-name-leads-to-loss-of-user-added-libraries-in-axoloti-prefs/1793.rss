Axoloti Patcher, Developer Build, 1.0.10-15-ge4b6308
Build Date: 19/05/2016 22:15:34 EDT

Hi!  I believe I can replicate this:

Use File-&gt;Preferences...-&gt;Libraries, then &quot;+&quot; to add a local library, **but don&#39;t fill in an Id**.  
At this point, the software struct in mem works fine during that session.  Patches using objects in the Libraries are loaded.  And axoloti.prefs reflects the added libraries.  Verified after quitting.  (Id element in .prefs file looks like &lt;Id&gt;&lt;/Id&gt;).

Then restart Axoloti Patcher.  
Select File-&gt;Preferences... again and look at the Libraries list.  
You may see that the data structure in software is blank except for stock paths: factory, home, community.  The user paths don&#39;t load properly anymore.  (and clearly patches requiring these won&#39;t load).  And this is extra evil because when you exit, this empty version gets saved in the axoloti.prefs!  

If on the other hand, you **make a lib with an Id** my paths don&#39;t get wiped out.

Also note that the same field has two differing names &quot;Id&quot; and &quot;Name&quot;.  

Symptoms: 
1. Patches using user objects in the Libraries path don&#39;t load properly.  (&quot;But I added that filelib two times again and it ran, but not when I reloaded!&quot;)  

2. Preferences/Libraries only has three stock locations (factory, home, community).

3. axoloti.prefs file doesn&#39;t include &lt;flielibs&gt; relating to user-added libraries.


Workaround: Fill in the &quot;Id&quot; field when adding a file to your libraries path.


BTW axoloti fooking rocks.</description>
