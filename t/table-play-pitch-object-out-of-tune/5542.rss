    <title>Table/play pitch object out of tune?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/table-play-pitch-object-out-of-tune/5542</link>
    <description>Hello,
I&#39;m having a problem with the table/play pitch object. It plays the samples slightly out of tune. In order to make sure I made some new samples with sine waves on C3 and C4.
These samples read 130 and 261 Hz on the audio analyzer on audacity, but when I play them on the &quot;table/play pitch&quot; object they are at 126 and 255 Hz. 
This might not seem too big of a problem but playing it with other tuned stuff you can really tell it is out of tune.
I have tweaked the pitch knob on the object and that is the closest I get to the original frequency.
Does anyone have any idea on what can I be doing wrong?
Here&#39;s a screenshot of the patch and subpatch I&#39;m using, I&#39;m trying to keep it as simple as I can trying to avoid mistakes.

EDIT: Samples are in .raw format, exported with Audacity as RAW (header-less) Signed 16-bit PCM</description>

              <p>WOW ok, it was that, I had the samples at 44100 hz instead of 48000, I have just tried and I seem to be getting the frequency right :)))<br>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/lokki">@lokki</a>!!!!</p>
