    <title>Alternating between operating systems</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/alternating-between-operating-systems/3768</link>
    <description>Hi all,
I have a mac at home and a windows 7 laptop in my studio, both have the axo software installed. I haven&#39;t used the windows machine for axo action yet because the internet in my studio is down but today was thinking about it and was wondering if I should expect software issues when switching between them, i.e. connecting my axo core to either of them, using the same SD card. Does anybody know?

thanks!</description>

              <p>no issues - you can freely swap between windows/mac <br>just make sure you are using the same version of axoloti on both machines (1.0.12) </p>

<p>(iirc, there was a slight issue in previous versions of axoloti where the axoloti firmware would ask to be upgrade each time you moved between OS - not a problem, just a pain -  but I'm pretty sure that was fixed in 1.0.12)</p>
