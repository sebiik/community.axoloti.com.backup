    <description>Hi all,
I am a little stumped...
This is the first time I have completed a patch from my own imagination that will have some kind of use to me, but was also a challenge to get use to the methods involved with the objects etc..
It uses the timeri object and counts the timeri bits during 15 cycles of the given wave.
And to get around the additional harmonics appearing of the given frequency, I just added simple math to double the value till it gets back to within the range of the 1st harmonic, which also allows for higher octaves also to be picked up.

This is not so much showing what I have done, but am also looking at where to go.
I have already started a Chromatic version, but there seams too  much happening, and I am feeling rather jumbled about where to start in terms of making it easier to view.

What I really want is an integer bar showing what note I am closest to, and a second set showing how close to the tuning I am. So I can&#39;t quite visualize it yet, into what I have already done, any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.. screen dump of the patch also..
