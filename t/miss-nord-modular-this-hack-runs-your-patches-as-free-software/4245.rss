    <title>Miss Nord Modular? This hack runs your patches as free software</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/miss-nord-modular-this-hack-runs-your-patches-as-free-software/4245</link>
    <description>Saw this link. Sounds interesting. Basically converts Nord modular patches to Csound and makes the Nord Modular GUI useful for controlling Csound.

http://cdm.link/2018/02/nord-modular-free-software/

It&#39;s open source. Wonder how hard it would be to adapt this software to convert NM patches to axoloti?

              <p>I realise this may not be what you are driving at, but it is easier to browse while being away from your axo and may stir some ideas </p>

<p>to respond to your actual enquiry, I am sure there is a lot of crossover in the basic factory objects and Nord modules, but it will be rare to find an exact port of them, the exception being toneburst/pattern/nmpgen3 which is a clone of the nord modular pattern generator, and a hell of a lot of fun.....</p>

<p>If you are just browsing and don't have a specific idea in mind that you want to implement, I often find it helpful myself trawling the communinty help patches and then the contributions thread ( <a href="//community.axoloti.com/c/community-library">http://community.axoloti.com/c/community-library</a> ) to see what people have uploaded on a contributor basis, found a few hidden gems that way, that I don't think I would have come across by merely searching.....these allow the contributor  the chance to fully explain an object, where the object browser may just be a few lines, you may find that objects are uploaded to be used together or with a specific patch in mind...just more information in general.</p>

<p>Hope that is of some use</p>

              <p>Sorry for awakening this old thread. I have a question that relates to the discussion in this thread regarding NM G2 &amp; Axoloti. </p>

<p>I'm trying to find any info on how many (if any) and if so, which of the modules in the NM G2 that have inspired any similar modules in the Axoloti editor?</p>

<p>I'm not looking for finding them being exact replicas (aka reverse engineered) in sound as I'm not expecting (not even wanting) that. But I'm trying try to get to a point of understanding what I'm even looking at when it comes to certain Axoloti modules. Many modules have quite confusing 'names' that of course relates to their intended functionality. And I feel overwhelmed at any time trying to figure what each one offers. Which of course is due to my attempts of understanding, if there are any similarities to the modules I'm more familiar with in the NM G2.</p>

<p>Is there some kind of a list to read of the Axoloti modules and their features/functionalities?<br>Or any possibilities to extract such information out of the Axoloti editor?</p>

<p>They didn’t, but there is a 3rd-party script to do that.</p>

<p>I have both an original Nord Modular keyboard, and a G2 Engine, but to be honest, never tried converting an NM1 patch to G2 format and comparing, so can’t comment on how close they sound.</p>

              <p>The NM patch files are all text files so parsing them to something that may run on a Axo is not impossible, but would be a ton of work. For the CSound version, I imagine they found a way yo convert the parameters given for the Nord modules and applied them to similar (but not exact) modules in the CSound complement. The same would have to happen in the Axo world to make this work. Somebody would hace to create all the modules that are in a Nord Modular, with the same In's and Out's and knobs and controls, and then just re-direct the NM's patch commands to apply to those modules. They of course would not sound the same, but would function similarly. </p>

<p>The patch file names the modules used and the knob positions and the cables connections and more. A Nord Modular (NM1) patch file looks like this:</p>

<p>That's really what I was wondering about. I've never had a Nord Modular, but I know there's a ton of patches still out there. Sometimes cracking the proprietary format is the hard part, sounds like in this case, not so much.</p>

<p>Emulating all NM modules sounds a bit much too. Anyway, just something I saw and thought worth noting.</p>

<p>well axoloti is not going to run csound... without a lot of work.<br>so that means this converter would have to be written to map everything to axoloti objects/connections, which basically is most of the work involved in doing this from scratch. <br>(all you basically get from this project is something which can parse a NM2 file)</p>

<p>that said, not an impossible task.. just lots of dev work.</p>

<p>note: Ive seen quite a few saying how great this is... but if you read the docs at the developers site, he clearly states there are quite a few 'NM2' objects missing... so as it stands  (and it been around quiet a while... its only new to CDM <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ) , its not going to covert every NM2 patch.</p>
