    <description>Is it possible to include different files at compile-time based on the value set in an attribute? If so, how?

              <p>Ah, that should work.</p>

<p>Would the compiler ignore constant arrays that weren't actually referenced anywhere?</p>

<p>I ask because they arrays may be quite large...</p>

              <p>It's a(nother) slightly obscure scenario. I'm working on a series of <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/toneburst-contributions/1468/42?u=toneburst">modules</a> based on LPC speech-synthesis. I'd like to include different word libraries, to be played back by the same object, but for various reasons, I'd like to keep them external to the object itself. I thought being able to select one of the available libraries from a combobox before making the patch live might be a way to achieve this, so was investigating possibilities.</p>
