<p>My advice is: Why not build a steam powered analog XP. Following your line of thought the main problem must be that it is digital.</p>

<p>Maybe there is some ancient CCCP atomic test site that would be big enough to house it. Or use the building where they tried to build the Buran, the Russian Spaceshuttle. Google it and be amazed!<img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/joy.png?v=5" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"></p>

<p>Anyway: I am sure Putin wil fund it. Just to make Russia big again.</p>

<p>Speaking of which: Since my theory is that Putin is behind every dark plot on the planet: Is he not already funding you, Axoman?<img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/laughing.png?v=5" title=":laughing:" class="emoji" alt=":laughing:"></p>

<p>OK. You've done it again. You have again turned this thread into a "analogue is best" surmon (I use the ancient spelling intentionally). What are you actually doing in Axoloti land?<img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/confounded.png?v=5" title=":confounded:" class="emoji" alt=":confounded:"></p>

<p>Help, Techno Bear, help!. This guy just can't quit. I'd say this is strike 2!<img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/face_with_raised_eyebrow.png?v=5" title=":face_with_raised_eyebrow:" class="emoji" alt=":face_with_raised_eyebrow:"></p>

<p>By the way:<br>- The Fostex A8 was actually a 1/8 inch reel recorder which made the tracks cassette width because 8 where crammed on it.<br>- OK. So I gather Amstad was UK and not US. Anyway. I never heard of it while going shiny eyed through the period so it must have been a total no go in my neck of the woods (Netherlands).<br>- The rest of the tale reminds me of how Phillips threw it's reputation to pieces by building chep plasticy stuff in a bid to guard of the Japanese. Luckily they more or vindicated themselves by being one of the companies behind the CD, which was DIGITAL! <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
