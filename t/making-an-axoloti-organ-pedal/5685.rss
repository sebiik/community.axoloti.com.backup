    <title>Making an Axoloti Organ Pedal</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/making-an-axoloti-organ-pedal/5685</link>
    <description>So I have this old bass pedal (13 notes) from an old ORLA Organ that I want to turn into my own personalized MOOG Taurus. 

There are guides on how to DIY with Arduino or even Raspberry Pi but none for Axoloti and I&#39;d like to keep my purchase list neat and tidy going into this. 

Any advice on what I&#39;d need to buy? 

In order to make it velocity sensitive, what would I need to pull of? Anyone have any ideas on where to fetch what that would go well with this? 
I&#39;ve seen some try conductivity and Arduino for this purpose, but there might be better ways of going about.</description>

<p>Frankly, I don't use aftertouch/velocity at all on my pedals.    It's mainly a big mono synth dedicated for bass.   When I use them live, I don't fancy on the pedals, I simply "kick" the for that big sustained bass drone.   You can have an idea of the effect watching an old live video of my band here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LERl61htme0" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LERl61htme0</a>  (around 1:30, I stop playing bass and simply depress my midi pedals).</p>

<p>I can see the use for more control with your feet, maybe I'd have to try it!   Maybe on the 5th version of my thingy. <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

              <p>Hi there,</p>

<p>I'm also working on a "Moog Taurus" emulator.   So far, I've got the sound engine covered (maybe 90%).  I'm aiming more for a "guitar pedal" type box.    But I do have a set of old Hammond pedals which is gonna get transformed into a full fledged Moog Taurus one day.</p>

<p>I've been researching Moog Taurus since 2011 and I think I know them pretty good.  (even got the original manual).</p>

<p>I'm at my 4th prototype, my previous attempts were based on Raspberry PIs but the Axoloti Core makes a much more elegant solution in my opinion.</p>

<p>I know it's an old thread, but it you need help or info, don't be shy!</p>

<p>While this doesn't describe what I intend the back to look like and I might want a better powerswitch et.c.</p>

<p>This is more or less the complete primary vision for the project.</p>

<p>It is to emulate the look and execution of most of what one expects from a MOOG Taurus but the Variable is instead replaced with a sample-based library that you can switch in between.</p>

<p>Adding a sub just to have it possible to strike fear into my enemies.</p>

              <p>first thing to do is see if the existing switches support velocity sensing. few of the old pedals actually do this. if unsure you can post a picture of a switch in the pedal...</p>
