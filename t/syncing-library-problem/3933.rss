    <title>Syncing library problem!</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/syncing-library-problem/3933</link>
    <description>Hello!

I was happy to see this morning that SirSickSik and TB had sorted out SSS&#39;s issues with Github, so I happily did a sync library.

But when I hit sync library I got this message:
Status: community (1.0.12,anon)

Nothing happened. I thought it was because Axo for some reason had &quot;forgotten&quot; about my prefix so I entered it again. I havent used it for a while. Now I get a messages that I have never seen before:

I have not touched or uploaded anything for Axoloti in months and last time I used it it worked 100% fine and now I get all these weird message I have newer seen before

@thetechnobear any ideas?</description>

<p>what I might do for the next release is get Axoloti  to report the commit id to the console, this would enable us to see where Axoloti currently thinks the last change is.... i.e. where has it synchronised too.</p>

<p>( I dont want to go and find the 'latest change' on github, as that implies network activity, to go find it, and I want axoloti to not touch the network unless explicitly requested to do so (using Sync, or if you enable autosync.)</p>

<p>anyway, glad you up n running again.</p>

</div></a></div> </p>

<p>also Axoloti is not reporting any errors in the console, so Ive nothing to go on, as it all appears correct.<br>so really Id need to remote log into your machine to see whats doing on, and that really is not worth the effort involved. </p>

<p>as I said... in these cases, do a Reset All, and then re-enter you contrib details - this will force everything to be taken from the cloud, and so ensure you are up to date, and in line with GitHub.</p>

<p>... as for why its changed, again, theres no information for me to go on, all looks fine, and I cant replicate or see any issues here.</p>

<p>First of all wrong user, even though I am logged in with the prefix I showed above "jaffa". Second, it doesnt sync the community library it only syncs factory library. Why could that be?</p>

<p>About the anon issue. It might be related to that long long time ago I had another profile, which was deleted from this forum. And when I entered the forum again, you Marc didnt something so i could keep the jaffa prefix. It has worked fine up to now iirc.</p>

<p>I have just resynced many times and I dobbelt checke that I used the right log in for the com.lib, the same as used for Github and still dont see any new objects from sirsicksik.

<p>well thats where you put these files... so at some point you had your prefix as this.</p>

<p>anyway just delete them if you have no idea what they are <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>dirty = changes are present, that will be committed when you next to sync (but only under your prefix)<br>clean = you have no local changes </p>

<p>anon = anonymous i.e. you are not using an account/prefix , correct for factory... and also for non-contributors for community library.</p>

<p>as i said none of these are errors, they are information...</p>

<p>i see SSS osc/DX7  so if you don't then i suggest you do a reset library... but as far as i can see your library is sync'd correctly (note: its case sensitive)</p>

<p>ideally what I would do if your not sure is, given the time since you last did anything is:<br>move them away , say on your desktop , do a sync , check everything is as expected, and then put them back, and do a sync to upload them.<br>... its not strictly necessary, but if you have been updating on another machine, this will ensure you don't end up creating some kind of conflict due to updates from two places.</p>

              <p>Hello!</p>

<p>I was happy to see this morning that SirSickSik and TB had sorted out SSS's issues with Github, so I happily did a sync library.</p>

<p>But when I hit sync library I got this message:<br>Status: community (1.0.12,anon)</p>

<p>Nothing happened. I thought it was because Axo for some reason had "forgotten" about my prefix so I entered it again. I havent used it for a while. Now I get a messages that I have never seen before:</p>

<p>Axoloti version : 1.0.12-1-0-g4de2b632  build time : 08/02/2017 00:15:42 GMT<br>Link to firmware CRC E95BAC96<br>Status: factory (1.0.12,anon) : OK  ( 1.0.12,clean )<br>Status : home : OK<br>Status: community (1.0.12,jaffasplaffa) : OK  ( 1.0.12,dirty )<br>Changes for: community (1.0.12,jaffasplaffa)<br>untracked: objects/jaffa/dyn/mbext1.axo <br>untracked: patches/sptnk/._rectangular window test patch.axp8292440972423511469.tmp <br>untracked: objects/jaffa/dyn/ng1.axo <br>untracked: objects/jaffa/dyn/compb3.axo <br>untracked: objects/jaffa/dyn/compb2.axo <br>untracked folders: objects/jaffa/dyn <br>Status : Objects : OK<br>Status : Objects2 : OK<br>Status : subs : OK<br>No available USB device found with matching PID/VID<br>search path : /Users/jakobskouborg/Documents/axoloti/axoloti-factory/objects<br>search path : /Users/jakobskouborg/Documents/axoloti/objects<br>search path : /Users/jakobskouborg/Documents/axoloti/axoloti-contrib/objects<br>search path : /Volumes/Jaffa II/1. Music stuff/Axoloti/Axoloti Stuff/Objects/objects</p>

<p>I have not touched or uploaded anything for Axoloti in months and last time I used it it worked 100% fine and now I get all these weird message I have newer seen before</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/thetechnobear">@thetechnobear</a> any ideas?</p>
