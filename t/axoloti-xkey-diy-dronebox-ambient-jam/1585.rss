Hello Axoloti community! Here&#39;s a jam with my very first Axoloti patch! After putting the Core in a drawer after the initial crowdfunding campaign, I always felt that I would need a lot of time for research and stuff, to get going with the device. Yesterday though, I happily learned that this is far from the truth. Apart from the installation instructions, I didn&#39;t read a thing and came up with the following patch just like that in a very short time. This thing is awesome!!!

So, there are two parts to the patch. The first is a general monophonic synthesizer, using several detuned square-wave oscillators sent through stereo low pass filters and stereo delays. The Xkey USB keyboard can play the synth as usual and the keyboard velocity changes LFO speeds and filter cutoffs. The pressure-sensitive pitchbend buttons also open or close another LPF and the pressure-sensitive modwheel button pitches one of the VCOs up really high, for bird-like chirping sounds. Lastly, the Xkey&#39;s sustain button triggers a slowly rising, low-pass filtered white noise &quot;oceanwave&quot; sound.

Playing/controlling all of this creates a very &quot;roomy&quot; and dense ambient soundscape.

The second part of the patch is the audio input processing. This takes a mono audio source and runs it through several slowly modulated flangers, choruses and LPFs and then through the main mixer going into the above stereo effects.

In the video, the DIY Dronebox on the left only plays one constant, deep &quot;C&quot; (I think) note, after I turn it on with the purple pot at 1:21 minutes, and is then mixed and processed with all the rest.
