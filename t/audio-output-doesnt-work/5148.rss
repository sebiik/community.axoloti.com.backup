    <description>hi guys, i got an axoloti a few months ago and i&#39;m finally starting to use it and trying to get to know it. however, i discovered that my left audio output doesn&#39;t work. the patch sends out stereo and both channels are at the same level but it only comes out of the right audio output. anybody had a similar problem ?</description>
