    <title>A worry about the &quot;save patch folder to SD-card&quot; function</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/a-worry-about-the-save-patch-folder-to-sd-card-function/3010</link>
    <description>Hello!

I was just looking through my sd-card for Axoloti, for cleaning. And this time I emptied my trash can, before moving all the automatically created patch folder to the trash, so I could count how many there was. There was more than 1000 empty patch folders! That is a lot. Way to much, IMO. 

I am wondering if it would be possible to implement to be able to set a destination folder for these patch folders in preferences? So a user could just save them to a  folder like &quot;Sd-card/patches/&quot;. And then, when cleaning/maintaining, then just go into &quot;Sd-card/patches/&quot; and delete all the empty folders from there. 

This would really be a lot safer. 

I am very worried that I one day by mistake deletes a folder by mistake which actually contains something that I am using. It is very easy to delete a wrong folder when you have to delete more than 1000 unwanted path folders from the root of the sd-card. They are just messing up the sd-card and making it slower.


I think this is something that should be looked into, so I am bringing it up again. I am also curious about how other people use the patch folders, to get an overview how much they are actually used. To me they are just giving me worries, to be honest.

Thanks, Jaffa</description>
