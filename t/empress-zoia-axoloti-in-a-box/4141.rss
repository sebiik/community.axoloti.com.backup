<p>I think the thing is that with those illuminated pads one instinctively thinks of something like an Ableton Push or Novation Circuit, also the OLED is much smaller than one expects.</p>

              <p>I can describe what I did, but my limited Synth experiences will prevent me to describe what is actually happening, or provide a better way of doing it.. <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>

<p>I don't have access to my patches where I am, I think this is what I did..<br>I applied 3 High Pass filters end to end, with gain on either end. filter 1 &amp; 2 set to maximum, filter 3 set to adjustment for better output, the 2 gains on either end to provide to boost the signal, then change to krate, the signal to be read as a unipolar value, the signal value is then sent through a subtraction object, adjustable with a unipolar dial, the idea here is, the value is only read when it is above zero, so the subtraction is to drive part of the signal below zero.<br>Then only when I pluck the string hard enough will the envelope follower be driven above zero which generates a trigger. All the filters force the signal to drop back to zero very fast.<br>So I have 3 adjustments, filter 3 to fine tune how the signal drives above zero and back to below, the gain after the filter, this helps to adjust the signal when changing filter 3, and most importantly the subtraction value, because this determines how hard you need to pluck to trigger, from supper soft, to really hard.. It works, exactly how, not too sure. Can it be improved, beyond me for now.. <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/confounded.png?v=5" title=":confounded:" class="emoji" alt=":confounded:"></p>

              <p>A system trying to interface between guitar and synth style processing seems to be exactly what I am trying to build myself.<br>After checking searches, I stumbled upon a comment from one people who worked on the project, "I liked Pure data, but I don't like using computers", so exactly what's in the box, who knows..<br>Personally, I don't think its a game changer, but it does provide an interface into the synth world for guitarists. Which was a direction I read many other comments would take.<br>But one thing I have learnt in my own build, this is not so much about applying an effect, or many effects, but more about a complete performance. But this can also be a problem, yes this system will provide sequencing and looping options etc, but for performing guitarists, I don't think this is very desirable. For years guitarists can already have complete backing bands in a box to play along and or perform with, an easy way to earn a few bucks on the side, isn't a system like this just swapping out the backing band for synth style triggering of effects and loops etc.. ?<br>I know above may seem rather convoluted, I do believe that if you are interfacing an instrument, every pluck of the string can provide its own expression, and its extremely important to capture this within whatever system is designed.<br>Sure there is probably plenty of places for some sequencing, lopping and effects etc, when playing your guitar, but to have it naturally change in feel to what you are playing is really the holy grail.<br>One thing I have discovered to do on the Axo, is if I pluck my string harder then normal, it can trigger an event, at the moment its just a simple synth sound through an ADSR, but the concept works. I can also have it trigger a midi drum sound, its fast enough to detect quite fast picking. But the best thing, is I can spontaneously choose to pick soft or hard, trigger or not trigger. <br>Note.. I will make the object to detect a string pluck available soon, but it is very crude, and I am not sure if there is something I am missing.<br><img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/grin.png?v=5" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>

<p>Also the small form factor is good choice I think. I myself end up not using certain hardware live because of limitied space.</p>

<p>this would be cool... and agree i can't see those buttons (nor screen) being useful to a guitarist if its on the floor.</p>

<p>btw, when i was looking at mod duo recently, i also noticed that zynthian are now shipping kits - which is another option for moddep (modduo)  - I think I decided against it for now, as they look like they are going to do a v2, which will support PiSound <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Yes. It is similar to a Mod Duo, but I think this Zoia with the little buttons, is maybe a little less guitar-centric. You can do sequences, oscillators that can be played by a MIDI controller(it seems), and even reproduce sample files. Let's see. As yet, we dont have enough info</p>

              <p>hard to say from that short demo...</p>

<p>but id say , it looks higher level i.e. its has modules that you then can link, rather than build your own modules.  like a (eurorack) modular you buy modules and connect with wires, rather than build your own modules* - in that sense, its probably more similar to /competing with moddevices modduo. (also similar price range) </p>

<p>(* of course, we don't know if they will allow you to build your own modules, and upload.... and how easy that would be)</p>

<p>i do like the interface , but one thing did really strike me, its tiny ... that, or the person doing the demo has huge hands <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> </p>

<p>looks nice though, and a few days back i was wondering about a mod-duo just for a flexible effects box, definitely a place for these things, when i just want to use something, without getting pulled into patching/coding.</p>
