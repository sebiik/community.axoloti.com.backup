    <title>Best electronics socket for connecting external input devices?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/best-electronics-socket-for-connecting-external-input-devices/6114</link>
    <description>Hi all!
New-ish to electronics and very new to DIY electronic instrument construction! I&#39;m designing an axo enclosure currently and I&#39;m thinking I want to take any spare GPIO leftover and connect them to some kind of socket. This would allow me to play around and experiment with different external expressive inputs whilst still having a complete device. for example I&#39;m picturing adding an accelerator/gyro to an existing instrument that is then run through the axo as an effects patch, or attaching an additional light/distance sensor for certain patches etc.

The socket and cable will need to be cheap, easy to connect and wire, and be able to cope with some mechanical movement. A 1/4&quot; TRS obviously works if the GPIO&#39;s are limited to two but I&#39;m hoping to have more than two wires. I was thinking a Cat5 port/cable could work? I could then run a +/- power plus six other connections, but I have never tried anything like this. 

Anyone with more experience than myself out there tried to do something similar? or have any suggestions regarding an appropriate socket and cable combo? Much obliged!</description>

              <p>Hi! Indeed Roland used this 13 PIN/(same as 5 pin MIDI, stereo Hi-Fi..)/DIN connector to plug it into the guitar, which is always in moving, consider a guitarist dancing shaking and jumping on the stage. It has to be pretty sturdy connection without any interruptions occurring during a gig or LIVE concert. (If I'm not wrong this DIN sort of connectors comes for the special demands build with the thread and a nut/bolt on the fem/male, to assure even more permanent and secure connection). Another such a similar connector in constant moving are XLR connectors for the microphones, which are in use for the professional purpose entirely. They are not exceeding the number of PINs I mean more than 5. At the moment I do not have to check my Moog Voyager synth, but there is a cca D25 pin connector on the rear side to connect the entire Moog Synth for this purpose (similar to the VGA connector). In case your idea is to use Axoloti as an USB stick to plug it into your laptop, there are numerous versions including new USB3 specifications, or using the ethernet connector of which the interface is actually part of every personal computer nowadays. Recently the devices based on this interface appeared in the audio professional market as well as Lightshow connections using basicaly DMX protocol with XLR connectors but got extended the advanced projects like Art-net or sACN E1.31 protocols   over CAT5/J45 cables &amp; connectors.   Regards! Oskar</p>

              <p>Thanks for the suggestions, appreciated! </p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/lokki">@lokki</a> I did think about VGA cables but I also felt like they might be too stiff and bulky for as a plug and play instrument cable, I do like the very secure connection tho. Have you tried using them for something similar?</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/weasel79">@weasel79</a> the JST XH look very easy to wire (and cheap) but perhaps a bit flimsy for everyday use, some uses might see the cable moving around a fair bit. If only midi DIN had more than 5 pins, that format would be a good compromise.</p>

              <p>depending on how sturdy you need this to be you could also look into some more solid/bigger pcb-to-wire connectors instead of proper panel-mount jacks. think korg volca modular. something with a securing clip like for example JST XH. will be available in all pin configs, so you could make 8 GPIO pins, 4 SPI, 4 I2C or whatever you think you'll need.</p>
