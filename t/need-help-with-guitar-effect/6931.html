        <p>I don't quite understand what you want to achieve .. your patch looks like some sort of mono tap delay and then a chorus followed by a reverb and a compressor. However it has a really nice sound! I can give you some advice: if you want to use it as an insert effect you have to inject the clean signal somewhere after the delay block, also don't use the smooth object at 64 because it just kills every variation and the five dials connected to the rev are not needed, they are simply a copy of the controls already implemented.<br>And there is another issue: you declare three delay lines dl1, dl1_ and dl1__ , but actually you use only one of them: dl1.</p>

        <p>First of all, thanks so much it sounds way clearer and i can now hear the changing of nobs way better!<br>Maybe this helps to clearly understand what my idea is:<br>Say you were to scream something into a cave or hole( surely we all have at some point <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileae52.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:">) <br>You would get ofc an echo of what you yelled back to you multiple times, but with each return it grows softer and softer.<br>Now lets say the cave yelled back but only once and as loud or maybe louder than you.</p>

<p>That is where i wish to go, that is why i added the Youtube link since -atleast to me- it showed sort of the idea of one person yelling and multiple yelling back a second later.</p>

<p>This is the changed version.<br><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/c278db8ec9b660af88d69f1a7c65d0de0bd0ed19" href="../../uploads/default/original/2X/c/c278db8ec9b660af88d69f1a7c65d0de0bd0ed19.jpg" class="lightbox" title="image.jpg"><img src="../../uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c278db8ec9b660af88d69f1a7c65d0de0bd0ed19_1_690x388.jpg" width="690" height="388"><div class="meta">
<span class="filename">image.jpg</span><span class="informations">1920x1080 416 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>
</div></a></div></p>

<p>Not sure if i really need the compressor since it changes little i feel, same for the multiple delays.<br>And i will need to find a way to make the clean signal sound as soft as possible as i wish to put focus on the response -i tried not making the clear signal come through  but the whole thing sounded to muffled.<br>So maybe i should try working with something that sends my signal 1-2 seconds later than the actual live signal.</p>

        <p>If you put a math / * c object before the mixer "bus in" you can adjust the clean signal .. The compressor is not a bad idea, but sadly it is not well adjusted, it is not your fault, it starts working for threshold &lt;4 and you have to increase the ratio accordingly. You should also put the object drj / audio / out_stereo_vol to compensate for the gain loss of the compressor.</p>
