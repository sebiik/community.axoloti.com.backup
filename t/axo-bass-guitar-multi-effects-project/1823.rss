    <title>Axo Bass Guitar Multi Effects Project</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/axo-bass-guitar-multi-effects-project/1823</link>
    <description>Hi all,
This is my first Axo project I would like to share its progress with you all and happy to receive feedback on ideas etc I may not have thought of yet.
Please note that the journey so far has resulted in a very different outcome to what I thought I was going to do which may have influenced some of my previous posts.

So here goes..

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6f20e4dd3481332866d5befcc832bebd55550ac2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;414&quot;&gt;

It is made up of a generic electronics enclosure, and a Behringer BCN44 &quot;B-Control Nano&quot; hacked apart (I got it for a real bargain $59) to match the profile of the enclosure. All about keeping the size to a minimum. Which became a desire when I realized how big and clumsy the home made enclosure I was building, was likely to end up.

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2144b63c3ebd5582b7862aae0588b8c8357a5e76.jpg&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;414&quot;&gt;

And I even managed to print a label for the front face.
2 expression pedals to be pluged into PA0 and PA1, may add more later.
Audio In
Audio Send -&gt; This will give me an option to plug in other effects pedals for whatever reason.
Audio Return
Audio out

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/e/eea49650fd944972ac2b3bb76c4ee06613e3fa16.jpg&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;414&quot;&gt;

And the inside.
Which includes the Axoloti, with the midi separated and mounted over the BCN44 midi connections and power inputs. To save space I removed the midi inputs and wired the raw midi male dins without their housing. The BCN44 is wired to the power rails in the JP3 connections so it automatically switches on when I plug in the Axo. Then there are a few wires routed into the top half where the rotary controllers, buttons and all the other midi process done. 

The BCN44 will store up to 99 presets of 8 buttons and 4 rotary controllers, I can store the value of each within the preset which can also be dumped into the Axo when triggered, I am thinking that this will be a good way to store any value adjustments I make. I am thinking of ways that I maybe able to add some connections that will store my values before I leave the current preset, and dumps the values when I arrive to a new stored preset.

The next step is to build a row of foot switches that can be connected to the buttons for foot control, and preset change. I will be able to disconnect the foot switches so I can work with the unit, with the PC.
I have ordered some momentary foot switches, and they are on their way... !

I am quite pleased with this outcome.... !
Thanks...</description>

              <p>Thanks Techno,<br>All USB micro powered, as soon as I plug the USB in, everything lights up.<br>This will also make it very handy using portable USB power battery.<br>And yes PA0/1 go to the Axo directly for pedal input.<br>And yes for the SND/RET all the inputs are now mono, don't need stereo for guitar.<br>My zoom b3 can also be powered by USB and be connected to the SND/RET.<br>One of my aims is to be able to connect an effect to the SND/RET and try to model it in the Axo patch, and I can have the patch flick between the 2 for comparison.</p>

              <p>Nice... looks like a nice flexible solution.</p>

<p>is it usb powered? (seeing as the DC jacks done appear to be accessible)</p>

<p>im a bit confused about the jacks.<br>PA0/1 are going to the axo board directly (I assume?) for pedal input.<br>the SND/RET appear to be wired to the in/out?  does this mean you now have it such that the in/out are now mono (eg. left) and the snd/ret are the other channel (e.g in/out right)</p>

<p>nice project <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=2" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
