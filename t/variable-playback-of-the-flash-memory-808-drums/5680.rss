    <title>Variable playback of the flash memory 808 drums?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/variable-playback-of-the-flash-memory-808-drums/5680</link>
    <description>Hello :) 

I am lurking a bit around in the depth of the factory objects and I stumbled upon a flash read interp object, I think it is a derivative of the wave/flashplay object. 

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/f/fc02fdea7cb75dd495b011a2f48e1803233d790e.png&quot; width=&quot;357&quot; height=&quot;141&quot;&gt;

But for some reason it does not work, seems like it is not &quot;finished&quot;. It seems like the file reference is not working.

This is from the log, when I try to go live:
**Generate code complete**
**Creating directory on sdcard : /untitled**
**Done creating directory**
**Changing working directory on sdcard : /untitled**
**Done changing working directory**
**Start compiling patch**
**Compiling patch... with /Applications/Axoloti.app/Contents/Java/firmware**
**BDIR = /Users/jakobskouborg/Documents/axoloti/build**
**FIRMWARE = .**
**RM**
**APP**
**! /Users/jakobskouborg/Documents/axoloti/build/xpatch.h.gch**
**LINK**
**/Users/jakobskouborg/Documents/axoloti/build/xpatch.o: In function `PatchProcess(long*, long*)&#39;:**
**xpatch.cpp:(.text+0x164): undefined reference to `_binary_808bd_raw_start&#39;**
**collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status**
**make: *** [/Users/jakobskouborg/Documents/axoloti/build/xpatch.bin] Error 1**
**shell task failed, exit value: 2**
**Compiling patch failed ( untitled )** 

It would actually be really nice to have variable playback of these files so you could pitch them, reverse them and so on.

@johannes, do you have a finished version of this object somewhere, that you wouldn&#39;t mind sharing?

 Or maybe someone else made something similar?

Thanks!</description>
