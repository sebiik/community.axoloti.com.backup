    <description>I have an outdoor installation project in development and wondered if anyone might have suggestions for solar-powering an Axoloti.</description>

              <p>Thanks for the reply. I haven't yet received the Axoloti core I ordered but I anticipate that its line or headphone output would be able to directly drive a very tiny speaker. I've been using the line output of a typical audio interface for testing some things out. The installation would involve just that one speaker. If you have experience with various power packs could you direct me to something you think might work?</p>

              <p>I live off-grid, so my axolotl's have been solar powered from day one<br>... but I suspect you need a more portable solution mine;) </p>

<p>more seriously, what do you need it to do?  just power axoloti?, or speakers?, and for how long? for one day... or for many months?<br>if its just the axoloti, id have thought a solar backed power pack would be fine... but PAs and things start needing a lot more power.... I think some of the busker cubes these days might be able to also supply power via usb?</p>
