    <title>Startup not working for simple file playback patch</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/startup-not-working-for-simple-file-playback-patch/3229</link>
    <description>I asked basically the same question in another part of this forum, so forgive me... but I am really at a loss as to why my patch, which simply does looping playback of an audio file, isn&#39;t behaving when I try to run it at startup. [Here is the patch](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2trktn28v523xjp/loopingFilePlayback2.axp?dl=1), which has a play fn stereo going through a couple of paraEQs on its way to the audio out. Super simple. I also included pink noise just for testing purposes.

The patch runs fine in &#39;Live&#39; mode and when I &#39;upload to SD card as startup&#39; there are no errors reported. When I disconnect from USB and run the board off an external power supply, my patch runs -- I can verify that with the pink noise -- but the file playback doesn&#39;t start.

Can anyone tell me if there is a trick to starting the play fn upon startup? I tried using a loadbang with a delayedpulse to make sure that the playback started well after the Axoloti&#39;s startup but that didn&#39;t work.

Thanks for any suggestions... I assume that this is not a bug but it definitely is unexpected behaviour.</description>

              <p>Ummm, I just figured out a solution, which was to copy my audio file to the root of the SD card. It wasn't being found in the subdirectory for my patch, for some reason.</p>
