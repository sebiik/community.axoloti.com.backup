        <p>I asked basically the same question in another part of this forum, so forgive me... but I am really at a loss as to why my patch, which simply does looping playback of an audio file, isn't behaving when I try to run it at startup. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2trktn28v523xjp/loopingFilePlayback2.axp?dl=1" rel="nofollow noopener">Here is the patch</a>, which has a play fn stereo going through a couple of paraEQs on its way to the audio out. Super simple. I also included pink noise just for testing purposes.</p>

<p>The patch runs fine in 'Live' mode and when I 'upload to SD card as startup' there are no errors reported. When I disconnect from USB and run the board off an external power supply, my patch runs -- I can verify that with the pink noise -- but the file playback doesn't start.</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me if there is a trick to starting the play fn upon startup? I tried using a loadbang with a delayedpulse to make sure that the playback started well after the Axoloti's startup but that didn't work.</p>

<p>Thanks for any suggestions... I assume that this is not a bug but it definitely is unexpected behaviour.</p>

        <p>Ummm, I just figured out a solution, which was to copy my audio file to the root of the SD card. It wasn't being found in the subdirectory for my patch, for some reason.</p>
