I just flicked together this tutorial on how to create one cycle waveforms for Axoloti. You can use it instead on an oscillator and gives some new options. Anyway here goes:

        <p>Just got around to testing the reset function. You can delete it, it does not do anything. THe wavetable is reset everytime it is retriggered by default. I think the problem I had actually is related to the envelopes not being able to be reset everytime. Like a monophonic envelope that is retriggered everytime. Axolotis envelopes behaves a little bit differently.</p>

        <p>Thanks for this, very useful.<br>I've been testing a load of one cycle samples collected by Adventure Kid : <a href="http://www.adventurekid.se/akrt/waveforms/adventure-kid-waveforms/">4300 one cycle waveforms</a> .<br>I needed to convert them to 48kHz, 1024 samples long and RAW, but once done, it can add some great oscillators to the Axoloti capacities.</p>

        <p>some of those waveforms are nice</p>

<p>surely there must be a command line app that can do this conversion, would be great to just point it to a directory for it to do them all.</p>

        <p>Why use batch script(except if you want to converted a lot at the same time, but that is not advisable since wavetable vary a lot in size.. some are 356 samples, some are 1234, some are other sizes, so they dont need to be stretched same amount). In audacity there is a function called change speed that lets you set the exact sample length in samples. BUt yeah, it take a little bit of " hard" work to get started to get a library going.....</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/mtyas">@mtyas</a></p>

<p>If you want to dig into wavetables I'd suggest to also check Serum VST/AU. Very capable of making wavetables, both 1 and multicycles..... Serum export 1cycle WTs in wav and 2048 samples long.. SO you ONLY have to drag them into audacity and convert them to .raw... file size is perfectl al ready..</p>

<blockquote><p>surely there must be a command line app that can do this conversion, would be great to just point it to a directory for it to do them all.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>Just have in mind that wavetables are NOT all 32, 64, 128 waves.. some have weird sized, in context to Axoloti.... And with the multi cycle wavetables sizes and wave numbers are VERY important.. if you try to stretch a 142 wavetable with a sample size of 2631333 samples you CANNOT stretch it to axolotis tabel sizes and expect it to be click free... There will be a lot of clickin, cause the indexing will not de right</p>

<p>WHat I do is import them into Serum first and check how many waves they actually have(most wavetables from the web does not gives this info, yuo have to find out yourself).. ANd for example if the wavetable is 140 waves.... you just cut away down to 128 waves.. and export it. and since Serum converts it automacitally to riggh sizes, this is the best way to go, imo.... </p>

<p>So one cycles are pretty  easy.. but take care with the multi wavetables.  Batch processing i dont think wil be succesfull, cause you have to get hands on with each indivudually file anyway to get sizes wave nr, etc...</p>

        <p><a class="mention" href="/users/jaffasplaffa">@jaffasplaffa</a>,  yup I recognise this, but I was talking specifically about the adventure kid samples, which are all identical in size/sample rate etc but there are a huge number of them <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p><span class="mention">@mytas</span> why did you convert them to 1024 in length, are you just standardising on the size?<br>since the playback mechanism can be adapted to any size.</p>

<p>(hmmm, we should actually make the table load return the file read size as an outlet, to allow it to be dynamic)</p>

        <p>ANyway you can already set the table siezes dynamically......</p>

<p>Just set denominator for 2 instead of 1. And change the tablesize to 2048.. Then you can play 1024 samples WT in a 2048 samples table.... Use the position to test it:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First test the position with table of 1024 sample size and denominator to 1 and and scan through the 1cycle with the position. with 1024 samplesize wave of course.</p></li>
<li><p>Then change the tablesize to 2048 and denominator to 2 and scan though it again with the position.. These two setting sounds EXACTLY identilcal......</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But yeah, regarding the Adventure kid samples. I had them already... and they are not all same sample sizes. some are 1024, some are 2048 some are 4096, etc.... So batch converting is still not the best idea for this.. Like Mtyas mention it is better to do it by hand, cause there are many variables that can go wrong, which wil jst leave them useless.</p>

<p>For example a lot of the Serum wavetables you find are morphed wavetables so they actually consist of only very few waves,, like 4-6 waves. These I dont know how to import to Axoloti yet..</p>

<blockquote><p>But yeah, regarding the Adventure kid samples. I had them already... and they are not all same sample sizes. some are 1024, some are 2048 some are 4096, etc....</p></blockquote></aside>

<p><aside class="quote"><blockquote><p>All in one pack!<br>You probably want to download one of the all in one pack. It contains all the single cycle wave forms. The wave format work with many samplers and synths and there are some packages containing samples formatted for ones that need a different format. I choose to sample thes waveforms at D2+2 which equals 600 samples. The biggest reason for that was because I was using Fibonacci sequences to build sounds. As the synths, samplers and computers got better at handling single cycle wave forms it made less sense but I kept the standard of 600 samples anyway.</p></blockquote></aside></p>

<p>Really, perhaps we are talking about different ones...<br>Im looking at the AKWF set, these have a a readme which says they are all 600 samples long, and and all Ive looked at are 44.1/16 bit.</p>

<p>perhaps your looking at a different version?<br>anyway no matter, it was just a passing comment anyway.</p>

<blockquote><p>Do you think some day it will be able to read wav files (kind of skip the header function), it could save some time and complications for new users</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>I discussed this with Johannes the other day, as I thought it would be 'relatively straightforward', <br>and his answer was very interesting...<br>the reason he hadn't done this so far, is due to block sizes on the SD cards, essentially the wave headers offset the real wave data, such that streaming it would be less efficient. </p>

<p>so what we thought was:<br>a) perhaps have this 'inefficiency' but warning, that raw files are better... the issue with this, is no matter how many times you remind people, they will use wav files as its the easy way <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>b) conversion... this is the better way, but more work, provide some kind of conversion mechanism such that when you transfer the files they are converted from wav to raw. this makes more sense since potentially we can then expand the conversion formats (or resampling), and also means its done once, with the powerful cpu of the computer rather than the limited resources of the STM32F4.<br>this is probably also in line with thinking on package management etc.</p>

<blockquote><p>So although it works, I don't completely understand how it works. Left bottom, the objects for wavetable position (why does it have to go through the /divremc and the /nointerp ?). And the part that resets the wavetable doesn't seem to do anything in my case.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>Oh, forgot to explain a bit here. The divremc c makes it play only 1 cycle at a time. The 1 cycle length is set by the phasor oscs frequency. </p>

<p>The no interp make sure the position knob only controls position and not the pitch.. the pitch is controlled by the phasor osc... So it is basicly to seperate pitch and position control <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>Hope that helps <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

        <p>Finally finished up my new enclosure and had a go at the wavetable stuff tonight. Seems to work well! I'm still downloading the 1.0.6 patcher (github seems to be throttled on my ISP?) so I have to use the old file browser to add the files for now. <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/expressionless.png?v=0" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"> </p>

<p>However the bulk import/export functions in audacity seem to be working well for the adventurekid waveforms so far. Importing/exporting 10 at a time is a breeze, so should be able to finish up a batch quickly. I may be truncating the files on playback, but they sound good to me – will have to test accuracy against some other WT player (maybe in max msp?). My enclosure has a 2-digit seven segment display so I'll try to winnow it down to 100 of my favorites and then be able to scroll through them on the synth.</p>

<p>Also interested in the "morph" functions I've seen on Serum and Massive (don't have either myself), I wonder if it'd be possible to build a feature like that into a synth patch. If it's a simple x-fade, it might be as easy as having 2 selectable waveforms and a fade control. Would be great to hook up to an envelope I suspect.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on wavetable synths I should check out for design ideas? Have been meaning to snag the demo of NI massive anyway, but I'm a complete n00b to the wavetable game, so all recommendations are welcome!</p>

        <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="/users/matthewcieplak">@matthewcieplak</a></p>

<p>Nice. Wavetables are the best <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> I never use regular oscillators anymore. Only wavetables <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>I just checked a few of the adventure kid 1 cycle waves and they are all 600 samples long each and they are 16 bit 44.1khz. That is great. They can be used in different ways in Axoloti:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>This is in my opinion the best way.<br>Open up Audacity and load up one of the 600 samples long waves.<br>Next highlight the whole file and go to effect and choose change speed. <br>Change the speed to Axolotis closest table size in SAMPLES. That would be 512 samples. Then you know for a FACT that the file fit perfectly in the table.</p></li>
<li><p>This is the easiest way, since you already changed the files to raw and it would be a hassle to go back to Audacity and strecth all one by one. But this is NOT perfect and will definatly create clicks in many situations, cause it is not always 100% precise like first way I suggested.<br>The solution is to calcualte how many percentage of the table/alloc the raw file actually fills up.<br>You do that this way. For this you HAVE to set tabelsize to be bigger than the file:<br>Tablesize = 1024 samples<br>.raw adventure kid samplesize = 600 samples</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Dividide the .raw files samplesize with tables:<br>600/1027 = 0,5859375      which is 58,59375 % </p>

<p>You see not precise. This percentage would be rounded to 58,59% in Axoloti. Anyway to set it up this way you would have to connect an attentuator between the phasor osc and the table/play object and set the attenuator to 58.59%</p>

<p>It is a solution, but I wouldnt use it. I would personally go back and change the speed of every single file individually. That way you get the best result. And even better, just make it a habit doing them one by one. Wavetables are very different and for example for especially multi wavetablesl Serums morhped wavetable will not work in axoloti(as for now), cause they basicly only consist of 4-8 waves. So if you try to use a wavetable that was morphed and you are not aware it wont sound right. Also a lot of the wavetable pack out there, the individual files are not same size, length etc. Som there are god reason to go through them manually. It can be a lot of work, but very rewarding when done <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> </p>

<p>About the morph waves. I believe it can be done with Axoloti as it is now. I already build a wavetable creator patch which you can check out here. Need to do the final work on it before i can share final version with saving included. Anyway, check the patch here and a small video that shows it in action <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

  <blockquote>Hey [:smile:] Have been working on this patch for creating wavetable in Axoloti, not just loading them, but creating them from scratch, using Axolotis oscillators. And I think I got it working pretty well for now.. Anyway, just wanted to post a preview. Its recorded from a phone so the quality is not that good and you cannot here the sound only some mouse clicking. Sorry. But you can see the waveform change as harmonics are added. And morphed… the patch can create 1 cycle wavetables.  1cycle = 1…

    </div>
  </blockquote>
</aside>


<p>But yeah, got a few ideas how to implement morphed waves in a more controlled fashion than the one from the link. WOuld like to make a version which moprhes a few waves at a time. For example start out as a saw wave and moprh into a sine wave. Actually  think it can be done with the one I posed already now that I think of it.</p>

        <p>mhehehehehe, this is sweet:<br>1. download AKWF waveforms (4358 different waveforms), "advanced renamer" and audacity v2 (v1 crashes!)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>throw all the AKWF waveforms in the same map (they come in different maps) and rename them using Advanced Renamer to W0000 to W4358.</p></li>
<li><p>Load the waveforms into audacity (my computer only handles 500 at a time, nope, re-edit (again), you'll probably have to restart the computer after around 1000 files to clear the cache....<em>sighs</em>)</p></li>
<li><p>set audacity internal rate to 48K</p></li>
<li><p>resample all waveforms to 48K (this may take quite a while)</p></li>
<li><p>adjust the playback speed: percentage= -36.23 for 1024 samples length</p></li>
<li><p>go to "export multiple", select "other uncompressed files" and set to Raw (headerless), signed 16-bit-PCM</p></li>
<li><p>now you'll need to press down the enter button a couple of minutes, to press "yes" for each file repeatedly (when closing in on the last file, go easy, otherwise it might restart the whole saving process and you'll need to go around one more time haha)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>now you've got 4358 raw waveforms to build yourself a massive wavetable oscillator <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=0" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>Use the index string module, enter W0, W1, W2, W3 or W4 in the name, or load 5 index string modules with W0 to W4 as their names and use a mux to select one of them, Raw as extension and use the index to select any of the waveforms (000 to 999). Remember though.. W4 "only" has 358 samples under it's hood.. <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Another edit:<br>I've just send all the waveforms to "Adventure Kid", so he can post them on his website. So just wait a while and you can just download them instead of having them all manually redo them yourself (I don't think I'm allowed to upload them myself)</p>

        <p>Some remarks:<br>* With a one-cycle wavetable, the sample rate of the wave is irrelevant<br>* I strongly suspect sample rate conversion in audacity (and other similar software) assumes silence before and after the wave, while wavetables should be assumed cyclic. <br>* The right way change the length of wavetables is going through (unwindowed) fourier transform. A tool to do this is, is with a small script in numpy, gnu octave, or Matlab (or anything similar), but I currently have no time to dedicate to this.<br>* there are 2 interpretations of a wavetable: bandwidth limited or assuming all of its samples are converted by a pitch-synchronous DAC.<br>* there are many tricks to improve the properties of wavetable playback: <a href="https://www.dafx12.york.ac.uk/papers/dafx12_submission_69.pdf">https://www.dafx12.york.ac.uk/papers/dafx12_submission_69.pdf</a></p>

        <p>Cool, thanks <a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>I am pretty sure that Serum uses windowed fourier transform. I know the opposite of what you mention. But if you import a file into Serum and export it again, it has got fade in/outs on each wave. This makes sure all indexing is pretty good and make sure that there is a lot less clicks that just importing a wav(.raw) into axoloti. That would create a lot more clicks. I made some wavetable from movie clips, with a lot going on, that works pretty well this way. </p>

<p>I kind of thought I covered most aspects of wavetables by now. But will defiantly look into the suggestions you have <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
