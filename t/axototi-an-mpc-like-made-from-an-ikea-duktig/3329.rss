I&#39;ve been meaning to get an Axoloti for quite some time now.
Not knowing what to box it in or what to make of it really I came across this thing whilst buying new furni for my new apartment, something about the likeness to old school drum machines and MPC&#39;s stuck with me.

I have some really wicked ideas but for the most part it&#39;s mostly to house it there and to make the buttons trigger different actions from the axoloti, humble beginnings.

Any ideas and inspiration is GREATLY appreciated. 

Have a good day people!</description>

              <p>I assume that the ribbon connects the processor to the LCD display. It's probably not going to help you read the buttons directly.</p>

<p>Reading the buttons might be easy. If you're willing to build a new PCB using a cheap service like OSHPark, then you could make a compatible board with the same screw holes and align the sensors under the buttons. You would probably only need a 2-layer board (very cheap and quick) and you could add a connector to feed the Axoloti.</p>

<p>Writing to the display is probably going to be much harder. So long as the original processor board is attached to the display, it will be difficult to change what is displayed. If you disconnect the LCD, then you'll have to find out which pins are power and which control the content. If there is a part number on the display, then perhaps you can find documentation. If not, then you have a lot of hacking to do, and it might result in damage to the display if you're not careful. Also, disconnecting the display could damage it. It looks like this thing is soldered together and not meant to be serviced or replaced.</p>

              <p>ok now i did, </p>

<p>does the ribbon connect the two circuit boards together or is there something in between?</p>

<p>there are more stripes in the ribbon then buttons, so you might actually be in luck here!</p>

<p>if you have a multimeter you can measure which ribbon strip belongs to which pad and which is ground. that should be enough info to hack it.</p>
