    <title>What would be required to build patcher for browser</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/what-would-be-required-to-build-patcher-for-browser/7581</link>
    <description>The shower thought of the morning is inspired by the excellent M8 display PWA for Dirtywaves M8 tracker. 
Imagine you could fire up Axoloti patcher in a browser. 
Or just a gui, with a low level usb handled server side. Imagine axoloti running connected to a Norns as host. Just open the patcher GUI on your desktop machine etc, then send to axo without the need to unplug the usb.

What would be necessary? 
Could emscripten compile the existing codebase? Did anyone try? 
Would the chromium USB/serial API be sufficient for client side connection?
Etc.</description>

              <p>Years ago, there was a port which could run with STM32 Discovery board, and about 2 years ago, new hardware was designed by a user here (urklang on this forum), using a newer, faster STM H7 chip and different codec. This was called Akso, and resulted from discussions here lamenting Axoloti unavailability.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Akso hardware never became reliably available, and the port of the software and firmware needed a lot more polishing, Nick needed to get a real job</p>

<p>Then COVIDâ€¦</p>

<p>I think the Axoloti system is brilliant, but for various reasons, it fell short of its potential.</p>

<p>The lack of hardware could be addressed by porting Axoloti to more platforms. Where there any ports to other, more generic, boards?</p>

              <p> I don't know the exact details but this resonates with some of my other thoughts:<br>I don't think Axoloti should be forgotten!  It is way too huge and powerful of a step in the right direction.<br>I would love to see it made a little more open and flexible, e.g. system diagrams drawn, some basic API documentation, etc., so that it can be continuously ported into new projects, such as this one.</p>
