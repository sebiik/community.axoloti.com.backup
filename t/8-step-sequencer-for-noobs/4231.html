        <p>I am still very green when it comes to synth and sequencers etc, and am always looking for new stuff to learn and incorporate into my projects.<br>With the midi foot controller I have built, I have realized I could very easily use it to control an 8 step sequencer, it will have 2 rows of on/off switches, and 2 rows of adjustable parameters, very similar I guess to this device.. (not including the inputs outputs etc..)<br><img src="../../uploads/default/original/2X/8/81cc0acca57a1bdfb64a956e078114ae3efc37da.png" width="518" height="278"><br>I have watched video about sequencers so I sought of get that each row is for triggering a specific event, and the parameters can adjust the levels of the trigger, and each step is the change in sequence. So I could understand, I can have a sample for each row, each step switched on or off to trigger, with the parameter setting the volume level set for each step.</p>

<p>But what I really want is to learn and understand better how to really use to sequencer, because at the moment, I really struggle to visualize or imagine the variety of ways in which I could use it.</p>

<p>Can anyone recommend any tutorials or video's etc I could use to gain some insight in ways I could use an 8 step sequencer like the one I have described. I have been searching the web the best way I know how, and a lot of it appears to be performance use or lots of in depth patching on a synth, or maybe its just all beyond me.. !!</p>

<p>On a side note, I know from what I have seen that a lot of sequencers are triggered with LFO's and trigger at a fixed rate like a drum machine etc.. but I was thinking less about a fixed rate, but more like the rate of change for each step is triggered manually. This I believe will give more options on what I could with the sequencer ?</p>

        <p>It maybe doesnt fall under the 8 steps sequencer category, but some of the best sequencers around that comes in a finished project, in my opinion at least, are Elektron sequencers. Like Digitakt or Octatrack for example.</p>

<p>So if you want some inspiration for sequencer use, check out their tutorials for their products. Read the manuals. They got their famous "P-lock" for example. Which means parameter lock and it means you can assign different parameter values to each step of the sequencer. Which opens up a whole new ball game <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>Anyway, check them out, they are really inspiring products when it comes to sequencing <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
