    <title>DC chaining with + - pins</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/dc-chaining-with-pins/3210</link>
    <description>I started to daisy chain 2 Axolotis and a little mixer with the + - pins next to the dc input.

So dc is coming from a wall wart or battery into the dc plug of board 1 and is being split via the two + + pins to board 2 (also to the pins) and a mixer. - is connected via the - pin of the other bord and gnd of board 1 to ground of the mixer.

Is this a good Idea? anything I should be careful with?</description>
