    <title>Doepfer USB 64 for control interface</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/doepfer-usb-64-for-control-interface/803</link>
    <description>I am new to the community, just got my board.  I am  looking to use the platform in two ways. To use with my EMS Synthis (that will be board #2)  the thing I current want to get started on is to fly out as many common controls to a console for ease of use, that is lin line with mypersonal work flow. I have not seen any refernces to the Doepfer USB 64 encoder interface.  I would be interested to know if anyone has tried using one.  I have had some success using them with IOS devices and and hoping that I could use it to devirtualise Axoloti for my ease of use.</description>

              <p>I have no experience with the USB64, but looking at doepfers website there is no reason it shouldn't work:</p>

<ul>
<li>USB connection with axoloti as host should work, USB64 claims to be class compliant and if it works on iOS it is surely class complient.</li>
<li>Hardware midi cable to axoloti MIDI in should also definitely work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, if you have the stuff already, just plug it in and try!</p>
