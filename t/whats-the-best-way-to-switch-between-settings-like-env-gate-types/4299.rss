    <title>What&#39;s the best way to &quot;switch&quot; between settings, like env gate types?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/whats-the-best-way-to-switch-between-settings-like-env-gate-types/4299</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using the midi/inkeyb/ zone lru object to control two ADSR&#39;s, as it has a &quot;legato&quot; gate and a &quot;retrig&quot; gate. Very handy for routing to synths. BUT. Is there an easy way to switch between the two modes? Like, sending the two differing gate types through a switch mechanism before it hits the ADSR&#39;s? I can&#39;t work out how to do this one. Also, I&#39;d eventually like to switch this by using the GPIO digital ins with some physical switches, so an option that would make this easy would be great.

Similarly, I&#39;m using the tb/env/cycle AD as a fun loping env - but is there an easy way to switch the cycle off? Then I could have an easily loop-able AD env, which would be cool. Again, eventually using a physical switch to change them over. @thetechnobear is this possible within the object, or would it need separate AD envs (one looping, one not) that are switched?

While we&#39;re at it, I&#39;ve finally worked out a way to have a bipolar &quot;depth&quot; control for my envelopes (like on a hardware synth - the &quot;contour&quot; control on moogs), but it feels like a bit of a long workaround - can someone let me know if there&#39;s a easier/more elegant way? Screenshot attached

Finally, is there an easy way to add text to a patch, like in some of the tutorial patches? I feel like I&#39;m missing something simple with that one!&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3d5966c233a7ca676ed4e3f4d4f94856d7724c92.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;197&quot;&gt;</description>

              <p>sure you can switch the modes like this:</p>

<p>for text  in a patch use the comment "object".</p>

<p>unipolar to bipolar should be easy, there is an object for that as well: unipolar2bipolar.</p>

<p>the env from <a class="mention" href="/u/thetechnobear">@thetechnobear</a> could be made into a new object to make this switchable.</p>
