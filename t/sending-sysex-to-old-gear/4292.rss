    <title>Sending sysex to old gear</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/sending-sysex-to-old-gear/4292</link>
    <description>Hello,

I was wondering whether there is an easy way to send midi sysex info to old rack units? I&#39;ve got a Roland d110 on the way and am interested in some of the Yamaha fm ones too, but they all seem to use sysex rather than cc for everything. Guess this was before midi CCs became standardised? Anyway, is there an easy way to send midi sysex info from a text box or something? There was a thread last year in the dev section that mentioned it is possible, but it didn&#39;t say how to do it. I guess there&#39;s no object, but anything would be handy. It&#39;s possible with PD, but would love to do it with my axo. Thanks.</description>

<p>Hey,</p>

<p>Did you figure this out? I would be interested in the results as well. I'll try something my self later this week I agree with jan for using the script object, but I'll need an implementation example to do it ( object is empty when I load it)<br>If I se an implementation I think I can hack it together (scriptkiddiestyle <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
