    <title>Sample Location Questions</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/sample-location-questions/2148</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been playing around with Axoloti as a simple .wav playback device and have hit a couple of questions.

1) If the playback patch is uploaded as the startup patch, where do the samples need to sit on the SD card?  Or, what is the folder structure to use in the wave/play fn stereo object?  So far, I&#39;ve been putting the samples I want to use in the same folder as the patch, but can this be done with the start.bin file?

2) I gather that for straight playback of files, using the internal flash memory makes for a more stable set up.  Same question, if the patch is in internal flash and the samples on the SD card, what is the right file structure to use?  If that&#39;s round the wrong way, how do you upload .wav&#39;s to internal flash?

Thanks!</description>

<li><p>Startup patches, and patches launching from internal flash assume the files are located in the root directory of the sdcard. Other patches use the patch directory on sdcard as default.</p></li>
<li><p>Modification of the samples present in flash memory is not exposed to users. The reason is that different patches may require a different sampleset in flash memory, while (re)writing to internal flash memory is slow. If you look at the source-code you'll find how it is done, but doing so way will lead to patches that can't be exchanged in the community.<br>The alternative to samples present in flash memory is loading them into a table in SDram. Check "table/alloc 16b sdram load" and "table/play".</p></li>
