    <title>How to send 14bits CC to Axoloti with BCR 2000</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/how-to-send-14bits-cc-to-axoloti-with-bcr-2000/6609</link>
    <description>Hello,

I have now a BCR 2000 midi controler from Behringer, and I&#39;ve read various posts mentioning 14bits resolution is working to control axoloti&#39;s patches.
More precisely, the midi/in/cc hr does not react with the 14bit resolution (checking with a disp/dial object).
I assume that midi/in/cc hr works with the standard pairs while midi/in/cc hr ii allows to combine non standards CC numbers. Anyone could confirm that? 

It is probably a BCR set up issue, since I have the same 7bit result when I patch according this post http://community.axoloti.com/t/midi-in-cc-hr-issues-solved/4520

I&#39;ve been digging in the BCR&#39;s official manual, trough the mountain utilities docs and forum and many other places without any clear explanation on how to set up 14bits CCs in the BCR. When I set the knob on absolute 14bit, I find no way to define or verify the LSB CC number.
Many people here use the BCR so I dare to ask them, at least to know where I can learn more about this!
Thank you very much!

@thetechnobear, feel free to tell me the right place for this post if I am not already in!</description>
