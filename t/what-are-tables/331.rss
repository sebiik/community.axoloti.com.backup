    <title>What are tables?</title>

    <description>What are the tables? I know it can seem like a trivial question, but apart from the classic blocks with which you can create synths, axoloti has many functions that do not understand. There is a list with a little description for the modules?</description>

              <p>I understand tables better now after working with it for a few days. Have found alot of  potential in them, but I am sure I am still missing out on a lot. It probably has many uses. <br>I checked the help files, but to be honest more clear tutorials, which is aimed at people who do not know anything about programming would be nice. </p>

<p>But again I guess it is part of the trip when you buy a modular synth: you have to get familiar with a lot of new terms.  I learned so much about math during the last week and it is pretty nice <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile"> Sooo many times I was close to making a new thread in here, but resisted and did a google search instead and found out. Some things I guess we have to ask in here, since only people here know about it. But yeah I learned more about tables from reading in here, but would love to see a tutorial on different examples of use.</p>

<p>Urbanspaceman: Also look at the Wavetable synth example. That one is pretty nice <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt="wink"></p>

              <p>tables are 'arrays', so a collection of data... <br>i.e.  table 8b size 2, has two data elements of 8 bit, bipolar data (i.e. -127 to 127) <br>you can read and write to them using an index... </p>

<p>why are they useful, well, the data is 'arbitrary' ie. we can use if for whatever we like, <br>so one example might be to store a waveform.</p>

<p>if you click on help, then there are examples of how to use.</p>

<p>they exist in most visual programming languages (e.g. Reaktor/Max) and are perhaps a little more complex concept, if you have not done any programming before, and tend to be for more advanced uses as they are lower level.</p>
