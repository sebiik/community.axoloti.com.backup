    <title>Midi notes selection (not consecutive)</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/midi-notes-selection-not-consecutive/6302</link>
    <description>Here I go with another newbie question.
I still trying to tame the Twister midi fighter sequencer (I&#39;m having a hard time cause you can&#39;t change what midi notes or CC it send) .
I know if I make the patch using another sequencer (like a Akai mpc for example) it will be not a problem BUT in trying to take as much I can from a minimal setup(Just the Twiste MF and the Axoloti).
   Let me explain the MF twister´s sequencer limitations (or the way its design) first.
MFtwister Sequencer use midi channel 8 for sending messages(is not possible to change midi channel).MFtwister sequencer have 4 tracks each of them send CC message(track 1=cc10; track 2=cc1 and so on) and a midi note at a time, each track can select between 11 different notes BUT THEY ARE NO CONSECUTIVE NOTES (track1=c2,e2,G#2,c3...etc etc. 4semitones jumps) 
(track2=c#2,f2,a2,c#3...etc etc. the same as track 1 but one semitone higher) 
(track3 2semitones higher than track1 and track 4 3semitones higher that track1).
OK that was the MF twister sequencer functionality .in the hardware side It have 4 knobs(pushables) per track
 1 knob select midi note by rotate the knob (if you push it it sends CC 106 ON/OFF toggle style)
2 knob select pattern by rotate it (if you push it jumps to pattern editor)
3 knob its a attenuator of the cc messages send by the sequencer.(if you push it you get CC20 message out of it...I think its HOLD style,,,I mean it send CC20 higher value only if the knobs is been hold down)
4 knob send CC28 when been rotated and CC24 when been pushed HOLD STYLE)...

   UFFFF are you guys still with me? (sorry its a long post I know but I like to make a proper explanation so you can&#39;t understand the problematic.

MY GOAL its to change CC messages destination by changing the midi note of the MF twister sequencer. (I´m working in a 4track LIVE sampler patch BTW)

   the GOOD new its that Im nearly there.
My first approach was using midi/in/keyb note object. BUT I find 2 main problems:
1: its not a very SRAM friendly approach
2:if I change the note knob ,from the MFTwister, when the note it ON,the note still playing 
to avoid this problem I start using the midi/in/keyb mod object instead. it works fine BUT then I have a new problem MIDI CHANNEL 8 its been used for the 4 MFtwister sequencer tracks. THE result its a total mess.     
 So im thinks in a way of select certain midi notes (not consecutive) OR maybe a totally different approach witch im not thinking about...I don&#39;t know maybe a way to separate the midi messages from each sequencer track( but im do not really know if that is possible).

MAYBE changing the MFtwister Program its a solution (cause the people from MIDI FIGHTER (DJTT) told it is open source) BUT not for me .... I don&#39;t know how to write code.


SORRY FOR MY LOOOOOONG POST AND MY ENGLISH GRAMA 
I hope some one have an idea. I know its a specific thing im asking But im trying to tame MF twister with some Axoloti super powers! 
BTW Happy New Year! :grin:</description>

<p>that was my testing patch for the sequencer part of my 4 tracks live sampler patch.<br>if some one its interested</p>
