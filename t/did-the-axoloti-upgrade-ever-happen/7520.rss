    <title>Did the Axoloti upgrade ever happen?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/did-the-axoloti-upgrade-ever-happen/7520</link>
    <description>A while back (several years now), I made a post regarding an Axoloti upgrade.

To my memory, I did get a few replies mentioning that there was the possibility of a new, more powerful board coming out, so my question is.....did this ever happen or have people moved on to something else?

I see that there&#39;s nothing for sale on the main site, which half answers my question but perhaps there are still things in the pipeline.....anyone know?</description>

<p>There were another attemp with Akso:</p>

<p>But I am afraid it had the same fortunes that original Axoloti and now it is stopped.</p>
