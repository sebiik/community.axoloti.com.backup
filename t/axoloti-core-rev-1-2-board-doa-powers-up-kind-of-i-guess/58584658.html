        <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="../../u/steveo.html">@steveo</a>, thanks for the reply. At least we're not alone here.</p>

<p>So I haven't really messed around with this Axo since last weekend. It appeared to be working fine for awhile until I left it powered up for an indeterminate amount of time and walked away. When I came back, it looked like it was in a constant reboot cycle. It definitely seems like it has a mind of its own. Sometimes it'll work for awhile, other times it will go into the reboot cycle any time I plug a USB cable into it to power it (either via a computer or one of those USB AC adapters). I've been too frustrated with it to really dig in and troubleshoot since my last post when I thought everything was solved.</p>

<p>I haven't seen the unresponsive dim red LED since last post, but again, I got frustrated with it and haven't spent too much time with it since.</p>

<p>I ordered a 2.1mm 9V AC adapter a few days ago to try and see if it would be stable using something other than USB power. It came today and I've had it powered on for about an hour without issue (just powered running whatever start-up patch I had loaded onto the thing). I briefly attempted to hook it up to my PC to see if it would communicate successfully with the patcher (and it appeared to work fine). In the meantime I plan on just leaving it powered via the new AC adapter for a few hours and see if it goes into the same weird reboot cycle and reevaluate my troubleshooting strategy depending on what happens.</p>

        <p>I think you may have a point with your dupont theory. Seems to be quite literally the weakest link. I won't be using them again in future Axo projects</p>

        <p>Hey ! </p>

<p>How are your axolot mypetrobot since last year? </p>

<p>I've the same problem describe on this post. </p>

<p>The fact i've conclude is when my house is too hot like now (30degres cel ) , axoloty not working.</p>

<p>I've checked other post that describ this problem on the forum , and they have in common that they are posted during summer...</p>

<p>Like you said : When i put it on the fridge, he work a little bit then... disconnect. </p>

<p>Heat  is it a problem for all axolot ? or a consequence of something else ? Ho can we protect them ?</p>

        <p>I haven't had any heat-relatied issues as far as I know, but what I did notice is that the usb-power from my computer is barely enough to power 1 axoloti, but starts having trouble when connecting two. So I can imagine that the usb-power is often the limiting factor in connecting the axoloti to your (old?) computer. Mine is starting to be a bit old and the usb hardly even reaches 5v. I think the best you can do is to use an externally powered usb-splitter between the computer and the axoloti's to make sure there's more then enough power to run them all.<br>Also, what I did, was to write arturia to ask them to sell me their usb-y splitter seperately. This one allows for seperate connections for power and computer/usb device. Works perfectly and you can daisy-chain your axoloti's without them having them to power each other.</p>

        <p>Y-splitters are readaly available.. <br>Found this one over <a href="https://www.startech.com/Cables/USB-2.0/Micro/1foot-USB-Y-Cable-for-External-Hard-Drive-Dual-USB-A-to-Micro-B~USB2HAUBY1" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a><br>I have used some in the past for other purposes (external HD enclosures) and they worked for me. I always check if the grounds are connected though.</p>

        <p>I think it was the laptop USB power. I'm using a fairly old Macbook and it seems to cause problems when the battery is low, or going below about 20%.</p>

<p>I can imagine <a class="mention" href="../../u/skurtim-2.html">@Skurtim</a> 's problem could have something to do with heat making the CPU fan stay on and using up extra power.</p>

<p>I think it's some kind of dumb Mac "design" feature to ensure I "always get the best performance experience". Anyway, I always use external power these days and this particular issue seems to have resolved.</p>
