    <title>Axoloti Core Rev 1.2 Board DOA (powers up kind of I guess)?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/axoloti-core-rev-1-2-board-doa-powers-up-kind-of-i-guess/5858</link>
    <description>I recently purchased a used Axoloti Core off of reverb.com. It arrived today and when I went to power it on for the first time (using the same USB cable that I use for my other board) all I get is a really dim LED 1 (red). Here are a few other things I noticed if it&#39;s helpful:

- There is a faint pop from the audio output when I connect power. 
- The board is not recognized as a USB device when attached to a computer. 
- Manually pushing switch 1 causes the dim LED 1 to turn off while the switch is pressed.

Is this behavior that anyone else has experienced? Are there any troubleshooting steps I should try before I tell the seller that they sold me a dud (or it was possibly damaged during shipping)? 

Thanks in advance!</description>

<p>I can imagine <a class="mention" href="/u/skurtim">@Skurtim</a> 's problem could have something to do with heat making the CPU fan stay on and using up extra power.</p>

<p>I think it's some kind of dumb Mac "design" feature to ensure I "always get the best performance experience". Anyway, I always use external power these days and this particular issue seems to have resolved.</p>

              <p>I haven't had any heat-relatied issues as far as I know, but what I did notice is that the usb-power from my computer is barely enough to power 1 axoloti, but starts having trouble when connecting two. So I can imagine that the usb-power is often the limiting factor in connecting the axoloti to your (old?) computer. Mine is starting to be a bit old and the usb hardly even reaches 5v. I think the best you can do is to use an externally powered usb-splitter between the computer and the axoloti's to make sure there's more then enough power to run them all.<br>Also, what I did, was to write arturia to ask them to sell me their usb-y splitter seperately. This one allows for seperate connections for power and computer/usb device. Works perfectly and you can daisy-chain your axoloti's without them having them to power each other.</p>

<p>How are your axolot mypetrobot since last year? </p>

<p>I've the same problem describe on this post. </p>

<p>The fact i've conclude is when my house is too hot like now (30degres cel ) , axoloty not working.</p>

<p>I've checked other post that describ this problem on the forum , and they have in common that they are posted during summer...</p>

<p>Like you said : When i put it on the fridge, he work a little bit then... disconnect. </p>

<p>Heat  is it a problem for all axolot ? or a consequence of something else ? Ho can we protect them ?</p>

              <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="/u/steveo">@steveo</a>, thanks for the reply. At least we're not alone here.</p>

<p>So I haven't really messed around with this Axo since last weekend. It appeared to be working fine for awhile until I left it powered up for an indeterminate amount of time and walked away. When I came back, it looked like it was in a constant reboot cycle. It definitely seems like it has a mind of its own. Sometimes it'll work for awhile, other times it will go into the reboot cycle any time I plug a USB cable into it to power it (either via a computer or one of those USB AC adapters). I've been too frustrated with it to really dig in and troubleshoot since my last post when I thought everything was solved.</p>

<p>I haven't seen the unresponsive dim red LED since last post, but again, I got frustrated with it and haven't spent too much time with it since.</p>

<p>I ordered a 2.1mm 9V AC adapter a few days ago to try and see if it would be stable using something other than USB power. It came today and I've had it powered on for about an hour without issue (just powered running whatever start-up patch I had loaded onto the thing). I briefly attempted to hook it up to my PC to see if it would communicate successfully with the patcher (and it appeared to work fine). In the meantime I plan on just leaving it powered via the new AC adapter for a few hours and see if it goes into the same weird reboot cycle and reevaluate my troubleshooting strategy depending on what happens.</p>

              <p>I think if you don't just happily accept the fact that it works now, but instead try to "get to the bottom of it" you'll probably stir the wrath of the programming gods/devils and your axo board will just go up in flames. Just leave it as is.</p>

<p>That being said, i definately fried a STM32F4 board from a different platform with these shitty little dupont jumper cables. Shorts on shorts on shorts. Imagine all these little electrons travelling down the wire, and then one of them sees it and is like is "fuck guys we are doomed theres a dupont ahead. Pray to the gods so at least half of us will make it through. Ahhhhhrrrrrr its not connected at aaaaaaaalllllllllll" and falling off the voltage cliff. or something like that.</p>

              <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/mypetrobot">@mypetrobot</a>, I'm Matt's friend he mentioned. You're issue is almost identical to mine from what you have described.</p>

<p>Things I've tried to troubleshoot it:<br>- using different USB cables, makes no difference. Still intermittent functionality<br>- Try on Windows 7 laptop and a Mac OSX<br>- DFU start up and Flash rescue. Same problem as you where it comes out of DFU mode when I release S1. Managed to successfully complete it eventually but same issues persist.<br>- Disconnected all hardware from GPIOs. This made no difference but I'm actually happy about that. I was worried the knobs and LEDs I'd soldered together were the source of a grounding problem. Apparently not.<br>- Removed from Hammond enclosure</p>

<p>Some potential causes that I need to keep testing:<br>- I may have done some crappy soldering on the GPIO header and caused a short somewhere. I have a header strip soldered to the board and connect the knobs and LEDs with jumper leads.<br>- My board is bolted to a piece of perspex with rubber spacers between the board and the perspex. The perspex is then velcro'd to the hammond enclosure. I'm worried there is static building up on the perspex. Probably should have used wood instead.</p>

<p>Update:<br>In the 5 minutes while I've been typing this, the board no appears to have started working normally with a nice solid green LED. I'm so confused <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> </p>

<p>I'm determined to sort this out and would love to hear if you get to the bottom of it. Let me know if any of the info above is helpful or if you have any progress. I'll keep you updated from my side.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Same USB cable at both locations. It's actually the same cable I use for my working Axoloti at home. I have some other cables I can try. When I noticed the faint/semi-regular flickering of LED 1, the Axo was powered using a different cable connected to the AC adapter/powerstrip though. </p>

<p>I tried 2 different USB ports on the home computer, although they were both located on the front panel. I can try one of the back panel ones this evening.</p>

<p>Hmm. I'd like to try this, but I don't know if I have the appropriate AC adapter laying around. Also, I'm not sure if it is actually a USB power issue as it works fine connected to the PC at my office. </p>

<hr>

<p>I was successfully able to reflash the Axoloti at this office this morning again. I'm not heading back into work until Monday, so I guess I have to plan out what troubleshooting steps I attempt as I might only get "1 shot" if plugging the thing into my PC at home some how wipes the firmware. I have a start-up patch on an SD-Card, so my thought is to attempt to connect it just to a USB cable connected to an AC adapter first. If that works, then try connecting it to the PC again.</p>

<p>Keep throwing suggestions my way, I'm open to whatever.</p>

              <p>So the saga continues...</p>

<p>During my lunch break at the office I created a patch to make sure the presumably rescued Axoloti was functioning normally. I made it make some sound, etc. and everything worked great! I packed the thing up and brought it home thinking that I could mark this problem solved. However, when I plugged the thing into my computer at home, boom, dim red LED 1, not recognized by the PC. Gah!</p>

<p>I tried multiple times starting it up in DFU mode on my home PC and nothing popped up in terms of Windows finding devices and the patcher/Zadig seeing any DFU devices. One thing that I noticed this time around after I gave up on the PC is LED 1 appears to faintly/semi-regularly blink when connected to a USB cable that is plugged into an adapter/powerstrip.</p>

<p>I don't know what to do at this point other than trying to reflash it again at work? Even if that works that doesn't solve the issue I am experiencing at home.</p>

<p>Here are a few environmental factors that may contribute to this problem I guess:</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows 10 PC at work, Windows 7 PC at home (however I have another Axoloti that functions fine using the home PC).</li>
<li>Humidity/heat or something? My office air conditioning runs so cold that I'll occasionally have to run a space heater in the summer.</li>
<li>The bubblewrap that this thing was shipped in (and that I packed it in to travel to work)? Maybe static or something? I don't know, is this even a thing?</li>
</ul>

<p>Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>

              <p>So I was thinking about this while I was getting ready for work this morning. It occurred to me that I may need to continue to hold S1 through the entire "Flash (Rescue)" sequence even though the instructions don't explicitly say to do this. So I brought the board into work with me and gave it a whirl. </p>

<p>The PC at my office immediately recognized the bootloader USB device and installed the drivers. I was able to go through the whole sequence of replacing the bootloader driver with winusb and reflashing the flash with the patcher. While I haven't tried to make the Axoloti spit out any audio yet, I did create a simple patch to make the green LED flash at me to show that it was working. Everything appears to be fine, but I guess I'll have to do some additional testing at home this evening to confirm.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help everyone!</p>

<blockquote><p>No devices in DFU mode detected. To bring Axoloti Core in DFU mode, remove power from Axoloti Core, and then connect the micro-USB port to your computer while holding button S1. The LEDs will stay off when in DFU mode.</p></blockquote>
