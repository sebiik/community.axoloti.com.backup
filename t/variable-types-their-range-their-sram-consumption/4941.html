        <p>This is probably a stupid question, but since people here are so nice...</p>

<p>I am trying to squeeze the last bit of SRAM out of my axo. I suppose that choosing variables with as few bits as possible would be one way of doing that. But i noticed that e.g. switching from an "int" variable to an "int8_t" variable uses <em>more</em> SRAM than the other way around.</p>

<p>So if someone were kind enough to take the time and explain to me what the different int (and similar) variable types are ---int, int8_t, int16, uint and what have you--- and how they differ in terms of range and SRAM usage, that'd be sooo appreciated!</p>

        <p>hmm,  interesting question, and one id need to play with to give a good answer .. but some thoughts to give you something to look into...</p>

<p>I think the M4, being 32bit, uses 4 byte aligned data , <br>so by default, I think unpacked data , like an int8 would effectively use 32 bit anyway. (1 byte data, 3 byte pad, and perhaps also a performance penalty for conversion <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/frowningae52.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> </p>

<p>however, I think you can use packed structures to stop this(!?)</p>

<p>but Id need to check this, the best way to do this would be to check with structs, and do a sizeof.<br>( a simple type, wont tell you about memory wasted due to alignment)</p>

<p>anyway hopefully this gives you a few keywords to do a bit of research, as I don't have time at the moment.</p>

<p>(but also do check, that your quest for more ram, doesn't come at a cpu performance hit that's unacceptable for your need - this stuff is aligned by default for a reason <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> )</p>

        <p>Misaligned accesses (ie accessing a N bit variable on something other than a N bit memory boundary) tend to be either prohibited or slow, so compilers avoid generating them. As a consequence data structures are not packed- and if you don't arrange things efficiently the compiler will generate data structures with holes.</p>

<p>E.g.</p>

<p>BAD<br>struct {<br>a uint32_t,<br>b uint8_t,<br>c uint32_t,<br>d uint8_t,<br>e uint32_t,<br>}</p>

<p>GOOD:<br>struct {<br>a uint32_t,<br>c uint32_t,<br>e uint32_t,<br>b uint8_t,<br>d uint8_t,<br>}</p>

<p>The latter case uses less RAM for the same data. So that's one thing to watch out for. Use sizeof() to check.</p>

<p>Also - Compilers generally generate the most concise code when dealing with variables that match the natural word size of the CPU- so use something that makes life easy for the compiler.</p>

<p>BAD:<br>unsigned char i;<br>for (i = 0; i &lt; 100; i ++) {<br>// blah<br>}</p>

<p>GOOD:<br>int i;<br>for (i = 0; i &lt; 100; i ++) {<br>// blah<br>}</p>

<p>i is a stack variable - and is probably going to have the same stack usage in either case.<br>The code may be smaller (.text) because it's all 32 bit ops. ARM does have 8/16/32 bit ops,<br>so may do an ok job with this - but the point is that picking a local variable that is smaller in<br>size is really a no-op as far as data and code size go.</p>

<p>int<br>signed integer - size is compiler dependent, 32 bits on the ARM cortex M4<br>int8_t,int16_t,int32_t<br>These are also signed integers, but the size is explicit.</p>

<p>min_value = -(1 &lt;&lt; (n - 1))<br>max_value = (1 &lt;&lt; (n-1)) - 1<br>where n is the size in bits.</p>

<p>e.g. in python</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>n = 8<br>min_value = -(1 &lt;&lt; (n - 1))<br>print min_value<br>-128<br>max_value = (1 &lt;&lt; (n-1)) - 1<br>print max_value<br>127</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>BTW - if you really want to save RAM you should look at the *.map file and see where it's being used.<br>That'll tell you where you need to focus your efforts.</p>
