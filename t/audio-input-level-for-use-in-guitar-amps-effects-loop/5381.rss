    <title>Audio input level for use in guitar amp&#39;s effects loop</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/audio-input-level-for-use-in-guitar-amps-effects-loop/5381</link>
    <description>Hello everyone,
After some time with Axoloti, exploring the possibilities, I decided to make a guitar effecting unit to be used in the effects loop of my amplifier. But here I encounted first and quite serious problem. The signal from the amp is too hot and the input of Axoloti runs into clipping even when the gain in audio/inconfig is set to -12dB.
I am thinking of inserting an attenuatin pot before the input but I wander if the output of Axoloti is strong enough to get to the initial level? Or maybe there is another way to attenuate the input other than audio/inconfig?
If anyone used Axoloti for similar application, please, let me know how you solved this issue.
Thanks!</description>

              <p>Have a look at this thread, the OP Dan has tackled this issue with an additional board he was trying to gauge interest in the solution but the thread sort of fizzled out, might well be worth your while posting there if his take on it interests you.</p>

    Hello All! 

I made this: 



Is there any interest in me making this available?  It's all through hole, so it could be a kit.  Would just uploading the design files be good enough?  Questions, comments, criticisms, suggestions?    

If there's interest I might put more work into it, if there isn't interest then it is what it is. 

I might also think about making a "guitar pedal levels" board, as the requirements are a little different.
