    <title>Its all about the music (challenge)</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/its-all-about-the-music-challenge/3062</link>
    <description>lots of tech talk on the forum, anyone fancy a simple challenge to tip the balance the  other way a little ?

**Challenge**: make a &#39;piece&#39; of music using Axoloti 

any style, any duration... any definition of the term music :) 
submit as many as you have time for, but must be made between now and end date (15th March and 29th March) - no previously released stuff.

no votes this time, its all about sitting down and making some music, here and now with Axoloti.

**End date:** 29th March (two weeks from now)

**Restrictions:** just one, all sound generated and effects used must come from Axoloti, so you cannot use external synths or effects (software or hardware) - thats it.

to keep it as open as possible:

- you can use daws or other hardware for multi-tracking/loop/sequence/mixing or whatever
- you can use samples in axoloti
- as you can multi track, you can of course use as many axoloti patches as you wish

mixing, I guess we can allow some subtle eq/compression, but lets keep it subtle, unless its done in Axoloti, then it can be as wild as you like ;) 

this means no clever patching/programming is required, some simple axoloti patches are all you need, and you can glue it together with other tools you have.

of course, this is fully inclusive... if your thing is detailed patching/sound design/generative music, thats welcome too, whatever floats your boat.

**Submission:** post a link to soundcloud, you tube etc  in this thread.
please make sure its an embedded link, people are unlikely to want to start downloading, and visiting other sites.

if you wish, you can also share any patch or patches in the community library, but **this is not a requirement** for this challenge.

**Tips:**

- for those just starting out, the tutorial and demo patches give the basics for all you need for this challenge
- for those who may not have been keeping up with axoloti development, 1.0.12 introduced some new oscillators (brds) and effects (clds,rngs,lmnts)  - with these you can easily create nice effects and instruments e.g. a brds oscillator into a rngs/reverb, is simple but really effective, that anyone can patch in minutes
- the community library has a lot of objects covering many areas, just don&#39;t get overwhelmed in the choice.


Hopefully wherever you are on your Axoloti journey, you can join in and have some fun, and use it as an excuse to &#39;focus on the music&#39;

(any thoughts/suggestions, feel free to post below)</description>

<p>would really be great to see more axo users involved in these challenges, great way to learn, share, and balance the 'tech talk'</p>

    Fellowship of Axo - 1 of 2

Final submission date for part one: Thursday 13th April  (2 weeks from now) 

The "Fellowship of Axo" challenge centres on collaboration, exploring with others. Part one is about providing seeds of inspiration to other musicians, which they can plant and grow to fruition in part two. 

For this challenge, your task is to provide a seed of inspiration, something that can be used (and abused) in part two. To encourage participation, I'll keep it vague, but my ideas are

              <p>Yeah sorry. I mean 2:35 min. Anyway. Your contribution and that of Mathew basically prove that the Axoloti already ticks most boxes as far as my Holy Grail ideals (see thread) are concerned. His granulator and / or these modeling oscillators plus a fair bit of delay hanky panky between them and a "standard" subtractive final section should already come very close without me having to dive into C.</p>

<p>for sure, lots to still play with brds, has so many oscillator types, and I really only played with the more obvious ones, and not even touched layering, or crossfading (my favourite 'trick') with combinations... the cpu was nice and low, so  definitely lots of opportunities there.</p>

              <p>Yeah, those modeled brds oscillators are going to get a lot of attention from me. In that respect your tracks is a very good demo of the sort of stuff I hope the Axoloti can offer. The viola type sound starting at 1:00 min is a modeling giveaway. Such sounds are very difficult to do well with anyhting else then modeling. Off course there is sampling but then you only get pure imitations of real instruments and as remarked earlier I am more interested in the fifty shades inbetween (cuse me!) The sound I tried to point out earlier is the buzy one that starts at 2:20 min. Very nice!<br>Also love your jamy's and socks by the way.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/brasso">@brasso</a> which bit? Sorry, I put this together pretty quickly, basically they are simple all patches  brds oscillators into clds reverb... and some into a lp or comb filter on some-  I'd need to check. Then its just adjust params a bit, and scale x,y,z of soundplane into various params. As I said, quick simple stuff... often I prefer this over creating complex patches. (and maximizes resources I have for patch)<br>(I just switch between them all using program changes messages from the push2, using clip launch, again super easy, but very hands on)</p>

              <p>OK, after trying to do something different (and failed...) Here is an improvised track recorded last Saturday for the "Placard" festival. It was played and diffused live on the internet, and I was just one of the 25 different artists (we each had a 30 min time schedule). It was also diffused via headphones in a number of places around France.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=false&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F314678537&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;maxheight=166"></iframe>

<p>I am using 4 axoloti boards, in 3 different boxes. <br>The black box is running the usual granular sampler patch + a binaural bass sound (great for headphones). I had a microphone plugged into it, and made some sounds and notes with my mouth before it all get chopped up and out to our ears.<br>The Ribbon box has a patch that includes 4 delay lines fed with a selection of different oscillators, 8 different kind, selectable by the two buttons, and a reverb<br>The Keyboard Synth is two axoloti's. One for creating the sounds (where I can go up and down patches with two buttons), and the other is 6 different delay lines with volume, pan, reverb and variable delay length.</p>

<p>I just used a brickwall limiter while mixing the track, no extra effects or anything</p>

<p>I do recommend listening to the music before watching the 360° video, because it does get into the way of the experience, and also, sorry about the 1st minute of the video, I forgot to switch the camera on, so I filled it up with inverse footage. </p>

              <p>lots of tech talk on the forum, anyone fancy a simple challenge to tip the balance the  other way a little ?</p>

<p><strong>Challenge</strong>: make a 'piece' of music using Axoloti </p>

<p>any style, any duration... any definition of the term music <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> <br>submit as many as you have time for, but must be made between now and end date (15th March and 29th March) - no previously released stuff.</p>

<p>no votes this time, its all about sitting down and making some music, here and now with Axoloti.</p>

<p><strong>End date:</strong> 29th March (two weeks from now)</p>

<p><strong>Restrictions:</strong> just one, all sound generated and effects used must come from Axoloti, so you cannot use external synths or effects (software or hardware) - thats it.</p>

<p>to keep it as open as possible:</p>

<ul>
<li>you can use daws or other hardware for multi-tracking/loop/sequence/mixing or whatever</li>
<li>you can use samples in axoloti</li>
<li>as you can multi track, you can of course use as many axoloti patches as you wish</li>
</ul>

<p>mixing, I guess we can allow some subtle eq/compression, but lets keep it subtle, unless its done in Axoloti, then it can be as wild as you like <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> </p>

<p>this means no clever patching/programming is required, some simple axoloti patches are all you need, and you can glue it together with other tools you have.</p>

<p>of course, this is fully inclusive... if your thing is detailed patching/sound design/generative music, thats welcome too, whatever floats your boat.</p>

<p><strong>Submission:</strong> post a link to soundcloud, you tube etc  in this thread.<br>please make sure its an embedded link, people are unlikely to want to start downloading, and visiting other sites.</p>

<p>if you wish, you can also share any patch or patches in the community library, but <strong>this is not a requirement</strong> for this challenge.</p>

<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>for those just starting out, the tutorial and demo patches give the basics for all you need for this challenge</li>
<li>for those who may not have been keeping up with axoloti development, 1.0.12 introduced some new oscillators (brds) and effects (clds,rngs,lmnts)  - with these you can easily create nice effects and instruments e.g. a brds oscillator into a rngs/reverb, is simple but really effective, that anyone can patch in minutes</li>
<li>the community library has a lot of objects covering many areas, just don't get overwhelmed in the choice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully wherever you are on your Axoloti journey, you can join in and have some fun, and use it as an excuse to 'focus on the music'</p>

<p>(any thoughts/suggestions, feel free to post below)</p>
