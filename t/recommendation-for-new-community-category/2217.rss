    <title>Recommendation for new Community Category</title>

    <description>Another website forum that I tend to follow daily is the PJRC (Teensy) forums.  They have a forum category they call &quot;Project Guidance - Advice on project feasibility, which parts to use, how to accomplish it.&quot;   I cannot begin to tell you how much I have learned just from this forum category alone!   I really think the Axoloti forum could benefit from something like this.  It is obvious that Axoloti users and developers are embracing the open source nature established but an area for newbs like me to ask...&quot;Is this possible and if so what do I need to do to make it happen? would make things sweeter me thinks.</description>

              <p>Suppose you right regarding the Hardware category and I hadn't really looked at it from the perspective of maintaining forum "clutter".  Thanks for listening though!</p>

              <p>I think the Hardware category already fits this sort of questions nicely. It's easy to add categories, but hard to reduce afterwards. Unless there is more support for such a new category, I'll leave it as it is.</p>
