        <p>my only experience is compiling and running the patcher on a rasp pi 1..and it was baaaddddd. super slow, 100% cpu use all the time. Compiling took about 27 hours. I don't think i was doing anything wrong but, yeah..something to consider before diving in. If you have a raspberry try compiling the patcher for it.</p>

        <p>Im in the process of doing something similar : <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/axocube-project">http://community.axoloti.com/t/axocube-project</a></p>

<p>but Im not using the PI (even the PI2 I have) for patching, I see very little advantage to that, over a (even cheap) laptop, it won't be a nice experience. Instead I consider the PI as part of a 'performance setup' (at least initially) gluing things together that the Axoloti cannot currently do e.g. control multiple axolotis via usb hubs, other devices.</p>

<p>the low level USB protocol of axoloti could be used to still get the 'live' elements of the axoloti UI, Im actually reconsidering this approach at the moment with the Push 2 e.g. rather than driving the Push2 directly from the Axoloti, instead sending data back to the PI2, and then driving the Push2 from there.</p>

<p>(this has he the advantage I can have multiple Axolotis,  the Push2 and other devices all connected to the PI2 on a USB hub... and the control things centrally on the PI2)</p>

<p>can I ask, why the PI zero? rather than the PI2?  the later is a lot more powerful. <br>if I was planning on using a PI zero, Id probably still get a PI2 initially, develop the software on that, and then transfer it to the PI zero after... it would make development a much more pleasant experience.</p>

        <p>hmm, the PI zero has 1 usb device port (I think), so if your planning on connecting a keyboard/mouse/axoloti/master keyboard, your probably going to need a usb hub... where as the PI2 has 4 USB ports which perhaps  might be enough for your needs.</p>

<p>(you'll need keyboard/mouse if your planning on running the patcher)</p>

<p>If I get time I'll try the patcher on the PI2 but as I said I have my doubts.</p>

<p>anyway, lets us know how you get on, its an interesting project.</p>

        <p>It would be really cool to have a "plug and play" device that you could integrate the axoloti into to turn it into a completely stand alone device capable of being patched on the go. Integrate that with a midi keyboard, and you'd have a incredibly powerful sound creation tool.(not that the axoloti isnt already incredibly powerful, that goes without saying)<br>Id pay money for such a thing.</p>

<p>what would this look like, how would it be controlled?<br>what size display, mouse, keyboard?<br>... why is this better than a laptop?</p>

<p>Im genuinely interested, as Ive always kind of though this is pretty much a no-go, lets remember the nord modular also was patched on the PC.</p>

<p>the only viable patching solution I can think of would perhaps be an iPad?</p>

        <p>so you want to do patching (i.e. not just running a patch) on a touch screen...<br>dont you think it would have to be a pretty big screen to make it practical to drag wires from object outlets to inlets accurately... Ive not got particular large fingers, but I would have thought smaller that 15" would be pretty difficult.</p>

<p>of course, if you exclude patching, i totally agree, and that is what Ive been doing with the Push, and also planning for the display in my AxoCube project</p>

        <p>well, i suppose patching could be done without, perhaps simply using the touch screen to select which patches to load or some such instead.</p>

        <p>this is exactly what I do with the Push.... all parameters are controllable, presets selectable, and patches browsable/loading.   (I hope to add wave/sample selection as well) </p>

<p>this can all be done directly on the  axoloti, doesn't need a separate microcomputer like the PI<br>(its also the aim of axoloti remote) </p>

<p>the reason Im adding a PI is I want to control multiple axoloti at the same time, and so it makes sense to form a 'star' configuration, and having the axoloti as the master is problematic due to no hub support.<br>and currently it would be easier to add displays etc to the PI too.<br>(this is not to say you cannot use the axoloti as the master, and if the digital interface between boards becomes a reality, then this may become a desirable option) </p>

<p>of course, this is merely my thoughts, and is largely influenced by not wanting to do much hardware hacking on the axoloti, which perhaps could also offer other options.</p>

        <p>For me it would be nice to run the patcher on RPi 2 too. I've tried to compile it but there are some dependencies missing at Raspbian repos. Didn't spend so much time on it. Maybe when I'm done with the current build project.</p>

<p>I'm building the RPi 2 based 'workstation' with touchscreen. Main reason for building it is a <a href="http://www.quinapalus.com/goom.html" rel="nofollow">Goom synth</a> which will be controlled by touchscreen optimized Pure Data interface. Axoloti will serve as a master FX. Goom is polyphonic multi-timbral and have panning for each voice. With that I get two FX 'buses'. Of course, patching the Axo patch in advance and then just run it or control it remotely from Pure Data too will be sufficient. Yet it would be uber-cool to be able to patch Axoloti without any other computer. I'll have USB keyboard with trackpoint attached anyway.</p>

<p>I have the guts already working, and Axo is great as a modular FX unit.</p>

<p>Btw, RPi 2 is great for running SunVox. This is my previous RPi 2 project:<br>First demo<br></p><div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="HRfP_w4xWms" data-youtube-title="MoonBox - DIY Raspberry Pi 2 Synthesizer powered by SunVox Virtual Modular Music Studio" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>

Of course, patching the Axo patch in advance and then just run it or control it remotely from Pure Data too will be sufficient.
