    <title>Env/adsr behavior faulty</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/env-adsr-behavior-faulty/1778</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;m making a big brass patch with all the parameters mapped to my Keylab49 keyboard in conjunction with the Music Thing Axo Control. It&#39;s in my (qui) contrib folder &quot;patches for polysynths&quot; as &quot;brass voice ctrl.axs&quot;

The problem is noticeable with the filter envelope. When i have a slow attack it opens the filter. But a fast attack doesn&#39;t open the filter at all. It should go through both attack and decay stages and sit at sustain level. I have the same sustain set and get differend held filter cutoff values depending on the attack setting, which is not the way traditional analog adsrs work</description>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/users/thetechnobear">@thetechnobear</a>, Now something else has happened. As I'm adding the controls I want for my Axo Control, suddenly the main patch goes into horrid feedback (careful testing!), even though when I make the patcher go live on its own it works fine. Any ideas? I put the file with the same name you used in my qui folder, by itself outside, in case you have a moment to check it out <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=2" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Wow Mark, thanks a lot for such a prompt and complete reply!<br>Your edit of my patch works perfectly, it does not present the issue I was experiencing, so I guess the problem was in my patch, possibly something to do with the execution order? (i'm a hardware modular patcher, we don't worry about such things, lol)<br>Thanks for showing me the patcher object, I really was wondering how to apply just global effects to a poly patch!<br>Total coolness, thanks again <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=2" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>I'll continue my work from your edit<br>Cheers!</p>

              <p>Ive just tested your patch and seems fine to me, I'll come back to this in a moment.</p>

<p>here, Ive re-arranged your patch a bit, as I think it might help you in the future</p>

<p>(actually, I'll say I tested the re-arranged one, but its basically the same, but I need to first be able to clearly see what was going on)</p>

<p>changes:<br>a) first , Ive cut n pasted your voice patch, into an embedded patcher object, they are easier generally to manage,<br>so we only have 1 file to deal with <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=2" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>b) Ive moved the effects out of the voice, and use an audio outlet<br>this is important, since effects are quite expensive, so unless you are doing per voice modulation, really you do not want 7 copies running.<br>(i.e. you'll get more polyphony with my patch)</p>

<p>c) execution order.<br>its really important you use the correct execution order, layout object left to right, top to bottom.<br>if not you can get weird issues,<br>note how in my layout all inlets are fed by an object that is processed first (L-&gt;R , T -&gt; B) </p>

<p>d) I pushed some params to the parent so i could test it easier</p>

<p>now for testing... <br>ok, so you can modify the parameters on the top level patch.<br>seeing an min attack, and a half sustain level, I can clearly hear the filter envelope working<br>i turned down the filter response to velocity and your lfo, so as to be sure by velocity did not alter the cutoff.<br>(as your effectively summing them with a mixer)</p>

<p>if you want to be even more sure, if you edit the sub-patch, change the adsr for the amp to -64,-64,64,-64, <br>then you will clearly here the filter envelope</p>

<p>hope the above helps<br>enjoy<br>Mark</p>
