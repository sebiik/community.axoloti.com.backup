<blockquote><p>The question is exactly how much should be cut from the base module and move to expansion modules. I think the base module should be actually usable without soldering, so maybe Micro USB power/data and host like the Pi Zero, SD card and 3.5mm in and out. Should the headphone jack stay on the base or can it be cut? Another issue: I'd like the base module to be purely surface mount components, again visualize the scale of the Pi Zero for comparison.</p></blockquote></aside>

        <p><a class="mention" href="../../u/blindsmyth-2.html">@Blindsmyth</a> I was considering that exact idea of switching between hp and line out. I would be all for it if there was an intuitive way to prevent confusion. It would be cool if it just did "the right thing" kind of like plugging a cell phone's 3.5mm into headphones vs into line in. But again adding that complexity to a known working design is tricky. We want this first version to be as drop in compatible as possible with the existing software stack.</p>

<p>What's strange and confusing about the current design is that the TPA6132A2 IC which is actually marketed as a headphone amplifier is driving the line out. The codec itself has a separate headphone output that drives the headphone out. The TPA is there in the name of ground loop protection according to previous forum posts. I'm not convinced that this is really needed strictly. It ends up being used basically for differential to single ended conversion. The dev board for the ADAU1961 does line in and out directly from the codec which can do single ended line out by itself (and runs off of USB power). I want to actually test if I can produce excessive ground loop noise using a design with just the codec. Might be able to cut out an IC completely.</p>

<p>BTW: I think the base module should be at least useable for basic output without soldering. I don't think it's reasonable to expect every user to solder on a connector.</p>

<p>That sounds reasonable. I think with micro usb / 2mini jacks one could create something that is very tiny and covers the basics. I do think though that the usb (and the audio ports) should also be accessable via pin headers though. It really bothers me that you can't do this for the usb ports with the current board.</p>

<p>You are in a way right about this, but non nerds are intimidated by bare boards. They want the thing at least in an enclosure and/or knobs buttons already included.

        <p>Ah ha! Volca is a great example. That is exactly what we want. I think I might have one lying around somewhere. I'll try to take a look to see if I can figure out what their approach is and what kind of performance they're getting out of the single output. There are going to be many possible ways to achieve that kind of result. We're pretty much stuck with our ADAU codec for now so I'm going to try to figure out the simplest way to do it with what the codec provides and minimal extra hardware.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/sonoptik-2.html">@Sonoptik</a> I have a complete layout and BOM of a prototype design for this that I did a year ago or so, so I'm not starting from scratch. I need to incorporate some of the things we're talking about and make sure everything is current. I'm busy with another project but I going to try to fit it in in the next couple weekends or so.</p>

        <p>A bare board should be as bare as possible, then simple Axoshields could be added to break out extra functions with the official IO for those who don't want to solder.<br>For example, how simple could a shield be just for adding Audio in out and head phones and still be very portable.</p>

        <p>Speaking as a non-nerd, (or more correctly, a nerd with no electronics skills!) I'd like things as simple as possible. My axoloti build approach was: stick it in a box and plug in some midi controllers. The thought of even having to solder some midi sockets on begins to put me off, though would be doable. So the more 'ready for use' it is initially, the more it appeals to me.</p>

<p>But I realise I'm probably in the minority as most seem to be making amazing hardware with it, and I can see the appeal of a cut down version for that. I guess I just want more of the same, so hopefully Johannes will be in stock again...</p>

        <p>I love axoloti the way it is now; the Arduino approach to digital music instruments and sound manipulation. Absolutely does the job for me at the moment. Especially the possibility to easily make inputs for pretty much every signal from knobs, switches, sensors and controllers. An update of the hardware would be nice for now. In the future I might desire a more powerful axoloti with more I/O.</p>

<p>Other than that, I hoped new boards would be in stock by now. I'm leaving next week to Jakarta and had promised to bring one to the art collective Forum Lenteng. A bit disappointing I won't be able to get it now, especially since I live around the corner from Johannes. Maybe next time in Ghent?</p>
