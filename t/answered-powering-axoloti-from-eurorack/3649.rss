    <title>[Answered] Powering Axoloti from Eurorack</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/answered-powering-axoloti-from-eurorack/3649</link>
    <description>We should probably have a definitive Eurorack thread somewhere. 

Anyways, I&#39;ve been looking at the best ways to power a hybrid synth with Axoloti providing multiple sound engines that run through an analog filter driven by an analog ADSR. Most designs I&#39;m looking at are +/-12v, so I&#39;ve built a Eurorack power supply. 

Am I going to have to step down both the positive and negative voltage rails? Or am I fine to connect to either  positive and ground or ground and negative. I don&#39;t totally understand how this aspect of electronics work, and couldn&#39;t find any solid explanations on the forum. 

From what I understand, the second option gives me 12v which fits into the 7-15v range for the DC input.

              <p>You should connect Axoloti to +12V and ground (0V). Avoid using -12V.<br>Also take in account the power consuption, If I remember correctly Axoloti alone consumes about 100mA, but if you want to connect something at the USB port, the consuption could rise up to 500mA, wich may be too much for your Eurorack Power Supply.</p>

              <p>Haven't looked at powering axo from eurorack yet but definitely think there should be a eurorack integration thread somewhere.</p>

<p>My plans for axo include it being at the core of one or more eurorack modules.</p>
