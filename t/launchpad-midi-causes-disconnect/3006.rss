    <title>Launchpad midi causes disconnect</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/launchpad-midi-causes-disconnect/3006</link>
    <description>Hi All,

I am working with a Launchpad mini. I&#39;m trying to send it simple midi notes to light up the pads. I&#39;ve used &#39;rbrt/launchpad/matrix disp&#39; for testing and it works great! I can light pads on the grid just fine.

I&#39;d prefer to just send the device midi messages manually, so I can have a little more flexibility. 

The trouble is - Whenever I start a patch that sends midi messages to the launchpad, the launchpad does not respond to any midi input. When I take the patch offline, the axoloti console reports &#39;disconnect request&#39; and I have to restart everything manually. It will not reconnect until I pull the USB cord out, re-insert and restart the patcher.

Is there a secret to sending midi to the launchpad that doesn&#39;t lock everything up? rbrt&#39;s custom objects are communicating with it just fine. The midi implementation for the launchpad specifies &quot;Launchpad uses a low-speed version of USB. A limitation of this is that it accepts a maximum of 400 messages per second.&quot;
Do I need to speedlimit the outgoing midi?

Thanks kindly</description>
