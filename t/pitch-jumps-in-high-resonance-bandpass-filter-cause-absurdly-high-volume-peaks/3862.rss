    <title>Pitch jumps in high-resonance bandpass filter cause absurdly high volume peaks</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/pitch-jumps-in-high-resonance-bandpass-filter-cause-absurdly-high-volume-peaks/3862</link>
    <description>Here&#39;s an issue that&#39;s been plaguing one of my patches: When a voice jumps from high to low, it blows out the speakers. (OK I&#39;m exaggerating, but it&#39;s still hilariously loud.) Obviously something is wrong with the filter.

Here&#39;s an audio recording: https://instaud.io/1mny
In it, I show that dragging up and down the keyboard has no effect, but jumping from high to low causes the peaks depending upon distance traveled.
I&#39;ve also reduced the patch down to a mostly bare-bones reproduction of the issue: https://my.mixtape.moe/qjtecc.axp


Windows 10
Direct USB
Board 1.2, build 1.0.12-0-g80370d2
For the record, I&#39;m using the headphone jack.</description>
