    <title>Delay Buffer Playback Rate (Lowering Pitch)</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/delay-buffer-playback-rate-lowering-pitch/5738</link>
    <description>Apologies if someone&#39;s cracked this already, but I&#39;m curious if anyone has a patch that changes the delay buffer playback rate so that whatever is stored is played back at a slower speed and thus a lower pitch, similar to how some table read objects have pitch control. I&#39;m trying to replicate the sound of a slowed-down record player for sampling purposes without needing to worry about writing, stopping, and starting a table. The delay read objects only seem to have control over the total length of the buffer, not how quickly it is read through; I can see how trying to play the buffer at a faster rate than it&#39;s sampling would pose a problem (it can&#39;t see into the future after all), but because it&#39;s playing back data it&#39;s already stored, this seems like it should be possible. Any patches, tips, or thoughts would be greatly appreciated!</description>

              <p>I think the parameter you mean is the time inlet on the delay read?<br>That doesn't change the size of the buffer, it changes (delays) the playback position relative to the delay write's write position.</p>

<p>I made a kind of pitch drop/record stop type patch a while back using tables, maybe it'll help. When you hit the button it starts recording and immediately starts playing back whilst still recording, with an envelope on the playback speed. </p>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/u/khs">@KHS</a><br>I want to build a similar patch and was wondering if you could solve this in the meantime?<br>It should write into ram, and play the same ram slower while still writing.</p>

<p>I build some delay units with /write and /read objects, also using the pot for buffer lenght (but to be honest i still didÂ´nt discover exactly what this parameter does).</p>
