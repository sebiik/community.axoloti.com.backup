<p>Pardon? what are you talking about, I'm not offended , just expressing my opinion, if that's ok by you?</p>

<p>Of course you are right about DACs and software and no I haven't done a side by side comparison but I'm not paying that much to try. </p>

<p>Organelle may suit your needs but axo suits mine more despite it's limitations, i think. It seems more flexible, much cheaper and the software is ready to go and easy to learn so you get results sooner. It not being in an enclosure also enables it to be used in many different ways where the knobs and buttons on the organelle are not needed.</p>

<p>I have looked at some of the alternatives you suggest here and think Axo is perhaps the best value and most flexible solution available.</p>

<p>Why could it not be possible to make different products aimed at different markets at some time in the future?</p>

<p>I agree about pure data, If I was going to do that sort of thing on a computer I'd just do it in C/C++, the only hard part would be accessing the hardware but SDL can probably do that reasonable easily, I know it has audio capability, dunno about MIDI.</p>

<p>I guess some of my criticisms and minor frustrations with Axoloti come from it being so close to exactly what I had in mind myself apart from a few niggling details, you know that so close but not quite feeling you get about things that could be so great but just miss the mark by a bit? that's how I feel about Axo.</p>

<p>Just because I criticise it and offer suggestions for improvements and future developments doesn't mean I don't like it, in fact the opposite is true, as good as it is, it can be better and I want to help make it better.</p>

<p>Does that clarify things a bit?</p>

              <p>(removes mod hat, dons lover of small musical devices hat)</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/strum">@strum</a>, I understand your viewpoint, and how things are not meeting your criteria... but there are lots of market segments out there, different musicians, different needs.<br>lets remember, there are some great musicians producing great music with tools of much lower specs than axoloti , organelle or a.n.other ... its not the tools, its what they do with them.</p>

<p>thats not to say any of these meet your (or other musicians) requirements., e.g. Im sure many professional studios have exacting requirements, that mean they won't use these technologies. <br>But its probably fair to say, these products are not aimed at these markets.<br>as always, commercially there is a balancing act,  which is where target market/price points become important...<br>you may be willing to pay (e.g.) $50 more for x,y,z... but how does that affect the rest of the target market? perhaps they are not. at which point its the manufacture (who takes the product/investment risk) who has to decide, what is IN and what is OUT.</p>

<p>Organelle - I also love, and actually regret that I dismissed it early on... (see  my early comments in this thread) <br>although I recognised it then as a 'complete package', it wasn't until I got one, I really realised how important that was, and what it opened up.</p>

<p>Specs do not tell the whole story... with digital instruments, a lot is about the software that is run on them, you can write bad dsp algo at high sample rates/bit depths, and it will still alias/sound horrible.<br>similarly whilst I prefer an RTOS, if you are careful with non-RTOS they can still perform... which we already rely on for PC/Mac etc - but sure you have to be careful, and it depends on your needs.</p>

<p>as for Pure Data, again, Ive been relatively critical in other thread (search Pure Data), I do agree, I think generally the patching environment is not as good as Axoloti, and just has a more technical feel...  (I think like Max is to say Reaktor).<br>also writing 'native objects' (aka externals) is no where near as easy as Axoloti.<br>however, there is no doubt its just as flexible as Axoloti, and has the benefit of 100's of externals that have been written for it... which cover just about everything <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  ... also there is a reasonably large healthy community to help out.... and its cross platform, which aids patch development a lot.</p>

<p>overall i think PD is far from perfect, but like any tool, once you get to know it... its plenty powerful enough for the job. (and if your going to start doing powerful DSP, heavy lifting... your going to be writing it in C/C++, then the 'object wrapper' becomes largely irrelevant) </p>

<p>the other options are: <br>Bela... this might work for you,  certainly its got an RTOS ( IF you are careful with software), and low latency.<br>however, the software/support etc, I personally don't think matches Axoloti. It gives lots of choices, but then leaves you to find the right route , perfect for low level guys (Ive got 3 <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ) , but not so great for beginners.<br>I personally thing its target market is instrument makers.<br>(see other Bela thread in Lounge, and discuss further there)</p>

<p>rPI3 + PiSound... the rPI needs a sound card, and I like the PI Sound to give me that, in a compact format.<br>(there are other soundcards around though, e.g. hifi berry, but pi sound gives you gain controls and midi din)<br>but its using a RTOS, so for instrument making, latency <strong>might</strong> play a factor...<br>also, whilst theres a bit of a music making community with the rPI, its a bit sparse, so again, it tends to feel like your doing it on your... again, cool if your into low level stuff, but not so great if you just want to plug in, patch and make music.<br>(see other rPI thread in Lounge, and discuss further there)</p>

<p>other options are things like Mod DUO, OWL ... which Ive not had hands on experience with, but might be worth exploring.</p>

<p>as for other technologies, I suspect in this sub-$1000 range your going to find it hard to get what you want,  perhaps look at the old Nord G2 , or Kyma ($$$$)</p>

<p>anyways, they all have their strengths/weaknesses... there markets... either with limited budgets, limited time, limited experience... I encourage/support them all, the more options out there, the more likely we will get better derivatives in the future.</p>

<p>anyway, I hope you find what your looking for.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/gavin">@Gavin</a><br>I am happy, I payed around 340 dollars for mine <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  </p>

<p>But saying that one saves a lot of money is not always entirely true. Cause most of the times you need a lot more than just the Pi3 to make a sound device. For example an audio hat of good quality easily cost 100-200$. You can get a lot cheaper audio interfaces so there is something to save there.. But then if you also need a bunch of knobs too and other things, like display if you wan to interact with it without a regular computer display. Eventually the PI3 build I was working on enden up costing more than I payed for the Organelle. So I put the Pi3 build on hold and instead bought the organelle. But still plan to make the Pi3 build later on.</p>

<p>16 bit 44.1 is more than enough. </p>

<p>I have got an couple of Axolotis and I have had them for a few years now. I have also got an Organelle. And my opinion based on listening tests and actually listening to both devices, the sound in Organelle is of better quality. Have you tested them next to each other?</p>

<p>Another ting is how good an audio device sounds isnt necessarily only reliant on the sample and bit rate, but probably more on the quality of the dac being used. There are many things playing a role here, so saying 16 48 is better than 16 44,1 is not really a 100% true.</p>

<p>I have not said it was intuitiv, I said that Pure Data is reliant on the computer you run it ons processor. Hence you can load a lot more, hence you can go deeper and explore synthesis like FFT and phase vocoding. You can't do that in Axoloti cause it doesnt have the amount of DSP or memory needed. Again, I am just saying my needs have exceedes what is possible with Axoloti and therefor need to try something else. And PD can, from what I learned by now, do anything I want. It might look "simple" but it is super complex and you need to work for it <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>It runs linux and linux is not a real time OS, and is a massive unnecessary processing and maintenance overhead.</p>

<p>Just a 5 second look at the thing tells me it's not what I want,  Axo, for all it's faults, is much more flexible and extendable</p>

<p>I had a brief look at pure data, it's even uglier looking than Axo, nowhere near as intuitive to use and doesn't appear to have a fraction of the available modules for Axo. Pass.</p>

<p>Wrong. As it runs Pure Data it can do a lot more than Axoloti can, cause Pure Data is many years old and have been developed for a lot longer time than Axo has. </p>

<p>Yeah, some things take time. As I said, the things I want to do, cannot be done on Axoloti because of its low DSP power. If Axoloti had a lot more power it would be great, but it doesnt, so for me personally it is a natural progression to move on to something that can do the things I want to do.   I think that is a fair and a personally choice.</p>

<p>I do think Axo has been a big learning experience. But I just feel like I wont learn much more if I stay on this platform, so of course I am going to try something new <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>So it is basically up to you what you want to run it on. There are also dedicated devices that runs Pure Data, like Organelle. Just got an Organelle a few days ago and on this I can finally make full arrangements on a single device. Couldnt do that on Axoloti, so I am really happy about this.</p>

<p>Pure Data can also run on a Raspberry Pi if you like. So it is really up to the user and be creative and build what you want <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>i would be most interested in analog in to analog out with a simple adc~ dac~ connection in puredata. should be fairly easy to measure and i can get a pretty good idea from there <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> midi in to audio out depends on a lot of stuff, that is true. maybe usb midi (not din) with a simple synth patch in puredata to analog out. do you have an oscilloscope? that would make things much easier.</p>

<p>thanks for investigating and looking forward to the results, wondering if my friend got his measurements right!</p>

<p>will do, though at the moment Im either spending my time just playing it ... or trying to work out what makes it tick (software, codec, arch linux setup etc) </p>

<p>latency will be a bit tricky.<br>guess the best is to measure RTT on ADC&lt;- PD -&gt; DAC as thats what most users are using it for, when using effects. </p>

<p>then there is midi latency, I could do an RTT, but thats fraught with issues e.g. latency in the loopback device, the connection method (e.g. if I use a USB midi din converter that is going to be slower than USB to USB) - so not really sure the best way to do this, to get a fair measurement.<br>what I would be more interested in is jitter for midi.</p>

<p>... and of course, using PD, would not be as quick as using alsa directly from C++ etc, so not strictly a test of the hardware, rather the normal 'users experience'</p>

<p>I wil say so far, as an instrument it seems fine... and even when using it as a send effect it sounded good... now that may be as i was tending to play with reverbs/delays so of course, latency is not a big issue.... <br>(and of course with FX, you can select wet/dry... so I can select full wet, and let the mixer give me the dry mix)</p>
