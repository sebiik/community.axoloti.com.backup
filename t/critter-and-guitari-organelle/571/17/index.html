        <p>Yeah, its not really like axoloti... more like OWL which also uses compiled PD stuff.<br>the advantage of Axoloti is its using an RTOS, and is creating native code... so pretty efficient, and also a lot more open (hardware etc).</p>

<p>be interesting to see their pricing, their other stuff is pretty expensive (I think).</p>

<p>still looks nice though <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

        <p>seems to be released now...</p>

<p>and a nice cute video : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6FAxLFzLk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW6FAxLFzLk</a></p>

<p>from an independent standpoint, and thinking what axoloti can learn from it...</p>

<p>Basically PI2 + audio card + display/knobs... which is quite attractive, if your not into hardware building <br>$500, seem expensive, but perhaps not if you start comparing to something like an OP-1<br>Looks good quality<br>Keyboard, completes the product, not great, I doubt its velocity sensitive... appears to be useable for sequencing too... pity not 16 'white' keys<br>pity it is not battery powered, I assume you can power from USB<br>seems to be running Linux + pd vanilla <br>they appear to expose Linux, so you can do what you want (HDMI , USB keyboard/mouse)<br>pity they choose not to include ethernet port, but you could use a wireless dongle.</p>

<p>other elements:<br>forum - they also use a discourse forum, seems not to active currently, but only been released for a few days.<br>patch library - they have a patch library, but not currently for their content, looks like some good patches to start users off (not heard anything great yet) ... aimed at end user.</p>

<p>Overall I think its nice... aimed at musicians, a complete package, just plug n play, download some patches from the library and go... its a compelling proposition, Id be tempted as an alternative to the OP-1... but only if someone can prove it can sound fantastic.</p>

        <p>From listening to the examples it sounds pretty decent to me <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>But Axoloti is to me way more user friendly(Not have to use PD to build your own patches). I am happy bout my choice about Axoloti... But yeah, some knobs and buttons and a display for axoloti would be nice.. Maybe even a tiny oscilloscope, like on the new Korg Minilogue <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>Think it is about time to experiment with that soon....</p>

        <p>I don't see PD as a disadvantage at all... except perhaps for efficiency, though the A9 is pretty powerful.<br>(leaving aside arguments of Linux/RTOS)</p>

<p>Sound... It was okay, but I didn't hear anything that sounded different, just sounded like another digital synth. I think these things need something that gives them their own character. or in this case, exploits its 'modular' approach perhaps?</p>

<p>Ive no regrets on buying into Axoloti either... <br>I just like to keep an open mind on alternatives, also seeing where they are going, perhaps inspire too... learn from each other....<br>and I do like these 'complete products' ... Id have bought an Axoloti with case/knobs/display in a heartbeat, but I do recognise many others here, prefer the bare board approach.</p>

        <p>I think its because I dont know PD <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> Axoloti has a familiar interface to Reaktor, And nord modular series, which are the ones that I am familiar with. But PD is very much fun to play with. Only getting started with it. </p>

<p>Sound... Yeah maybe it is mot much differen than others. Only listened on laptop speakers and didnt compare it to anything else... But Axoloti... <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> When using 1 cycle wavetables instead of oscillators... It just gives you sooo many different characters. I sampled all my synths oscillators one by one, Waldorf, Micro Q + Blofeld, Nord Nm1+G2, and made a bunch in Serum, Sound forge... And it is pretty nice when you have a bunch of them, to switch between them and see how much the character of the sound actually changes. Some are deep and a bit saturated and other more flat..Lots of character there.. I Almost never use regualr oscillators anymore, not on any of my synths. But I know this is also possible in PDm anyway. But Axoloti is less difficult to me atleast <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>Wondering about character in other stage than the oscillators.. Like for example "sampling" filters(I guess that is convolution then). Would be awesome to for example have the oscialltor from Nord G2 and the filter from Waldorf Micro Q and etc.. <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> Build a super synth.</p>

<p>About alternatives: Yeah there are so many things out there...I promised myself I cant buy more gear for a long time so trying to focus on what I have and tweek everything out of it <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> A few knobs I am allowed to buy, but nothing mayor..</p>

<p>Anyway, should make that tutorial on making one cycle wavetable soon I mentioned earlier.. It is easy to do and can be done with freeware program and gives Axoloti a whole new dimension.</p>

<p>me too, but ...</p>

<p>actually, I think I'm suffering a bit from overload, what with trying to make music, programming stuff... the 'incomplete' hardware side is frustrating me a bit (no cases, etc) ... Axoloti just has so many customisation possibilities, along with my other projects it just a bit to much for me ... a plug in a go platform is pretty attractive right now.</p>

<p>of course adding yet another box... is not gonna help those issues <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>I think i just need to find a better short term solution to making my axolotis more accessible, and so more enticing to turn on an tinker with.</p>

<p>definitely would love to see you wavetable stuff... I can completely see how some characterful oscillators would add a lot, its possibly something I'm missing ... and yes, I think the filter stage would be the obvious next stage. <br>(and then a nice reverb, a flexible, nice sounding reverb... Id dedicate an axoloti for that!)</p>

        <p>Yeah I think Ill wrap up a "wavetable one cycle simple synth" patch and a little tutorial on how to prepare files. Should have done it long time ago... Will look into it.</p>

<p>It is not that I dont like Axolotis oscillators, but I just like that wavetables(atleast blofeld and Q does and I think I also got it working in axoloti now)  are ALWAYS retriggered when you hit a note on the keyboard.. Especially for kick and bass. Or else you can experience clicks when the note triggers the wave in the middle of a cycle.</p>

        <p>My opinion is biased obviously, I think a major thing it is missing is the ability to edit patches from a PC. Shuffling around a usb stick, hmmm. Reconnecting your desktop keyboard/mouse/screen is annoying. <br>The OLED display looks incredibly tiny to me, like you need a magnifier glass to read 6 lines of text.<br>I also don't understand the argument for the maple key keyboard.</p>

<p>I feel the same as you about the "incomplete" side. I think it would be fantastic to have the Axoloti Control. I know there are a few DIY guys that will not be interested in it, but for the rest of us, not so used to DIY, would make us very happy. I am ready to spend some money to get the Axoloti more accesible.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, I am very happy with the Axoloti. And a lot of time is just my lazyness:grinning: We have an active forum and many people happy with to help and of course we have Johannes and a few more that are working hard to improve the software with a lot of firmware updates in little time.</p>

<p>The sensation of finished product is what I would learn from the Organelle. You have knobs, buttons and display in a small compact package, ready to play from day 1. You even have a web to listen and download new patches.</p>

        <p>USB stick, a bit of an odd decision... probably to avoid connectivity issues, its an easy solution-  I guess.</p>

<p>they do mention USB wifi dongle on the forum... actually, it sounds like if you have some skills with Linux, you will be able to treat it as a Linux box, so do what you wish - but theres not alot of info on that side at the moment.<br>(e.g. it has a HDMI output, and USB keyboard/mouse... can you edit on the box itself?  perhaps even just do a remote X session) </p>

<p>as for editing, well, I guess you prototype with PD on a PC/Mac first no... so only need to transfer when finished. <br>(Ive actually no issue with that workflow... has the advantage you can test without the board attached)</p>

<p>OLED... yeah pretty small, but I guess probably not far off the OP1 size, I dont think you need much, its just parameter,patch and menu selections. <br>Keyboard, seems to be part of their brand... again bit like the OP1, nice to have something you can play on the road... or when you dont want to have all your gear around.  (thats why the battery power is a key missing element!)</p>

<p>Id guess opinions will be divided... axoloti is the ultimate hackable board for music, both hardware and software... perhaps the Organelle is 'less hardcore' , gives you the modular synth, but in a fixed hardware format.</p>

<p>Of course, I hope Axoloti Remote can bridge that gap, make it more accessible to those that dont have the time/skills for hardware hacking (and yes, are willing to pay extra for that privilege <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> )</p>

        <p>looks like overpriced geekware to me but i might be wrong. on the other hand id love pd integration on the axoloti because i have so much already finished in pd which i have to redo now ... also i dont think anything can match the depth of pd and you need that depth often to cover new grounds.</p>

        <p>Organelle and Axoloti are both flexible tools, platforms for which you can test the limits of your imagination and ingenuity. However, Organelle is a bit overpriced in regards to what it is and does... but it does come with a case, a screen, inputs, and I am assuming packaging, and all of that stuff adds up. Just imagine what our beloved Axo would have cost us if johannes shipped these guys with anything but the board.</p>

        <p>Keyboard is good as a destination instrument...  Huge user base.<br>But I want to make new instruments.<br>Still wood is good tho not just for hipsters <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Editing patches axo/uModu/Reaktor style is best.<br>Having a hardcore community like Axo is bester.</p>
