    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/proper-tablet-reading-for-wavetable-synths/499</link>
    <description>Hi - so after thinking everything is pretty cool sounding, I started looking at the details of my instrument. Although happy accidents are great, I don&#39;t want to stay ignorant of how to properly do something.

What I am doing is playing back a table that has a sample loaded into it.

Here are my issues:

1. I am using a Phasor to play it back since I want pitch variation. The phasor seems to be flipping the sample waveform - perhaps it should be a rising saw instead of a falling saw? Placing a math invert object before the phasor goes into the table read object doesn&#39;t produce any sound at all from the table.
** inverting after the table seems to work fine!

2. The Memory allocation for the table doesn&#39;t make sense to me. If the sample is 1186 bytes - shouldn&#39;t I allocate more bytes than that to the table? I am thinking since my wav is a 16bit 48khz sample, I create a 16bit table. I figure the numbers in the drop down are bytes. So i give it 2048 bytes. I incorrectly (i guess) assumed that the table is now about half full and when I run a phaser through it, it will output all of the values and once it reaches and empty value it will start from the begining. Not sure where I got that assumption but it seems wrong. I can see on an oscilloscope that theres a big gap until the sample waveform starts up again. Interestingly, giving the table 1024 bytes, seems to fit the sample as well, and the gap is smaller. 512 bytes seems to almost correctly fill the table but theres some weird waveform mangling at the start of the sample. 
***what I really dont get is if the sample is 1186 bytes, and i allocate memory for it as a 1024 table..why is there still a gap when i play it back with a phasor. Shouldn&#39;t it actually be without a silent gap since the whole table is already full since i tried to load a 1186 byte sized amount of data?

3. The waveform mangling that happens at the beginning of the sample wave form while using a phasor - is this something to do with the phasor? Is it bandlimited or something?</description>

<p>i came here via search but found that actually 64 = 100% so if you want 50% through the table you need 32.</p>

              <p>8  kilo bytes might be short but it is fine here. I know on Blofeld they are made of 128 waves of 64 sample length, so they are much longer.</p>

<p>Anyway try yourself. Here is the patch I am working on. I have included the .raw file used and also the wavefile before it is converted to raw.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> Please take a look at the indexing of the table. If you scan through the wavetable the first 11 tables should be different than the rest. From 12 and up it is the same stativ saw wave. So if you want to check if indexing is correct you can check if  selecting wave 12 and up changes the sound alot. You can check the wavefile in wave editor.</p>

<p>Link for patch and samples. I think it is pretty good as it is now, but should probably be setup in a different way. I used table play pitch cause I need to be able to select position(wavetable). Any updates and help is welcome. WOuld be really awesome too get this right <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

              <p>Yes I am pretty sure. From Serum manual page 11:</p>

<p>Edit i mean 8 kilobyte</p>

<p>The wavetables in Serum consist of up to 256 sub-tables, or single-cycle<br>waves which will be referred to hereafter as frames. This is probably best thought of as (up to) 256 discrete waveforms, which are joined together end-to-end in the parent file on disk.In normal circumstances you hear one of these 256 tables at a time, but you can automate (using the WT Pos knob) to have the sound 'animate' though various tables. Technically it<br>is possible to hear multiple tables simultaneously, by enabling Unison<br>(for multiple simultaneous voices) and the Unison WT Pos control (to<br>have said multiple voices play different sub-tables, see Global settings<br>chapter for more on this control).</p>

<p><strong>Technically speaking, when Serum loads a wavetable it is using 2048</strong><br><strong>samples for a sub-table of the wavetable set. This means the</strong><br><strong>maximum file size would be 2048(samples) x 256(sub-tables) x 32(bits)</strong><br><strong>(which is exactly 2 megabytes).</strong></p>

<p>Most wavetable files won't be this large however. It is common to have<br>a good sounding wavetable which may consist of just a few sub-tables.</p>

<pre><code></code></pre>

<p>From serum manual page 13:<br>While this uses hard disk space (how much size depends on how many frames you<br>use in the Wavetables, from <strong>8k to 4 Megabytes)</strong> the benefit is that you<br>can exchange presets with others, or open your song in the future,<br>without having to worry about table file management. so there is no<br>need to save wavetables unless you want your wavetable to appear in<br>the Wavetable Menu.</p>

              <p>Yes you can make serum files any size between 8 byte and 2048 bytes(2megabyte).  Serum waves are 8 bytes long each and</p>

<p>The example I have posted and made is based on a 128 wavetable and each wavetable is 4 bytes. SOOO </p>

<p>128 wavetables * 4 bytes = is 512 bytes. </p>

<p>Therefor in my head the Table//alloc must be set to 512 to be able to play all the 128 step. If i set it to only 264 only the first 64 waves will be inside the reach of the table alloc? Or is this wrong?</p>

<p>WOuld be nice if we could find a standard format that just fits perfectly and dont need any post Serum stretching. Like the 128 example I have made....</p>

<p>All the classics are already made for Serum. Again it would be much better to put a little effort into solving this issue that having to repitch all of them... I dont trust the repitch idea.... </p>

<p>Since the sizes of Serum wavetable and Axoloti table alloc are compatible it is much better to find out how to make this work perfectly. Then you just download whatever wavetable you need and use it... Much better in my opinion.</p>

<blockquote><p>the EASIEST thing to do would be making your own tables at the correct lengths.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>Yes exactly what I am trying to do. And if we can make Serum wavetables fit in Axoloti we dont even have to make them ourselves, because there are thousands already now. I think it is too much of a hassle having to repitch every single wavetable file you want to load in axoloti. WOuld be must simpler if we can just drag them in and set buffer size.</p>

<p>The wavetables from Serum is 31 bit float 44.1khz. I thought that Axoloti only used 16/32 bit depending on what you choose and 48khz sample rate?<br>. <br> Therefor I thought it was necessary to sample rate convert. If you say there is no need for it, Ill take your word and test it out. Then in theory it is pretty easy to use since a 128 wavetable from serum fits perfectly in a table/alloc 16b with 512 buffer size.</p>
