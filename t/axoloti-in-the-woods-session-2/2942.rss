    <title>Axoloti in the woods (session 2)</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/axoloti-in-the-woods-session-2/2942</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;ve just recorded a new walk in the woods, playing my last axoloti creation, the ribbon synth. 
I use a single patch that includes a panel of different oscillators, feeding into 4 delay lines. It also includes the element reverb.

I&#39;ve also managed to control solenoids using the axoloti, but still need to work on the mechanical side of things. Here is a video with me using it, synchronized to the same ribbon synth patch. You can&#39;t see it much, and I&#39;ve put it quite behind in the mix, as it mainly hits a tambourine, and I&#39;m not a big fan of the sound

              <p>The solenoids I use are 12v, and I don't use relay, but a home made simple circuit made with a transistor, a diode and a resistor. <br>You need to test your power supply by wiring up it up directly to a solenoid. If it moves, then the power supply and the solenoid isn't at fault. <br>I don't know what your relay module board is, and if it what kind of control voltage it requires, but if (as I read on the other thread) the leds light up, then I suppose it is working. Make sure all polarities are right, and that they work without using the relay (and that the power supply produces enough current).</p>

              <p>how did it work out wih the solenoids? im trying to get some going here, but have no luck (not sure if its my 24v power supply or the 8 relay module board im using etc.. ). anything youve learned would be helpful <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/+1.png?v=3" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
