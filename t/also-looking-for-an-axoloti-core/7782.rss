    <title>Also looking for an Axoloti Core</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/also-looking-for-an-axoloti-core/7782</link>
    <description>Hello all,

I am also on the hunt for an elusive Axoloti. I have one already with an axo-control board on top, but I&#39;m working on a new project that requires me to remove that board and I would much prefer to leave it on there and get a second Axoloti instead. 

I&#39;m UK based so let me know if any of you have one you&#39;d be happy to ship to me and how much you&#39;d want for it.

Thanks

P.S. still have my fingers crossed that Axoloti will come out of hibernation at some point. I love this platform.</description>
