    <title>Onboard connectors</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/onboard-connectors/6380</link>
    <description>Hi, I‘m building a drum sampler from one of my axoloti boards. Patch works as desired, so next is an aluminium enclosure. 

I‘m not good in precise drilling and I didn‘t manage so far to find a lasercutting service that does metal in small quantities here in Kuala Lumpur. Anyway I only need Audio In and Out  and Din Midi In. So my idea was to use panel mount sockets with short cables like in so many DIY projects.

Are there connectors (headers and/or solderpoints) on board I could use to attach Midi and Audio sockets via cables? Power socket is easy to replace and Micro USB I will connect via one of those chinese panel sockets. But the idea of desoldering the onboard Audio and Midi connectors to attach cables is a bit horror to me. Any help would be highly appreciated.</description>

              <p>Thanks guys,<br>I managed to remove a mental block and used my ohm-meter to find out which solderpoint corresponds to which connector. Even my favourite headers fit well into them. Project almost finished. I love this Takachi YM-180 case for the Axoloti. Will put my other two boards into them soon aswell.</p>

<p>Thanks again,<br>Wolfgang</p>

              <p>As for precise drilling, you can print a paper sheet with the centre of the holes, and use paper tape to glue it to the box. Then use a nail to puncture the centre of the holes, and after the centre is well marked you can start with drill. <br>If you want to have extra precision, first use a thin drill, let's say 3mm diameter, and then use the drill with the diameter of the component.<br>Hope this helps.</p>

              <p>You can probably solder your extra wires to the current solder points of the MIDI / Audio connectors as these are fairly large. No need to desolder these components.</p>
