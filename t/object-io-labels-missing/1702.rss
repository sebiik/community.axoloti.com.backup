    <title>Object IO labels missing</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/object-io-labels-missing/1702</link>
    <description>Although I report this for 1.0.10, it&#39;s not a 1.0.10 specific issue as I&#39;ve seen in in previous versions:

For some objects the input and/or output labels are missing. I&#39;ve seen this in factory objects and my own objects. Trying to change the names doesn&#39;t help. At one point when using 1.0.9, I discussed this with a mate, and did some refreshing, and suddenly the label appeared - I can&#39;t remember exactly what I did or which object it was, but it wasn&#39;t a real change to anything structural or syntactical IIRC. There may be some intentional mechanism at play that I&#39;m not aware of, but I&#39;d like those labels to show. 

Examples: 
axoloti-factory/objects/lfo/square =&gt; &quot;out&quot; label missing 
axoloti-contrib/objects/drj/osc/phasor_pm_pr_b  =&gt; &quot;out&quot; label missing

<p>In terms of screen-space, the worst offender is that objects stretch horizontally to accommodate the full name and path from their library. I think this really should be fixed. There's no good reason for an object to take up several times as much space, just because it has a long name, or is inside a couple of sub-directories. Just the name, and a rollover tooltip to display the full path is all that's needed, I think.</p>

<p>My personal preference is as stated that labels are always shown, I don't think it's obvious in all cases and for me it aids the readability of a patch - the module title is a bit "cramped" and low contrast, and with the small text size and not optimal  eyesight, the labels would make it more clear what's going on. Perhaps it's worth considering adding a noLabel attribute to inlets and outlets, which would be true by default?</p>

<p>I guess the reasoning is usually if there is only one, its often 'obvious' what the inlet/outlet does, so less screen clutter? I personally think this is true for many objects (e.g. +1) but perhaps not necessary clear with others?</p>

<p>personal preference though, I guess some will prefer this way, and others will prefer to see labels.</p>
