    <title>USB mass storage driver on host port</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/usb-mass-storage-driver-on-host-port/1829</link>
    <description>Is there any provision for this? Looking around the firmware I see it for an SDC or over SPI only, is this correct?

Specifically I&#39;m looking to hookup an old TFT companion display that is driven via the MSD command block wrapper, I&#39;ve already knocked together a working prototype on Linux so was wondering if it would be possible to port over.</description>

              <p>Not sure there is any advantage of the MSD approach. More that I have several of the devices and would like to recycle them as they have a lot of use potential. They were bundled with a lot of motherboards as a display for various Windows Sideshow widgets and system monitoring.</p>

<p>I'll have a look at the STMicro package, thanks for the pointer. Though I'm seeing what seem to be uart headers on some of them, I'll prod them and see if this is more fruitful. As you say, keeping the host port free would be nice.</p>

              <p>There is MSD class usb host driver code from STMicro in the STM32CubeF4 package, currently not integrated into the Axoloti firmware. My motivation for not integrating usb storage support is that I expect better performance from sdcard (4 bit parallel at 48MHz versus 12Mhz serial), and the most significant application for the usb host port is usb-midi controllers, while there is only one host port. Display-over-MSD: I haven't hear of this approach, what 'd be the advantage over vendor specific bulk? I can't offer much more help than pointing to the STMicro MSD host code.</p>
