    <title>Trill sensors - New I2C object</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/trill-sensors-new-i2c-object/7211</link>
    <description>Any plan of making an object to read from these [awesome touch sensors](https://bela.io/products/trill/)? It&#39;s speaking I2C, and the Arduino library is [here](https://github.com/BelaPlatform/Trill-Arduino).

I have some C/C++ experience, but not sure I&#39;ll be able to do it myself... How difficult would you say it is to make it work? Is it worth using parts of the Trill-Arduino code, or better start from scratch? I&#39;ve seen some posts about good practices for writing a new I2C object, but any advice/link welcome!

Thanks for your time and dedication.</description>
