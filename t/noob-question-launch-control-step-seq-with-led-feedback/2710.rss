    <title>Noob question, Launch control step seq with LED feedback</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/noob-question-launch-control-step-seq-with-led-feedback/2710</link>
    <description>Hello there, 
I&#39;m relative new in this axoloti patch making world.
I have a novation launch control (The small one with 8 buttons and 16 knobs). I&#39;d like to make a step sequencer with LED feedback, but i have a difficult time wrapping my head around how to make it.
the buttons LED can respond to midi note or cc, and different velocity levels make them change colour.
i like to have a cursor in one colour, showing me where I&#39;m at in the bar, and another colour for steps im plotting in. plus the ability to change the step&#39;s value with the knobs.

Can someone help me in the right direction here, and tell me what and how I need to do?

<blockquote><p>step seq BLOCKS  here are some modules for building step-seq's. my main focus was to simplify visual feedback for controllers that feature bi-directional MIDI, like the LIVID BASE or the NOVATION LAUNCHPAD.the help-patch should work with the  factory-mapping of the BASE. I had a hard time recently to acieve this with 'regular patching',so I did an object for this,'seq midi feedback' would be good to know if it works with the launchpad...   <a href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/5/53487afcc22263548901d9c7549d47896e717fcd.PNG" title="seq.PNG">[image]</a> besides,there are some other custom objects tâ€¦</p></blockquote></aside>
