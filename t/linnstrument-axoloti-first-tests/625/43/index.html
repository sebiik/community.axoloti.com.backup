        <p>ok, so I tested with my Eigenharp... and no issues, even when I started sending all data as 14 bit , no decimation.<br>(thats a lot of data, in fact, I had to send 6 parameters per note, without decimation, to start seeing ring buffer overflows ) </p>

<p>BUT.... I realised my test was flawed  ... </p>

<p>the issue, in the above test, is Im not receiving data on the usb host port <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/frowning.png?v=0" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>on both axoloti 1 &amp; 2, I was receiving the data on the device port, and only <strong>writing</strong> to the host port.  (ok, it succeeded well at that)</p>

<p>i.e.<br> Soundplane/Eigenharp -&gt; Mac -&gt; A1 (midithru dev to host) -&gt; A2 (synth (<strong>dev!</strong>) ,midiled (<strong>dev</strong>))</p>

<p>but with the linnstrument, you are receiving data from the linnstrument on the host port, and thats where we believe the problem lies.  (ok the code is kind of related, but still, not a good enough test!) </p>

<p>so here was my new test.. <br>(and here, you have to congratulate <a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> at how good this board is, I have to say I'm amazed this worked!)</p>

<ul>
<li>Mac connected to Axoloti 1 (device port) </li>
<li>Axoloti 1 has a midithru, from device port to host port 1</li>
<li>Axoloti 2 (device port)  connected to Axoloti 1 (host port) , runs a midithru, from device to host port</li>
<li>Axoloti 1, has the mpe synth patch running (as well!) which is only responding on the HOST PORT, and a midiled on host port (i.e. showing received data from Axoloti 2) </li>
</ul>

<p>i.e.<br>Soundplane/Eigenharp -&gt; Mac -&gt; A1 (midithru dev to host) -&gt; A2 (midithru with led (dev to host) ) -&gt; A1 (synth (host) ,midiled (host)) </p>

<p>and... <strong>it works</strong> <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/zap.png?v=0" title=":zap:" class="emoji" alt=":zap:"> <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/boom.png?v=0" title=":boom:" class="emoji" alt=":boom:"> <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/tada.png?v=0" title=":tada:" class="emoji" alt=":tada:"> <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/beers.png?v=0" title=":beers:" class="emoji" alt=":beers:"> </p>

<p>again, works with both eigenharp and soundplane, at no decimation levels, no perceivable latency.</p>

<p>Im impressed... axoloti 1 is having to receive all that midi data <strong>twice</strong>, send it once, and also run the mpe synth, with 8 voices, and its still only registering 51% CPU</p>

<p>(btw, yes, I changed settings (e.g. removing routings...)  to ensure the axoloti 1 patch  wasn't cheating me by taking the data directly <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">)   </p>

<p>what does this prove?</p>

<p>Axoloti is awesome, and 2 Axolotis are better still... truely the swiss army knife of midi <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/cow2.png?v=0" title=":cow2:" class="emoji" alt=":cow2:"></p>

        <p>I hadn't had the chance to test my Linnstrument yet.<br>That's worrying though because It seems like the issue could come from the Linnstrument.  If so I'll have to try to poke Geert about it but he's a pretty busy man...  From what I understand also the specific USB MIDI part of the firmware is not Open and is controlled by someone else which might complicate things...</p>

        <p>no issue, test when you get an opportunity.</p>

<p>btw: can you confirm you are not bus powering the Linnstrument. <br>(its important, at this stage we eliminate power as an issue)</p>

<blockquote><p>That's worrying though because It seems like the issue could come from the Linnstrument.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>oh, I think its too early days to say that, something like 600+ Linnstruments are out there, talking to PC/Mac and other devices, so thats a good indications it acting 'as expected'. Frankly, we don't really anything to give Geert for him to look into.</p>

<p>Im sure its probably is load related, as I don't know of any other midi controller with issues with Axoloti, thats why Id hope this would have exposed it, but perhaps theres some other timing thing going on.</p>

<p>another interesting to test might be to try to do a test with something like iConnectMidi?<br>( I think iConnectMIDI can be both a device and host , no?) </p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/keyman">@keyman</a> have you tried your continuum with MPE with axoloti yet? (assuming the firmware was released) <br>perhaps trying it continuum din -&gt; iconnnectmidi -&gt; usb -&gt; axoloti , might yield something interesting.</p>

<p>I'll ping Geert, see what he thinks, but I suspect the only way we will get more info beyond the above, is by debugging Axoloti with a Linnstrument attached.</p>

        <p>Yes Continuum mpe firmware is out since after NAMM. Can't recall anything having issues Continuum&gt;Axo.<br>I do recall issues with IConnectmidi being a device..I think...<br>There is also a new  firmware out as of yesterday,</p>

<p>As always i'm following close by; havent use 1.0.9 that much yet <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

        <p>Ive had a quick email exchange with Geert, he said he saw something similar with iOS, and hence the low power mode.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/natcl">@natcl</a> and <a class="mention" href="/users/alexk">@alexk</a>  did you try low power mode, or could you please try this and see if it helps.<br>preferably with it connected to a power supply, though I don't know if this is possible.<br>(apologies if you have already tried this, its hard to keep up sometimes :)) </p>

<p>fyi: the low power mode spaces the individual bytes of the midi messages that are sent to the serial to USB MIDI  chip within the Linnstrument.</p>

        <p>So I've made some tests this evening.</p>

<p>I can confirm that with firmware 1.2.4 on linnstrument and 1.0.9 on Axoloti, it works fine in Low power mode.  If I attempt to use it in normal power mode I get the glitches.  I tried the tests with the Linnstrument powered externally.  In low power mode the Axoloti seems able to power the linnstrument just fine.<br>So for now this is totally acceptable for me, easier to go in low power mode than play with the USB micro delay manually...</p>

        <p>Geert pushed some fixes to the repo yesterday and was kind enough to send me a test build, good news, it fixed all the issues with Axoloti (and most probably other synths too).<br>From what I understand in some cases the Linnstrument would send incomplete midi messages.</p>

<p>Thanks Geert ! And thanks <a class="mention" href="/users/thetechnobear">@thetechnobear</a> for testing !</p>

        <p>oh thats excellent news... Geert is very responsive to these things, I wonder if it will also help the iOS platform too... he is a huge asset for the Linnstrument!</p>

<p>btw: you should try axoloti 1.0.10 too, <a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> has switch the axoloti over to using dma for the usb host, which could also improve performance.</p>

<p> anyway, sounds like you can start to have some real fun with axoloti now <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=2" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<blockquote><ol><li>linnstrument plays nice with axoloti.  i needed my linnstrument to run in low power mode using axoloti as a host and thin out the USB data on linnstrument to about 300.  not sure if running the axoloti off an adapter would make a difference but just in case anyone else has this problem.  it seems to work well as an expressive controller;  i only started to have problems when i started to play around with the arpeggiator. Notes being dropped mostly.</li></ol></blockquote></aside><p>Had some more time to spend with new linnstrument os. There is a new beta for axoloti that i tried out as well.</p>
<p>some differences since i updated axolti as well-  it will now run on full power, it's every so slightly jittery but it gets smooth if you thin out usb data to about 300.  if you run linnstrument in low power mode, its smooth at full speed (usb data at 0 delay)  still can't arpegiate without lost notes, but i'm just glad i can use the axoloti with linnstrument now.   </p>
</blockquote></aside>

<p>for setting up the linnstrument use latest os for both axoloti and linnstrument.</p>

<p>use a the normal mpe mode: <br>1. channel per note <br>2. <span class="hashtag">#74</span> cc y axis<br>3. channel pressure z axis</p>

<p>and:<br>1. x axis at linnstrument setting of 48.<br>2. at this moment run linnstrument in low power mode with usb delay setting of 0 or high power mode with usb delay setting of 300 on linnstrument (results may vary)<br>3. arpeggiator is unstable for use with axoloti at time of this posting. it works but notes are dropped.  </p>

<p>the included library has an object from mark harris (technobear) that makes it easy to setup patches for linnstrument in the above mentioned way.  there is an option on the object that allows you to select number of voices and this will maximize cpu overhead on the axoloti.</p>

<p>i have a few instances where some objects glitch some of the settings; the pitch bend range will get knocked into different ranges. if this happens, save your work often while patching and revert to a state where the pitch bend range is at the normal setting with the technobear mpe object.</p>

<p>is this regardless of delay setting?<br>does the arp mode work in mpe mode? and does it send all note of the arp on the same channel, or does it distribute them across channels?  (sorry I don't know what how mode is implemented on the linnstrument)<br>the current axoloti mpe implementation assumes one note at a time on a channel, since it directly connects to a voice, putting multiple notes on one channel, would mean you'd (potentially) need multiple voices per channel.<br>it could be done, but not something ive needed so far.... I guess because i dont have a linnstrument, and dont tend to use arps much <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=2" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>hi natcl,  have you had time to play with new axoloti and linnstrument OS?</p>

<p>i wasn't aware of that feature of holding down the channel per note button on linnstrument.  i think i have it setup per the standard though.</p>

<p>the results seem to be the same for the arp however when trying both ways for mpe mode.  it sends a note at a time per channel on the linnstrument.   it sounds like axoloti drops a note here and there  as soon as arp is turned on.</p>

<p>it's not a big deal.  arps can be setup elsewhere or i can run through midi jacks.  it's the only thing i can think of so far that doesn't seem to work.  the axoloti is responding very well otherwise.</p>

        <p>Hi. Is my first time posting. I just got an Axoloti Core  and also a used Linnstrument.  I was attracted to the Axoloti due to the flexibility and also it being open source.I am excited to learn both and understand that there will be a learning curve.  Of course I found and read this tread with interest. I am somewhat technical so I can handle that complexity. But I'd rather build on the knowledge of others rather than reinvent the wheel, so to speak. This thread leads me to believe that it's probably not "plug and play". I was hoping that someone who has succeeded in getting the two working together could post here a bullet-point version of the steps, both hardware and software, required. Thanks ahead!</p>

<p>They work nicely together; Axoloti powers LinnStrument and the later plays and controls Axoloti; sometimes  things need a little tweaking “under the hood” in the beginnings;-)</p>

<p>I have done complete shows just with Axoloti + LinnStrument.</p>
