    <title>Could Axoloti fry my mixer channels</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/could-axoloti-fry-my-mixer-channels/4885</link>
    <description>Yesterday I was connecting my axoloti to my home studio for the first time. After fiddling arround a bit to get it working I noticed that I lost one of my mixer channels. Could this be caused by the axoloti? The axoloti seem to work fine although I had a screaming sound at one time in the process. I did disconnect the audio out once or twice while the axoloti was powered. Any thoughts.</description>

              <p>Peak to peak voltage is low on Axoloti compared to many other instruments.  (Particularly modular!)</p>

<p>Ive always had my Axolotis connected to my mixer, no troubles<br>( if anything Iâ€™ve had to raise the gain on the mixer. )</p>
