        <p>Hello everybody,</p>

<p>first post here in the forum after looking around for some weeks and reading lots of articles. <br>Loving the Forum, loving Axoloti!! Great job Johannes!</p>

<p>Anyways, I was wondering what the best way would be to protect the analogue ins from high currents.<br>I am currently in the process of building an enclosure with pots and some IO jacks. The plan is to use Axoloti as a standalone instrument as well as with my Eurorack system. I want to send CV back an forth between the modular and Axoloti. <br>I found lots of schematics for op amp circuits to convert the voltages. However I have quite a few Eurorack utility modules already where I can amplify, scale, offset and invert CV signals in every possible way in order to get something useful.  So I don't feel the need to build another op amp circuit.<br>However I'd like to protect my GPIOs and Axoloti from accidentally sending in an unscaled signal like +10V or +/-5V. From my understanding that could really damage the Axoloti Core board, right?<br>Would a simple circuit with an input resistor and a couple of shottky diodes (bat 48 for example?) be able to protect the board? Like this one:<img src="http://community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/e/edffaaf55603a9f5123e9f0743a2d3ca36696de1.jpg" width="570" height="256"></p>

<p>If yes: Do I need to connect the +3V3 to the VDDA, VDDC or VDD?</p>

<p>Last question: Is it possible/ necessary to protect an analogue GPIO output as well?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any help and comments.<br>Happy Monday to you all!!</p>

        <p>What value do you have in mind for R3?</p>

<p>If R3 would be 1kOhm, and you feed +10V into CVin, it injects 6.5mA into the +3.3V supply. If you 'd do this on 15 analog gpio inputs, this adds up to almost 100mA in the worst case of feeding them all with +10V. If there is no consumption of 100mA on the 3.3V supply, the linear regulator will not be effective anymore, but the +3.3V supply will lift up, and this can certainly cause damage...<br>So I suggest to use VDD (not VDDC) as the 3.3V net, VDDC has much less consumption.<br>And use more than 1kOhm for R3, say, 4.7kOhm.</p>

<p>You can use exactly the same circuit to protect the analogue GPIO outputs.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the detailed reply. Really useful infos for an electronic-noob like me.</p>

<p>For the moment I use a 10KOhm resistor and bat48 shottky diodes. VDD as 3.3V net.</p>

<p> I tested the circuit on breadboard without having any GPIO connected. When I feed it +10V I get about 3.6V coming out on the other end and around -0.4V when I send in -5V. <br>However, I don't intend to send 10V CV to the Axoloti anyway. The idea is to attenuate any CV signals with a passive attenuator (10KOhm Pot) coming from the modular prior to sending it through the protection circuit into the GPIOs. The resistor and diode clamp is just a safety precaution in case I make a mistake. The maximum CV inputs will be 4.</p>

<p>If I use the same circuit for the analogue outs, do I need the resistor as well as the diodes? If yes, in which order?</p>
