    <title>Having hard time with execution order... sometime</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/having-hard-time-with-execution-order-sometime/1561</link>
    <description>Every time i make something complex (for exemple a sequencer with lots of logic modules), im always having trouble with debuging problems caused by execution order, something i dont really experience with my Nord G2. You really have to be careful when you move your stuff around. :smile:</description>

              <p>yeah, I had the same, when I first stated playing with axoloti.</p>

<p>its natural , I think, to follow the wires... and think this is going to be how it works, so i think most of us have been caught out at some time or another. (even if you know!)</p>

<p>i think the axoloti approach is actually simpler than some other graphic languages, but its main disadvantage is (as you pointed out) if your not careful, its easy to break patches by tidying them up.</p>

<p>i think the other reasons it causes problems is <strong>many</strong> patches will work, even though the execution order is not quite right, because it often doesn't matter if the object is executed on the next cycle. so like anything, if you 'get away with it' most of the time, its easy to get in to bad habits.... </p>

<p>i do find though, if you think about execution order when your making the patch its not too bad (easier than fixing large patches later), and it tends to make you do it for every patch...</p>

<p>well, thats in theory what I attempt to do, though I often dont... I guess due to laziness <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>we do want at some point to give more visual feedback in the patcher, so its clearer to the user what order things are being done... but so many things to do at the moment.</p>

<p>Edit : I never used the send receive object, i will take a look today.</p>

              <p>bare in mind object are always executed</p>

<p>left to right <br>top to bottom</p>

<p>the key is to remember the 'wires' have absolutely no influence on this ordering.</p>

<p>no data is flowing down the wires... causing changes.<br>the wire, simply 'presents data' to the connect objects inlet, to be evaluated then next time it is executed.</p>

<p>its pretty simple when you get used to it, but yes, placement will change behaviour.<br>(like it does with max, except with Max, you have the trigger object to tame it) </p>

<p>have you looked at the send/recieve object?  I find these can help you keep a patch a bit tidier.<br>also using subpatches can help (patch/patcher) as they group things together.</p>

<p>but yeah, these things are 'different' so take a bit of getting used, getting into the 'mindset'</p>
