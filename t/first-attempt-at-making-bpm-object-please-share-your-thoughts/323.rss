    <description>Hey  

This is first naive attempt at making a frequency to BPM converter. I
 took a look at some Reaktor patches for BPM calculating. I tested it at
 120 BPM since it can be calculated into a clean frequency. 120/60 = 
2hz. But it starts drifting noticeable after 4 bars.

Would be great if anyone wants to chip in. To have a BPM object would
 really benefit everyone that works with computer music in BPM.

<p>C++ books will teach you a lot of things that are hardly relevant for Axoloti. The programming constructs used in the objects are most elementary. The harder part is expressing what you want to do, where the difficulty is not so much in programming but in the math and DSP.</p>

<p>If you want to learn about music-dsp, not sure what to recommend. I learned from many different resources over a long time, I don't know where to start.</p>

<p>I thought I multiplied the frequency of the LFO with 60, since I used a multiply object for the calculations. Since you say it doesnt really matter or do any difference I will leave it there and dive into other ideas. Still learning the math side of it. Never had to worry about these things on G2.</p>

<p>anyway, as i said, have you tried a frequency based LFO, like lfo/sine lin which should, I think, not  have this issue. (basically an unsynced clock would be pretty similar, just using a pulse rather than a sine, but both are useable given triggers are based on rising transitions)</p>

<p>You multiplied the gate output of lfo/square by 60. While that does not make sense, it also makes no difference in your findings.</p>

<p>The drift may be there, I need to setup measurements. I can see the relevance of a clock master object. I can see the need for a midi clock sync slave LFO's. Give it some time, things will develop further.</p>

<p>I compared it to the click of Logic DAW.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/thetechnobear">@thetechnobear</a><br>But in this case, when you need something to the beat, you cannot have roundings like you say about the LFO. Still the LFO rounding concerns me also for other purposes, but again I have no idea on how other synth are really build and if they have rounding on their LFOs. Adding a sync function to the LFO would also be great, but for now, lets just figure out the BPM object. I think that will open of for making the synced LFOs too...... Cause sync is important in modern world music. Also if you want to sync the lfos to Midi clock, it is a problem. this is not possible at the moment, right?</p>

<p>I know 0.06 is not much, but 0.01 is also not much, but not good enough when you want to sync it to BPM, that is the whole point, right? It has to sync and be precise.</p>

<p>About the 120 BPM being 120.04: I understand your thought path, but no one I know thinks 120 BPM is 120.04 BPM. As far as I know all DAWs and the rest of the world agrees that 120 BPM is 120 BPM and not 120.04 BPM.</p>

<p> And this is even one of the even frequency numbers. How will it look if you for example take 137 BPM and look at the LFO freq?(sorry cant check right now, will check later). I think it will be alot worse than the even BPMs. </p>

<p>I think BPM object is very essential to modern music in many ways. Maybe YOU don't want to use it, but it should at least be an option, right?</p>

<p>it uses this  fast hacked object<br><a class="attachment" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/1X/cf2f2a18e1b7f9dec228770f2b88ee70a7517081.axo">countdown_square.axo</a> (1.0 KB) </p>

<p>Basically I'm overflowing a integer - and I calculated the magic number (subtraction - going through all the values a 32bit integer can have in 1 BPM) the following way:</p>

<p>Countdown number for 1 BPM=(MAX_INT*(1 BPM/60))/(CALL Rate) = ((2^32-1)*(1/60))/3000 = 23860.929416666666</p>

<p>You see it's a fraction - so I approximated to 23861 <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt="wink"></p>

<p>EDIT: and from there you can go to any BPM by multiplying <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley.png?v=0" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt="smiley"> (23861*2 means two times as fast - which means 2 BPM and so on and so forth)</p>

<p>not really wrong, it just normal issues you get when you have display rounding... </p>

<p>theres a few things going on in this 'area' which confuse things:<br>- floating point numbers represented as 32bits are never entirely accurate<br>- there is a conversion from 'midi note' to frequency (see the pitch+/- that tells you its using pitch not frequency natively)<br>- display accuracy/rounding<br>- a dials 'micro' increments, e.g. whats the smallest amount we can shift it by?</p>

<p>anyway... so yes these could be avoided (or alleviated) using a custom clock object with integer times.</p>

<p>as for how you can fix...<br>so to change the cycle of a clock, gets into the territory of clock multipliers/combining multiple signals.<br>but thats not easy to get accurate.</p>

<p>what might work is to try an LFO that has a frequency input, say use a lfo/sine lin, this may not have the same inaccuracies, as it avoid the last 3 of the problems above.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to see if its helps</p>

<p>of course its worth noting 0.6ms is not very long.... the sample rate is 48000 with 16 samples , so that about which is about 0.3ms ! so the drift is not very big... about 1 second in 30 minutes.</p>

<p>this only becomes a problem if you are trying to sync to something external but if thats the case you always send sync signal, as no clock is entirely accurate. this sync then resets the clocks, to avoid the natural drift between different clocks.</p>

<p>(times relatives, so doesnt really matter if 120bpm is really 120.04 as long as all devices agree it :))</p>

<p>I can see the need for a tempo lfo, with outputs for bar, quarter, and 24ppq. Oh I see midi/out/clock, but it lacks a scale indication on the tempo parameter, and maybe other aspects of this object are unfinished.</p>

<p>But that just tells me that the LFO amounts are off then. and the calculations are right...</p>

<p>IF 2hz becomes 120.04 BPM after changing the display, then there is something wrong with how it is displayed or the calculations inside the LFO. 2hz IS 120 BPM and not 120.04 BPM. Agree or not?</p>

<p>I think a new object programmed from bottom up would be a great solution. Only very few BPMs have even numbers when converted to frequencies, for example 90, 120, 180, and so on..... But the LFO speed thingy is a bit worrying. Especially if you want to make things precise and sync it with loops in BPM and alot of other scenarios....</p>

<p>We should make a "wishlist" with objects, etc that could use an update or a "would be nice to have list" <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile"></p>

<p>Still pretty happy with it. Almost reach my goal on building my sample manipulator and it is better than I had planned <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt="wink"></p>

<p>I wonder if the pitch input could be used to help 'fine' tune it.... as the accuracy of input here, is being controlled by the UI, not the implementation.</p>

<p>probably easier to implement though as a new object, where we can use an integer bpm input, and then create a pulse as a trigger output.</p>

<p>I am trying to do the exactly same thing you are trying to do; to make a BPM based object. If you want to approach it in your way, you have to go all the way down to programming level, I think. Sure if you know how to do that, please do so <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile"> I would love to get that object.

<p><strong>You're multiplying the output of the LFO with 60 - why?</strong> </p>

<p>Cause that is how you calculate frequencies into BPM, search google if you don't believe.</p>

<p>This is how it is done in most cases, BUT it is really hard to do with all frequencies, cause a lot of the calculations from BPM to frequencies ends up in uneven frequency numbers that is not possible to set as a value in any lfo in Axoloti. </p>

<p>Frequency to bpm calculations:<br>Frequency multiplied by 60 = BPM</p>

<p>BPM to frequency calculations:<br>BPM divided by 60 = frequency.</p>

              <p>Hey  </p>

<p>This is first naive attempt at making a frequency to BPM converter. I<br> took a look at some Reaktor patches for BPM calculating. I tested it at<br> 120 BPM since it can be calculated into a clean frequency. 120/60 = <br>2hz. But it starts drifting noticeable after 4 bars.</p>

<p>Would be great if anyone wants to chip in. To have a BPM object would<br> really benefit everyone that works with computer music in BPM.</p>

<p>Patch: <a class="attachment" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/1X/593f963db623634d3c8782fc1804aa4ee8b1a80a.axp">BPM Object I.axp</a> (4.0 KB) </p>
