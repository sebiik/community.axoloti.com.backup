    <title>Which euclidian sequencer do you use?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/which-euclidian-sequencer-do-you-use/4312</link>
    <description>Hi,
I’m kind of new and got a bit lost with all the euclidean sequencer/generators available in the patcher.
i don’t get to make some of them work, and other are doing some really weird stuff that I didn&#39;t really expected.
I would be interested to know which one you like the most.
All best,
Olivier</description>
