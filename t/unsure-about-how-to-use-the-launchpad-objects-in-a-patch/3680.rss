    <title>Unsure about how to use the launchpad objects in a patch</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/unsure-about-how-to-use-the-launchpad-objects-in-a-patch/3680</link>
    <description>Hi,

I got my axoloti today - Really impressed by what it can do so far, and I&#39;ve found a set of objects (`rbrt/launchpad/`) that look powerful, and good to use to add launchpad support to my patches, however I can&#39;t figure out how they work/ how to use them. Can someone explain?</description>

<p>my patch for Launchpad Pro is <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/patch-custom-note-layout-handler-for-launchpad-pro/4893">here</a>, (and can be easily adapted to any class-compatible Launchpad by editing one embedded object).</p>

<p>but my patch highlights only C notes of every octave, because doing more highlighting involves too much patching in my version.</p>

              <p>Thanks so much that just helped me get light feedback depending on which notes I'm pressing using the midi/out/note object. I figured out how to tune the rows using a conveniently layed out jaffa/sel/sel i 64. Now I'm on to figuring out how the default led layout on power up can light up the notes of the C scale with the Cs being a different color and all the black notes not lit.</p>

              <p>Hi, I've only been using axoloti for around a month, but I've been using the launchpad objects a fair bit for making step sequencers. I don't think they'll work for what your doing, unless I'm missing something. There's probably a good chance I'm missing something!</p>

<p>The matrix display object will display lights on the buttons. Where the lights appear depend on the start/length attributes. But the on/off side of things reacts to information stored on a table, not the real time input. This is useful for step sequencers designed around storing the sequence in a table. The step toggle object (can't remember exact names as I'm not at my computer) stores the on/off status in a table.</p>

<p>The step display object displays the current step position, think of a light that moves across the buttons to show the current play position of the step sequencer.</p>

<p>The fader object allows you to use a row of pads as a fader.</p>

<p>The button display objects are useful to display lights on the top and side buttons, not the main 64 pad grid.</p>

<p>The launchpad in (maybe called matrix in) object is good for real time input - it translates the grid so that instead of sending the weird layout of notes the launchpad normally uses, it sends notes in a logical semitone arrangement (send the pitch and gate outputs to a synth and have a play to see what I mean). This is closest to the kind of thing you want, I think. But to display lights you'll probably have to patch something together to send the correct note signals back to the launchpad. The launchpad reacts to the same notes it sends out, so to light a pad you need to send back the same note the pad uses, the velocity of the note determines what colour is displayed. The factory midi note out object can be used to send the notes to the launchpad.</p>

<p>Hope that helps clear things up a little, I may have just made things more confusing!</p>

              <p>Yeah I'm also having a hard time figuring out how to use these objects. I wanted to put a chromatic note layout like a push along with corresponding lights to go with this layout. Do these objects make this possible? Really haven't been able to figure this out, I'm getting all kinds of crazy light outputs.</p>

              <p>Ok, I don't have a launchpad and I've not tried a launchpad type controller with Axoloti yet.</p>

<p>I've got a livid block and will get around to plugging it in to Axo in a bit.</p>

<p>Documentation seems to be pretty thin in most areas of this project.</p>

<p>I'm sorry but I don't have the time to take a deeper look at the objects right now but have a few suggestions as to how to progess.</p>

<p>Try and contact the developer but while you are waiting for him to reply have a look at the object definition in the editor and see if you can understand how it works from there.</p>

<p>Plug your launch pad in and see if you can develop your own subpatch that does something similar, this might help you to understand how the launchpad interacts with Axo and then you might be able to make more sense of someone else's objects that do the same thing.</p>

<p>Try and document what you do and what you learn so others can learn from it as well.</p>
