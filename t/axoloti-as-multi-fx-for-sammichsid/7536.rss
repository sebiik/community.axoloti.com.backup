    <title>Axoloti as multi FX for SammichSID</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/axoloti-as-multi-fx-for-sammichsid/7536</link>
    <description>Hi!
I&#39;ve been experimenting with pushing the limits of traditional multiFX, this patch uses the midi note of the kick drum on MIDI channel 10 as a trigger for Sidechain compression. It also creates a pure sine sub-oscillator for some deep bass goodness. :3
I think the wonky nice sound of the SammichSID works out really well with the clean sound of the Digitakt and I&#39;m really satisfied with how this track turned out. What do you think? =)
