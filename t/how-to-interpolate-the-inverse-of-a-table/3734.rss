    <title>How to interpolate the inverse of a table?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/how-to-interpolate-the-inverse-of-a-table/3734</link>
    <description>Is there an object that can be used as the functional inverse of &quot;table/read interp&quot;? 

I&#39;m creating a calibration program for a ribbon controller that has to sync my finger with a strip of one-cm spaced LED&#39;s, and I have a table that can take the number of centimeters your finger is on the ribbon and turn it into a voltage (I pressed my finger down every cm on the ribbon and recorded the voltages in a table). But I need to take the inverse of this function, to convert voltage to centimeters (on the ribbon), which is obviously more useful :stuck_out_tongue: 
 
Is there an object that I can use to do this? (The fact that my table is monotonically increasing ensures that an inverse exists for this table: so it might look like [1,2,3,6,8] but will never look like [1,1,2,2,3,3] or [5,3,2,6,8] etc.)</description>

              <p>Aww, thats dissapointing - I've got the theoretical relationship down, it's just not perfect: the ribbon isn't precisely linear as it should be. It's very close to linear but not quite there; even a third-order polynomial fit doesn't work very well <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> But thanks for the response!</p>

              <p>afaik, there is no object to do this (there isn't in the factory, you never know in the community library)</p>

<p>you could write one, basically you need to do a binary search on a table (as its sorted) for the value, this is ok, as long as the able is small... but you will hit performance issues if it becomes large.</p>

<p>however, id be tempted to try to do this by determining the mathematical relationship between position and voltage... this would take less resources (memory and cpu) <br>depending on your ribbon, its probably exponential, plus a bit of scaling/offset.<br>if you plotted the values on a spreadsheet, it would probably be easy enough to find a close approximation... without that it would be a bit of trial n error.</p>
