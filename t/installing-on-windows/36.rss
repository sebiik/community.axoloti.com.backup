    <description>#Normal Installation
To reduce size we split the application into two parts, the main axoloti application, and a runtime which contains other required files. You must download and install both initially. 
(Usually updates will only require the main application to be downloaded and installed.)

 1. **download** both **application bundle** and **axoloti_runtime**
  - go to http://github.com/axoloti/axoloti/releases, you will see the &#39;latest release&#39;
  - download axo_runtime_win.(version).msi
  - download axoloti_win_(version).zip
 -  **install runtime zip**:
  -  double click on zip file to unzip the file 
on a 32bit windows system, this needs to be copied to:
C:\Program Files
on a 64 bit windows system, this needs to be copied to:  
C:\Program Files (x86)
  - now check that you have  **C:\Program Files\axoloti_runtime\platform_win** or 
 **C:\Program Files (x86)\axoloti_runtime\platform_win** as appropriate.
  - *if* when unzipped you find a folder other than axoloti_runtime, then look into that folder for axoliti_runtime, it is axoloti_runtime that must be copied to Program Files. 
 -  **install axoloti application msi**:
  - double click on the MSI file
  - you may get a warning from windows about not trusting, this is due to it not being signed, you can safely ignore this, click on More Info, and then click on &quot;Run Anyway&quot;
 - **Connect axoloti core board**, this will start windows installing the necessary drivers (if they are not already installed), and create a device called &quot;Axoloti Core&quot;
 - **Run Axoloti** application, you will find it in C:\Program Files  or C:\Program Files(x86) 

Thats it, your done!!

Happy patching

##Recommended Platform
Axoloti runs on many platforms and variations, but we are only able to test on limited number of platforms, if you experience issues we recommend the following, as these are our test platforms.
- Windows 7, 8, 10
- Java 1.8  (can be downloaded from https://java.com/en/download/)

##Developer installation (from source)
If you are a developer and would like to follow the most up to date developments, and perhaps contribute to Axoloti development you can install from the Axoloti github repo

 - clone from github
 - run build.bat in platform_windows
 - run ./Axoloti.bat

Note: to create the bundles you will need to install the Oracle Java 8 JDK


##Advanced installation (Rescue mode)
Usually you can flash the firmware with Axoloti using the regular flashing method, which the above installation will handle.
However, there is a &#39;rescue mode&#39; (aka DFU mode)  which can be used if the board appears to not respond to normal firmware flashing. This is a &#39;rare&#39; situation, if you have an issue that requires it we will let you know.
(most users will not need this function!)

this &#39;rescue&#39; mode, also called DFU, requires a different driver from the normal Axoloti driver,  unfortunately for windows, the driver installed by default (STM32 Bootloader) is not compatible, and we need to replace it with the generic WinUSB driver.

To do this:

- Enter rescue mode, by powering down the board, press S1 and hold, and power up the board. The two LEDs stay off in this case.
- Windows will then install the incompatible driver, wait for this to complete.
- After, go to C:\Program Files (x86)\axoloti_runtime\platform_win and run Zadig (zadig_2.1.2.exe)
- Initially, the Zadig window is blank 
- select  &quot;Options &gt; List All Devices&quot;
- While the axoloti board is in DFU mode, it will be listed as STM32 BOOTLOADER in the dropdown menu -  select it.
- You will see Driver : Stu* -&gt; WinUSB (v6.1.7600.16385 etc) and underneath, Replace Driver, press &quot;Replace Driver&quot;, this will replace the STM driver with the WinUSB driver
- Now Axoloti flash rescue mode will work.
- You can check that this is mode is available by staying in DFU mode,  start the Axoloti UI, go to &quot;Board&gt;Select Device...&quot;, it will say &#39;STM DFU&#39; in the description, driver OK.  (also Flash (Rescue) will be enabled)</description>
