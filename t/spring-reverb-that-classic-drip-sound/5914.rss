    <title>Spring reverb (that classic drip sound)</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/spring-reverb-that-classic-drip-sound/5914</link>
    <description>Hi!
I recently had a lot of fun patching reverbs, specially using the dispersion matrices by @SmashedTransistors and @TheSlowGrowth allpasses. 
I was now trying to make a spring sounding reverb, with very little success indeed. I read (tried to...) this
https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=452562
And the only bit that made sense to me was in this one http://recherche.ircam.fr/pub/dafx11/Papers/39_e.pdf
and the general concept that a moving spring behaviour is a very difficult one to emulate.
Has anyone ever come close to patch a spring sounding reverb? Any general idea?</description>
