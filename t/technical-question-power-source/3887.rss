    <title>Technical question: power source</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/technical-question-power-source/3887</link>
    <description>In order to increase the number of pots on my controller I have added an mcp23s17 and two mcp3008 chips. I was wondering if they need dedicated power from the 5v source behind the midi connectors or if they are powered via the connector I have added to bridge my sawn in half axo. Or do I need to source power elsewhere? I don&#39;t get a response when I test their functionality at the moment and I want to make sure this is patch-related rather than a hardware issue &lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4449249d7958bacdc00bde79faefb9ea7f063d54.JPG&quot; width=&quot;375&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;</description>

              <p>Its OK to tap into both the 5V power on your bridge connection, but use the GND on it as well, just to keep all your connections in order. I powered a completely separate midi controller this way as a substitute for batteries. Worked fine, switched on every time the Axo was powered.<img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/grinning.png?v=5" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:"></p>
