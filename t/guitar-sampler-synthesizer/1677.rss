    <title>Guitar Sampler/Synthesizer</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/guitar-sampler-synthesizer/1677</link>
    <description>It&#39;s been three months of intense patching with Axoloti and finally I&#39;ve got my sequenced sampler patch ready to go on the road and hopefully on stage this summer! Thanks to all of you that helped me, the input of this community is really great! 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KlYsgzgnbk&amp;feature=youtu.be

It is kind of a sampler that records little samples of my playing, triggers them from a step sequencer that I patched, plays the samples back in different octaves and/or reverse and puts it through filter and amp envelopes. In the end everything goes through a delay.

I control it using a nanokontrol 2 and I added jacks for Guitar Footswitches and Expression Pedals. The sound you here is purely axoloti, no external fx added. (really shitty recording, I want to change that in the future!) For guitar I want to add a preamp to make it sound more like an electric guitar, but this is already quite expressive. 

Since it&#39;s nice weather here I want to play with it on the streets. I also plan to integrate this into a bigger more professional live setup, so If you&#39;re in Germany maybe you can catch me playing on a festival, the one that starts with and f and ends with usion for example :slight_smile:</description>

<p>No I didn't get the pitch detection to work. This patch totally works with sampling, I called it guitar Synthesizer because the samples run through a synth filtering and env engine wich makes it more synthesizeresque sounding.</p>

<p>This is the latest stable version of the patch:<br><a class="attachment" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3249c749573b2fa7047b8e8730a32b1b4d9d889d.axp">Le Grand Patch.axp</a> (132.7 KB)</p>

<p>It is quite messy and I am working a lot to change, improve and tidy up some things. If you want to try it the best thing is to extract the lpsmpl object I guess, since this is doing the sampling.</p>

<p>Yeah it's incredible what kind of interesting textures you can get by simply pitching audio material. I've been trying all of this out for years in the studio, now I finally have a device that does it in realtime in a performance <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=2" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>It get's even more interesting once you start feeding this with an Instrument that has more Harmonics, such as Acoustic Guitar or an electric with a proper preamp/amp sim.</p>
