    <title>Recording pulse to table question</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/recording-pulse-to-table-question/3223</link>
    <description>Hello :) 

I was just playing around with recording some sequences(pulse signals) to a table, to play them back later. For now I have been using a table/alloc 8b sdram. It works fine, but I was just wondering if there are other ways of recording pulses to table. Since it is basically only zero and one(on/off) being written, there is really no need for all 8 bits so I would like to save that for other purposes. 

Or another thought; maybe I could record more than one sequence at once in the 8 bits? Like maybe 4 sequences? 

Thanks in advance, Jaffa</description>

              <p>Here is a picture f the recording system and the playback system. Both works fine. You write the sequencer on the top one and play it back from the table below. I tried to make the disp/ibar blink when the table sends out a pulse. It works but doesnt really give a  good result, it is very hard to see what is going on. But that is not really an issue.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@SputnkiI</span> tried looking at the help patch for the shift register object.. I dunt really understand it much yet. Do you think it could be combined with recording system I made?</p>

              <p>Thank you for the technical details. I has a thought that shifting was one way to do it. BUt it is still not 100% clear to me how to do this. But I guess i need to look through those objects you mention. And I now know what to google <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>I think I need to be confirmed in a few things here. 32 bit means sequences of length of 2048? 16 bit can store 1024 in length, right? I would like to be able to record more "layers" of sequences, so I can basically record more than one sequence to a table at at time.</p>

<p>The approach I have used now Is basically just a pulse sequencer controlled by a counter and then fed into the table...., Create you pattern on the sequencer that you like, push record and it stores the sequence to a table. But this is a bit clumsy... For some reason if I want to have a 16 step sequence I would need to record a 32 samples long sequence... Just recording 16 doesnt work here... I guess if I just record 16 pulses to a 16 samples long table, Axoloti wil only understand the first note send:</p>

<p>1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1</p>

<p>Like the above, 16 notes but no pauses inbetween. THis means that Axoloti ONLY plays back the first on the 16 pulses and is thereafter silent.... BUT if I on the other hand record 32 steps (32 samples) i get both on and off, like this:</p>

<p>1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 </p>

<p>This works, BUT since it is twice the length I would also have to play it back at dobbelt speed... Small issue I guess.</p>

<p>This is my naive approach. In this set up, a counter and the table sets the length. You approach sounds more advanced and also more effective.. I guees I need to do some more reading. </p>

<p>I checked your siso object. Wil try it and see what I can come up with. Oh, btw, which other objects did you mean tht you and sss have made that can save sequences to table?</p>

<p>Thanks <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>You could hack the 32bit nature of variables. You can use shift registers for that, but you're limited to 32 bit long sequences. <br>I and sirsicksick have made a couple of objects, maybe you can try them</p>

<p>Imagine a long  box with a certain number of sections (in the case of axoloti it's 32, but for this example i'll do 8) and two open ends.</p>

<p>something like this: <br><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/f/faacdc2c90d82faac94a026e4664068502748507.png" width="394" height="80"><br>Also, you can read the leftmost bit as an output. In this case the register is completely empty, so you'll read 0 as output.</p>

<p>Now, say you want to input some data in the register: you can shift all bits to the left (but in this case nothing happens, since the box is already empty) and fill the rightmost bit with the input:<br><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e8ec5c29445514791eb1b2f9796b51b204b0f53c.png" width="444" height="85"><br>So, the register will become like this:<br><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c156b6e498e8a151995fb7aedb560ed5bd528843.png" width="376" height="61"></p>

<p>Now, if you shift again to the left (but with a 0-valued input):<br><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/5/57a6cff9501fb3e4ac9e62d6a460453e15f898b2.png" width="429" height="201"></p>

<p>You can see how it works, very basically.</p>

<p>Let's fast forward to a more interesting situation, with the box already "filled".</p>

<p><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/2/220723d883e1082664ceb340fb05b084225ce145.png" width="503" height="232"></p>

<p>If you shift left, the leftmost bit is discarded, and the input is inserted on the right.</p>

<p>This configuration is named SISO (serial in, serial out), but there's also SIPO (serial in, parallel out) that allows you to "load" the register one bit at a time and read all the bits together. <br>PISO (parallel in serial out) allows you to input data in one shot, and output bits one at a time,<br>PIPO (parallel in parallel out) not sure what it's used for, but it exists too.</p>

<p>My object sptnk/logic/shift register can do all of these configurations.</p>
