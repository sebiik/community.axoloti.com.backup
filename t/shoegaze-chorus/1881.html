        <p>Hi guys! </p>

<p>It's my first post, i just received my axoloti this week. I've been reading the community forum for a bit today, and i was eager to join and participate! </p>

<p>I don't know if there is a true 'introduction' topic, so i'll use that as my introduction:</p>

<p>I'm not a master at writing code as some of you guys seem to be (i got my brain turned upside down a couple of times by reading some of you :D), but i program weird vsts for myself sometimes as a hobby... Same thing with DIY/ soldering, i quite enjoy developping weird effects, and/or instruments for fun and share them with my musicians pals, but i really wouldn't call myself a pro haha! </p>

<p>I'm more into trying to make inspiring stuff that i can then use for my work, i'm a music composer working for publishers, brands, tv shows, singers... I'm always looking for character in gear, character that we can often miss from the usually (ab)used plugins/hardware... </p>

<p>I also got an audio 'brand' called Flo Audio, <a href="http://floaudio.bandcamp.com/" rel="nofollow">http://floaudio.bandcamp.com</a>,  where i share lots of impulses responses that i've either made myself (my own algorithms) or captured, mostly from exotic pieces of gear (at least i'm trying to haha)! </p>

<p>And now let me introduce you this humble patch: It's not my first patch on the axoloti, it's actually my third, but my first audio fx! I wanted to see if i could apply what i've gathered from working with the infamous PT2399 IC, + a wonderful piece of british hardware made in 1981 called the Powertran 'Digital Delay Line'. I'm really not sure i did everything 'right', some of you will maybe jump or facepalm when you see the image below, but it sounds good <img src="http://community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley.png?v=2" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> </p>

<p>There are basically two choruses, the first one is a regular chorus, and the other one has a longer delay time, i just added it as a layer to give the sound more density, feel free to mess with delay read time knobs and you got a separate vol knob for both choruses, so you can solo them and have your own blend.</p>

<p>I hope you can find it useful, don't hesitate to leave feedback!  </p>

<p>Flo</p>
