    <description>Hi guys! 

It&#39;s my first post, i just received my axoloti this week. I&#39;ve been reading the community forum for a bit today, and i was eager to join and participate! 

I don&#39;t know if there is a true &#39;introduction&#39; topic, so i&#39;ll use that as my introduction:

I&#39;m not a master at writing code as some of you guys seem to be (i got my brain turned upside down a couple of times by reading some of you :D), but i program weird vsts for myself sometimes as a hobby... Same thing with DIY/ soldering, i quite enjoy developping weird effects, and/or instruments for fun and share them with my musicians pals, but i really wouldn&#39;t call myself a pro haha! 

I&#39;m more into trying to make inspiring stuff that i can then use for my work, i&#39;m a music composer working for publishers, brands, tv shows, singers... I&#39;m always looking for character in gear, character that we can often miss from the usually (ab)used plugins/hardware... 

I also got an audio &#39;brand&#39; called Flo Audio, http://floaudio.bandcamp.com,  where i share lots of impulses responses that i&#39;ve either made myself (my own algorithms) or captured, mostly from exotic pieces of gear (at least i&#39;m trying to haha)! 

And now let me introduce you this humble patch: It&#39;s not my first patch on the axoloti, it&#39;s actually my third, but my first audio fx! I wanted to see if i could apply what i&#39;ve gathered from working with the infamous PT2399 IC, + a wonderful piece of british hardware made in 1981 called the Powertran &#39;Digital Delay Line&#39;. I&#39;m really not sure i did everything &#39;right&#39;, some of you will maybe jump or facepalm when you see the image below, but it sounds good :D 

There are basically two choruses, the first one is a regular chorus, and the other one has a longer delay time, i just added it as a layer to give the sound more density, feel free to mess with delay read time knobs and you got a separate vol knob for both choruses, so you can solo them and have your own blend.

I hope you can find it useful, don&#39;t hesitate to leave feedback!  

Flo
