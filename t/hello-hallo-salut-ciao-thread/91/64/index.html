        <p>Ahahaha nice to meet you again!! Yestrday I tried Axo on my laptop, now I'm moving it to my main DAW to start really using it, so, when I'll be a bit more confident with AXO I'll try the Virus driver also...yeah, I saw the thread this morning <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"><br>Now I'm trying to figure out why on this machine (win8.1 64) it works but doesn't compile the patches...I think it has to do with the default "Documents" folder located to a different HDD...I try a little bit more...<br>...by the way, a nice info for you all: my AXO is connected to Elektron Overhub and works <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"><br>Edit: I created the dir manually under C:\ ...now compiles &amp; works <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

        <p>Hi yall! electronic "musician" from sweden here, been doing alot of techno-ish tracks lately and also alot of sounddesigning and experimentation.</p>

<p>just ordered an axoloti board, after lookin at the nord modular for years (never could afford it and the editor seems like a hassle). Hoping that it will make nice addition to my quite humble hardware setup, both live and in the studio.</p>

        <p>Hi Axolotians! I'm Bob from Holland, city of Delft. Been making music all my life. After 25 of playing guitar I became interested in synths and sequencing (in the ninetees, Cubase on AtariST). Studied electronics for a few years. <br>My first "synth" was at age 10: an electronic experimenting kit for kids. Last year I build my first real synth, a Shruthi, from Olivier in Paris. When I read about Axo, I immediately ordered one. Been twiddeling ever since. Fascinating. Got myself a tiny labo on my desk. <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/4eedf67097d74b18d40b1d19c81c040242a9c20d" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4eedf67097d74b18d40b1d19c81c040242a9c20d.jpg" class="lightbox" title="workplace.jpg"><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/4/4eedf67097d74b18d40b1d19c81c040242a9c20d_1_666x500.jpg" width="666" height="500"><div class="meta">

<p>just bought an Axoloti board.<br>I'm a|x, from London UK. Been making electronic music as a hobbyist for a long time. Recently got into Euro, so I'm particularly interested in integrating my Axoloti into my ever-growing Eurorack setup.</p>

        <p>Hi, I'm Nicolas from Ghent, Belgium - Home of the Axoloti.<br>Just got my board yesterday, ordered it when I saw the Axo Control movie of Music Thing Modular (Tom Whitwell). I'm into music since I was born and the reason I bought this awesome do-it-all is the ability to make it whatever you want via software patching and still have the impression it is hardware and with the controls I will add (thanks to Thonk) the real knob turning experience. My home studio is mainly filled with analog synths (monophonic &amp; polyphonic) and I dream of wires (patching eurorack modules and others). I was DJ-ing at 15, released my first album and some ep's at 25, enjoying myself at the moment and releasing material when I have time to mix, master and finish all those snippets I record into Ableton. Almost nothing off course <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

        <p>Hi!</p>

<p>Are from Norway here. I got my Axoloti yesterday, and today I've been trying it out. Big fun! <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>I've been into programming, electronics and synths for 35 years now, both professionally and as a hobby. I just recently discovered the Axoloti, and just had to have one straight away. The fact that it's ARM based warms my old Acornist's heart. I used to do lots of ARM assembly programming on the Archimedes and Risc PC. Been programming some for the 56k, 21xx and 21xxx DSPs as well. </p>

<p>Apart from experimenting and having fun with the Axoloti, I plan to use it as the basis for a portable synth for those camping jams (well, that's also experimental and fun of course...).   </p>

<p>I'll see you folks around the forums.</p>

<p>Are<br>--</p>

        <p>Hi,</p>

<p>John from York here. I placed an order last week, so I'm waiting expectantly <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> I have a background in electronic engineering and software engineering (well, that's my job!) but am also interested in experimental music/noise/drone etc. as a performer. I've been using Reaktor for a number of years now, so I hope that the transition to the Axoloti patcher is not too painful.</p>

<p>I also have a set of Patchblocks which I have played with a little (however I have not explored them beyond making some simple generation patches). The kinds of audio synthesis/processing I am interested in doing is a little beyond the little PB devices <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>I have various recordings available on bandcamp (as namke communications) including last year's project which was to create a 'sound a day' - 365 pieces of music/sound later it is done and I have some spare time finally!!!</p>

<p><a href="http://namcom.bandcamp.com/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://namcom.bandcamp.com/</a></p>

<p>(Really looking forward to playing with Axoloti!)</p>

        <p>Hello! My name is Darren, from Port Huron, Michigan. I just received my first Axoloti in the post, as I think it's a better platform for what I want to do.</p>

<p>I'm 39 years old, and am a 4th-year EE student on an extended involuntary break (it's complicated), but continuing my education through projects. I have experience with analog electronics, coding, and FPGA/logic design. I have some DSP experience as well, but I've not practiced any of that lately.</p>

<p>My first project is going to be a drum inspired by the Korg Wavedrum, where audio from the head is used as input to the synthesis engine in various ways. I think the Axoloti could make it more powerful than the Wavedrum, though.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm hoping I can contribute to the development of this platform in some way or other. Thanks for reading this far if you have. <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

        <p>Hey, I'm from St. Louis Missouri. Just started getting into making electronic music, after having been a drummer in punk and metal bands for years. I went to school for sound for film and video, so I have a background in sound design/post-audio. Just got the axoloti up and running, so I'm excited to see what I can make with it.</p>

        <p>Hello,</p>

<p>Richard here in the London Borough of Islington. (UK) Recevied a board a few days ago and have started testing out a few different patches and slowly working up from the bottom of the learning curve. Mystified by plenty of the objects and the logic/math stuff but its all good fun so far. Spent the first few evenings getting it to work with a linux laptop.</p>

<p>No definite plans - play around with some fx set ups and weird synths see where that goes.</p>

<p>My respect to the developers and contributers to all this.</p>

        <p>Hello everybody</p>

<p>Hi, I'm Jan. I live in Switzerland near Zürich where I work as a software engineer. In my free time, I play the tenor saxophone, EWI and acoustic guitar. I made my personal VST-Plugins which I use to play live over a laptop, but intend to switch to Axoloti to get more reliability and low latency. My first impression of Axoloti is superb <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

        <p>Hello I’m Sean, born in Detroit, living in San Francisco and working as a sound pro. I have been a Modular synth freak for around 30 years and have been lucky enough to play on a wide range of classics and even work for a few notable synth companies and sold a lot of used stuff including circuit bendable toys at the MIT Flea. </p>

<p>Currently I am in the final stages of reconditioning a Kurzweil K2000 with full memory, USBfloppy, and SCSIsdDrive. Just waiting to buy the new bright screen. </p>

<p> I have been working with the Nord Modulars for around 12 yrs. First with the Micromodular which I still miss and later trading it in for a Nord G2 Engine. I am looking to start building an Axoloti setup to replace my Nord Modular Engine for playing out Live. I never had the nerve to do Modular Music gigs with my Nord G2 Engine because it was always too unique, useful, and rare. I want to stop treating it as sacred and get the Axoloti to hopefully be the set of modules that I want to play every day and everywhere.</p>

<p>The first mod I would like to do is a sort of Drum machine workstation version using a Beatstep for fingerpads but maybe drum trigger ins as well. Mount it in a fold open case and have a touchscreen tablet to run the editing software portably when you fold it open. I also have the guts to an Oberheim Drummer Perfx that I can put in for a fun sequencer source…that card can hold a lot of drum samples. But this is the kind of modular drum machine I have always wanted to make. The Low latency possible is very exciting in this particular application.</p>

<p>The other two projects I’d like are simpler. </p>

<p>One is putting an Axoloti in an existing keyboard like my Nord –red colored Axiom 49 or the Akai Max25. Somehow that red is cooler.</p>

<p>The third is a simple small boxing with Mic in and a few pots for control, to play w/ my keytar or windcontroller, basic FX etc. Maybe a Mic stand mount.</p>

<p>I figure with the three Axoloti they would be more than enough live modular gigging power that I could even busk with and not have to worry so much.</p>

        <p>Hello I am Bim.<br>Living in England. <br>I am a sound engineer by trade. <br>My axoloti is on its way. <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>I know my way round pure data fairly well and have dabbled with arduino in the past. </p>

<p>Overall I'm probably going to ask some pretty dumb questions whilst I find my feet with this platform.</p>
