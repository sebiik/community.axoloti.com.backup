        <p>Hello, <br>I'm Darryl but go by Phitar on forums and such.<br>Not a big poster. Big post reader though. If I read something that I think my input will positively impact or something I really like I'll jump in and say something. <br>About me: I'm not a musician but love electronic music.<br>Best guess would be to call me hobbyist. I will spend hours tweaking/testing and making sounds and if they make me happy then (guess what) I'm Happy. <br>I spent almost a year following the Axoloti website/forum before deciding to buy and join. I own two boards but have done little with them since about the time I decided to buy in I found I needed to find a new place to live. So right now my focus is looking for a new home for myself, my family and my gear.</p>

<p>Background : Former USN Sonar Tech,and  former application developer so I have experience in sound related electronics and computer application development.  Just nothing recent.</p>

        <p>Hello, I'm from southern France. I'm sorry about my bad english level.</p>

<p>I'm very exited to discover axoloti. I want to make some audio effects that doesn't exist in commercial things.<br>For example i try to make an auto-bass synthesizer that react to an audio input and witch is evolving by acting midi controls or other things.</p>

<p>I make techno music and love it. I tried pure data and i love the fact that we can use axoloti without computer when the patch is made. So it's a cool multi effect easy to carry.</p>

<p>i hope i don't make so much langage mistakes.</p>

<p>rave on...</p>

        <p>hello from Melbourne. finally got a chance to sit down with my 2 axoloti boards and dip into some rookie patching this eve. really excited. not that I had low expectations but wow this is a capable tool. </p>

<p>i'm using them alongside max. nice to spread the cpu load a bit and looking forward to figuring out a custom enclosure/controls.  </p>

<p>terrific work on this project and thank you! functional otb, stable software, help files for each object and a straight forward user guide. what more could you want really. a couple more boards I guess!</p>

        <p>Hi everyone! I'm Pablo, my axoloti is just arrived to Argentina. As far as I can see, the first in latin america. Isn't that cool?  </p>

<p>So, I finished installing the software and starting to see what this thing can do. <br>Bravo for the developers. Beautiful piece of gear. </p>

<p>I'm going to be there with a lot of questions about patching and electronics. I have my little experience, but it seems to that's going to take me some time..</p>

<p>See you!</p>

        <p>Allô!<br>Nice to meet all of you.</p>

<p>Alex, Québécois living in Ottawa. Sax player and ethnomusicologist. (Also: ethnographer and technopedagogue.)<br>While going through music school in Montreal in the late 1980s, had some fun experiences in a MIDI studio: DX7, Ensoniq EPS, Proteus, Performer, etc. We were also learning (about) electroacoustic composition. It was a great time to be adjacent to that scene.<br>Later on, friends introduced me to Csound, Max (pre-MSP), Turbosynth, Passport Alchemy, Music Mouse, etc.<br>Kept dabbling in several of these things. Bought a Yamaha WX-11 Wind Controller and TX81Z rackmount tone generator, as well as a Korg Poly-800. Tried them on occasion but never really got into them in any serious way.</p>

<p>On the software side, kept trying Pure Data, never getting the hang of it, for whatever reason. Very recently encountered Automatonism which was a real ear-opener. Been having a blast creating patches based on the overall modular synthesis concept.</p>

<p>Also started doing all sorts of musical stuff with iOS devices (first an iPod touch in 2008, then an iPad in 2010, then an iPhone in 2011). Followed blogs and podcasts about “mobile music making”. Had quite a bit of fun with a number of apps but, again, nothing which really stuck.</p>

<p>It’s really the Raspberry Pi which changed the game, for me, a little while ago. Was working as a technopedagogical advisor for Quebec’s higher education system and my colleague got the <span class="hashtag">#RasPi</span> bug, reconnecting with a background in electronics. My colleague went on to found Club framboise, a Raspberry Pi club in Montreal with antennas in Cameroon and Quebec City.<br>In my own case, the Raspberry Pi has reconnected me with my MIDI studio past. Sonic Pi was a key part of this. And now that the alpha version on macOS supports MIDI and OSC I/O, it’s really become my preferred tool for digital musicking.</p>

<p>Oh, and speaking of which, “digital musicking” is an important concept, for me. Even wrote an academic article about it (my first in, like, forever). It’s basically the audio side of digital making, so the Maker movement and all it entails. It also refers to all sorts of music-related activities as described by Christopher Small and Gilbert Rouget. Though “musicking” has existed as a word for a while, these scholars have used it to describe a broad range of behaviours associated with music. My way to put it is that if music performance is about playing music, musicking is about playing <em>with</em> music. Tapping your foot while music plays, singing in the shower, building playlists, and circuitbending are all musicking.</p>

<p>Which brings us back to Axoloti. Decribed my key Axo-related project <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/digital-wind-instrument/3342">Digital Wind Instrument</a>. But it should be obvious from my little intro here that the patcher and Core are likely to teach me a lot. Thinking of it as a hardware version of Pure Data is pretty useful. Backed the pisound campaign and should receive a Raspberry Pi HAT which will represent another approach to the same overall idea. Truth be told, the Raspberry Pi may be more of my thing, partly because of my learning process with Sonic Pi and Pure Data. </p>

<p>But my Axoloti Core is here now and it’ll be fun to play with it until the pisound HAT arrives. Afterwards, will probably use it as a dedicated device for my aforementioned project.</p>

        <p>Hi, I'm Christian. I live in the uk. I gave up making music years ago due to circumstances but handed over most of my gear to my son who got full use of it. Now i try to get back but with a different approach, which means dawless. I'm a huge Diy enthusiast and want to build most of the gear i want to use myself. The Axoloti is on it's  way, looking forward to using it. In the meanwhile I'm browsing this forum for ideas. Cheers</p>

        <p>Hello all,</p>

<p>My Name is Albert and I am living in The Netherlands. Started making music on two Korg MS-20's some 40 years ago. I have been an audio and lightning engineer for some time. Played keyboards in a new wave amateur group using a PPG Wave 2.2 in the 80's. Professionally I have been working as a Clipper programmer for some time. I also have some programming experience in assembler, VBA, C and C++. Musically I have been in retreat for some 10 years now. But now I opened up the flight cases again. And was glad to discover incredible new machines like the Roli Seaboard and the Axoloti. I will use the two Axoloti I bought to move my "expressive" sound ideas into my music creations.</p>

        <p>Hey guys,<br>my name is Stefan, I'm from Germany, but I've been living in Sydney (Australia) for over 9 years. I've been making music and sounds on a computer since early 2000, I play a bit piano and guitar.</p>

<p> I love electronic music but somehow it always draws me back to ancient stuff as in early renaissance to classical. doing some kind of canon or fugue with synthesised instruments has always got my attention. </p>

<p>To Johannes: when I got my axoloti last Christmas there was not a single day I haven't tinkered with it. I really thought this is going to be easy and it was for a while until thinks became more specific. I never wanted to learn C. I never wanted to dig so deep into DSP.<br> All I wanted was to build an instrument I can hook up on my piano and play. I ended up making my own objects now. I'm still learning C as far as my intelligence can carry me. You have brought something to us that is maybe not new but so tricky and challenging that I was left with nothing but learning, an experience that totally changed my view of learning itself, an experience that was and still is tremendously rewarding.  </p>

<p>And I want to thank you for that. I have probably read almost every post on this forum, some of them maybe more than a dozen of times. I made several dozens of patches mostly in FM or Wave tables. And the temptations were huge to get another one or two or three to expand. But thanks to its restrictions forcing me to stay creative and this very friendly  community I am withholding that and keep expanding my mind instead of becoming lazy (don't worry I'll get to those soon enough). </p>

<p>Again: Thank you!</p>

<p>Stefan</p>

        <p>Hi I'm Adrian based in sunny Sydney Australia. I have been making music with hardware for many years and am involved with a great studio space geared towards electronic music which you can check out here  <a href="https://analogcabin.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://analogcabin.net/</a></p>

<p>In the past I have tinkered with reaktor, a mico modular along with eurorack which I sold off due to limited funds. </p>

<p>I am interested in the stand alone nature of Axoloti and plan to adapt patches created by others at first and installing an axoloti into my UC-33 controller and creating / mapping a flexible environment so this midi controller becomes a hardware performance piece which is yet to be determined. I have so many ideas so will start sketching them out.</p>

<p>I have to say the forum and it's members have been very friendly in sharing their knowledge and creations with lots of varied approaches to things.</p>

<p>Looking forward to learning loads more. I'm off to check out the user guide <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>Hi friends. I'm chawps, a multi-instrumentalist living in Brooklyn. I'm really excited to start tinkering with the axoloti. My current goal is to build a hardware looper/sample chopper, sort of a computer-less mlr device. There seem to be quite a few resources in the community library for that project, so hopefully it will be a good introduction to the axoloti world.</p>

<p>From there, who knows!</p>

        <p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I realized that I have been asking a lot of stupid questions here and there around the forum but never introduced myself.  I'm Kat, and I live in the U.S.  I am an ex-research-astrophysicist taking up musical hobbies (obsessions) later in life than most of you, I presume.  I just started playing guitar a couple of years ago, and I've been building basic analog effects circuits for the last year.  I like the way that I can combine effects design with songwriting... not doing anything profound, just writing guitar rock that I can also "sink my brain into" on the back end, if that makes any sense. </p>

<p>While my audio-world and music-world experience is basically zero, I have decades of experience programming in a range of languages and doing lots of math-heavy signal processing.  Once I catch on to the right ways to think about audio signals and all the Axo-specific data types and whatnot, I suspect some of that skill set may be useful....??</p>

<p>Project-wise, the immediate thing I am using Axoloti for is delay and looping capability that I can tweak a bit more directly than with a commercial pedal.  But secondly, I'm interested in dynamic control of guitar effects, where the effect changes in response to things I am playing... I guess kind of thinking about songwriting itself a bit more like code, interactively designing effects algorithms as part of songs.</p>

<p>Also just want to be noisy on behalf of women who find this kind of thing really cool.  We exist!  There seem to be very few of us on this forum, which is depressing!</p>

        <p>Hallo,</p>

<p>I am from Norway but currently live in Tokyo, Japan. I am an electronics engineer and make music as a hobby. I guess I am more of a knob turner than anything else. Sure I some times make a finished track, but it is not the end result, it is the journey for me. I don't play any instrument but recently bought a LinnStrument as it was the first instrument design that I really felt I would want to learn. (I tried and failed both piano and guitar).</p>

<p>The axoloti's MPE capability was what made me buy it. I received it about a week ago and so far I have been having real fun when connecting it to my LinnStrument. They work really well together and I am impressed with the capabilities of this board and the amount of contributions from the community. I look forward to be part of it.</p>

        <p>Hello, Phil here. I'm an old software engineer from the UK. My interest in synths goes right back to the days of Switched On Bach, Moogs and VCS3s.</p>

<p>I recently sold my Nord G2 keyboard and then stumbled on the excellent Axoloti+Linnstrument demo on youTube. I had been lusting after a Linnstrument for some time, so it didnt take much pushing <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>My Axoloti turned up a week ago, great fun. My Linnstrument turned up today. Hoping for some funs times when I get home this evening. </p>

<p>cheers</p>

<p>Phil</p>

Sax player and ethnomusicologist. (Also: ethnographer and technopedagogue.)\u003cbr\u003eWhile going through music school in Montreal in the late 1980s, had some fun experiences in a MIDI studio: DX7, Ensoniq EPS, Proteus, Performer, etc. We were also learning (about) electroacoustic composition. It was a great time to be adjacent to that scene.\u003cbr\u003eLater on, friends introduced me to Csound, Max (pre-MSP), Turbosynth, Passport Alchemy, Music Mouse, etc.\u003cbr\u003eKept dabbling in several of these things. Bought a Yamaha WX-11 Wind Controller and TX81Z rackmount tone generator, as well as a Korg Poly-800. Tried them on occasion but never really got into them in any serious way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn the software side, kept trying Pure Data, never getting the hang of it, for whatever reason. Very recently encountered Automatonism which was a real ear-opener. Been having a blast creating patches based on the overall modular synthesis concept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlso started doing all sorts of musical stuff with iOS devices (first an iPod touch in 2008, then an iPad in 2010, then an iPhone in 2011). Followed blogs and podcasts about “mobile music making”. Had quite a bit of fun with a number of apps but, again, nothing which really stuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s really the Raspberry Pi which changed the game, for me, a little while ago. Was working as a technopedagogical advisor for Quebec’s higher education system and my colleague got the \u003cspan class=\"hashtag\"\u003e#RasPi\u003c/span\u003e bug, reconnecting with a background in electronics. My colleague went on to found Club framboise, a Raspberry Pi club in Montreal with antennas in Cameroon and Quebec City.\u003cbr\u003eIn my own case, the Raspberry Pi has reconnected me with my MIDI studio past. Sonic Pi was a key part of this. And now that the alpha version on macOS supports MIDI and OSC I/O, it’s really become my preferred tool for digital musicking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOh, and speaking of which, “digital musicking” is an important concept, for me. Even wrote an academic article about it (my first in, like, forever). It’s basically the audio side of digital making, so the Maker movement and all it entails. It also refers to all sorts of music-related activities as described by Christopher Small and Gilbert Rouget. Though “musicking” has existed as a word for a while, these scholars have used it to describe a broad range of behaviours associated with music. My way to put it is that if music performance is about playing music, musicking is about playing \u003cem\u003ewith\u003c/em\u003e music. Tapping your foot while music plays, singing in the shower, building playlists, and circuitbending are all musicking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhich brings us back to Axoloti. Decribed my key Axo-related project \u003ca href=\"//community.axoloti.com/t/digital-wind-instrument/3342\"\u003eDigital Wind Instrument\u003c/a\u003e. But it should be obvious from my little intro here that the patcher and Core are likely to teach me a lot. Thinking of it as a hardware version of Pure Data is pretty useful. Backed the pisound campaign and should receive a Raspberry Pi HAT which will represent another approach to the same overall idea. Truth be told, the Raspberry Pi may be more of my thing, partly because of my learning process with Sonic Pi and Pure Data. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut my Axoloti Core is here now and it’ll be fun to play with it until the pisound HAT arrives. Afterwards, will probably use it as a dedicated device for my aforementioned project.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":76,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-05-19T13:11:32.084Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"avg_time":21,"incoming_link_count":1,"reads":100,"score":101.05,"yours":false,"topic_id":91,"topic_slug":"hello-hallo-salut-ciao-thread","display_username":"Alex Enkerli","primary_group_name":null,"primary_group_flair_url":null,"primary_group_flair_bg_color":null,"primary_group_flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"http://community.axoloti.com/t/digital-wind-instrument/3342","internal":true,"reflection":false,"title":"Digital Wind Instrument","clicks":0}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"actions_summary":[{"id":2,"count":3}],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1278,"hidden":false,"hidden_reason_id":null,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":false,"wiki":false},{"id":20661,"name":"","username":"Christian","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/community.axoloti.com/christian/{size}/4143_1.png","created_at":"2017-05-19T19:29:10.286Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eHi, I'm Christian.

But secondly, I'm interested in dynamic control of guitar effects, where the effect changes in response to things I am playing... I guess kind of thinking about songwriting itself a bit more like code, interactively designing effects algorithms as part of songs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlso just want to be noisy on behalf of women who find this kind of thing really cool.
