        <p>Hello! My name is Darren, from Port Huron, Michigan. I just received my first Axoloti in the post, as I think it's a better platform for what I want to do.</p>

<p>I'm 39 years old, and am a 4th-year EE student on an extended involuntary break (it's complicated), but continuing my education through projects. I have experience with analog electronics, coding, and FPGA/logic design. I have some DSP experience as well, but I've not practiced any of that lately.</p>

<p>My first project is going to be a drum inspired by the Korg Wavedrum, where audio from the head is used as input to the synthesis engine in various ways. I think the Axoloti could make it more powerful than the Wavedrum, though.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm hoping I can contribute to the development of this platform in some way or other. Thanks for reading this far if you have. <img src="../../images/emoji/emoji_one/smilea4f0.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

        <p>Hey, I'm from St. Louis Missouri. Just started getting into making electronic music, after having been a drummer in punk and metal bands for years. I went to school for sound for film and video, so I have a background in sound design/post-audio. Just got the axoloti up and running, so I'm excited to see what I can make with it.</p>

        <p>Hello,</p>

<p>Richard here in the London Borough of Islington. (UK) Recevied a board a few days ago and have started testing out a few different patches and slowly working up from the bottom of the learning curve. Mystified by plenty of the objects and the logic/math stuff but its all good fun so far. Spent the first few evenings getting it to work with a linux laptop.</p>

<p>No definite plans - play around with some fx set ups and weird synths see where that goes.</p>

<p>My respect to the developers and contributers to all this.</p>

        <p>Hello everybody</p>

<p>Hi, I'm Jan. I live in Switzerland near Zürich where I work as a software engineer. In my free time, I play the tenor saxophone, EWI and acoustic guitar. I made my personal VST-Plugins which I use to play live over a laptop, but intend to switch to Axoloti to get more reliability and low latency. My first impression of Axoloti is superb <img src="../../images/emoji/emoji_one/smilea4f0.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

        <p>Hello I’m Sean, born in Detroit, living in San Francisco and working as a sound pro. I have been a Modular synth freak for around 30 years and have been lucky enough to play on a wide range of classics and even work for a few notable synth companies and sold a lot of used stuff including circuit bendable toys at the MIT Flea. </p>

<p>Currently I am in the final stages of reconditioning a Kurzweil K2000 with full memory, USBfloppy, and SCSIsdDrive. Just waiting to buy the new bright screen. </p>

<p> I have been working with the Nord Modulars for around 12 yrs. First with the Micromodular which I still miss and later trading it in for a Nord G2 Engine. I am looking to start building an Axoloti setup to replace my Nord Modular Engine for playing out Live. I never had the nerve to do Modular Music gigs with my Nord G2 Engine because it was always too unique, useful, and rare. I want to stop treating it as sacred and get the Axoloti to hopefully be the set of modules that I want to play every day and everywhere.</p>

<p>The first mod I would like to do is a sort of Drum machine workstation version using a Beatstep for fingerpads but maybe drum trigger ins as well. Mount it in a fold open case and have a touchscreen tablet to run the editing software portably when you fold it open. I also have the guts to an Oberheim Drummer Perfx that I can put in for a fun sequencer source…that card can hold a lot of drum samples. But this is the kind of modular drum machine I have always wanted to make. The Low latency possible is very exciting in this particular application.</p>

<p>The other two projects I’d like are simpler. </p>

<p>One is putting an Axoloti in an existing keyboard like my Nord –red colored Axiom 49 or the Akai Max25. Somehow that red is cooler.</p>

<p>The third is a simple small boxing with Mic in and a few pots for control, to play w/ my keytar or windcontroller, basic FX etc. Maybe a Mic stand mount.</p>

<p>I figure with the three Axoloti they would be more than enough live modular gigging power that I could even busk with and not have to worry so much.</p>

<p>I know my way round pure data fairly well and have dabbled with arduino in the past. </p>

<p>Overall I'm probably going to ask some pretty dumb questions whilst I find my feet with this platform.</p>

<p>Im really excited about the Axoloti. </p>

<p>Current list of noise-makers includes:</p>

        <p>Hello, <br>I'm Darryl but go by Phitar on forums and such.<br>Not a big poster. Big post reader though. If I read something that I think my input will positively impact or something I really like I'll jump in and say something. <br>About me: I'm not a musician but love electronic music.<br>Best guess would be to call me hobbyist. I will spend hours tweaking/testing and making sounds and if they make me happy then (guess what) I'm Happy. <br>I spent almost a year following the Axoloti website/forum before deciding to buy and join. I own two boards but have done little with them since about the time I decided to buy in I found I needed to find a new place to live. So right now my focus is looking for a new home for myself, my family and my gear.</p>

<p>Background : Former USN Sonar Tech,and  former application developer so I have experience in sound related electronics and computer application development.  Just nothing recent.</p>

        <p>I'll be checking back once mine arrives in Scotland, finally got round to ordering one - looking forward to knocking up my few 'bread and butter' usage cases and then beginning the exploring and contributing : )</p>

        <p>Hello, I'm from southern France. I'm sorry about my bad english level.</p>

<p>I'm very exited to discover axoloti. I want to make some audio effects that doesn't exist in commercial things.<br>For example i try to make an auto-bass synthesizer that react to an audio input and witch is evolving by acting midi controls or other things.</p>

<p>I make techno music and love it. I tried pure data and i love the fact that we can use axoloti without computer when the patch is made. So it's a cool multi effect easy to carry.</p>

<p>i hope i don't make so much langage mistakes.</p>

<p>rave on...</p>

        <p>hello from Melbourne. finally got a chance to sit down with my 2 axoloti boards and dip into some rookie patching this eve. really excited. not that I had low expectations but wow this is a capable tool. </p>

<p>i'm using them alongside max. nice to spread the cpu load a bit and looking forward to figuring out a custom enclosure/controls.  </p>

<p>terrific work on this project and thank you! functional otb, stable software, help files for each object and a straight forward user guide. what more could you want really. a couple more boards I guess!</p>

        <p>Hi everyone! I'm Pablo, my axoloti is just arrived to Argentina. As far as I can see, the first in latin america. Isn't that cool?  </p>

<p>So, I finished installing the software and starting to see what this thing can do. <br>Bravo for the developers. Beautiful piece of gear. </p>

<p>I'm going to be there with a lot of questions about patching and electronics. I have my little experience, but it seems to that's going to take me some time..</p>

<p>See you!</p>

        <p>Allô!<br>Nice to meet all of you.</p>

<p>Alex, Québécois living in Ottawa. Sax player and ethnomusicologist. (Also: ethnographer and technopedagogue.)<br>While going through music school in Montreal in the late 1980s, had some fun experiences in a MIDI studio: DX7, Ensoniq EPS, Proteus, Performer, etc. We were also learning (about) electroacoustic composition. It was a great time to be adjacent to that scene.<br>Later on, friends introduced me to Csound, Max (pre-MSP), Turbosynth, Passport Alchemy, Music Mouse, etc.<br>Kept dabbling in several of these things. Bought a Yamaha WX-11 Wind Controller and TX81Z rackmount tone generator, as well as a Korg Poly-800. Tried them on occasion but never really got into them in any serious way.</p>

<p>On the software side, kept trying Pure Data, never getting the hang of it, for whatever reason. Very recently encountered Automatonism which was a real ear-opener. Been having a blast creating patches based on the overall modular synthesis concept.</p>

<p>Also started doing all sorts of musical stuff with iOS devices (first an iPod touch in 2008, then an iPad in 2010, then an iPhone in 2011). Followed blogs and podcasts about “mobile music making”. Had quite a bit of fun with a number of apps but, again, nothing which really stuck.</p>

<p>It’s really the Raspberry Pi which changed the game, for me, a little while ago. Was working as a technopedagogical advisor for Quebec’s higher education system and my colleague got the <span class="hashtag">#RasPi</span> bug, reconnecting with a background in electronics. My colleague went on to found Club framboise, a Raspberry Pi club in Montreal with antennas in Cameroon and Quebec City.<br>In my own case, the Raspberry Pi has reconnected me with my MIDI studio past. Sonic Pi was a key part of this. And now that the alpha version on macOS supports MIDI and OSC I/O, it’s really become my preferred tool for digital musicking.</p>

<p>Oh, and speaking of which, “digital musicking” is an important concept, for me. Even wrote an academic article about it (my first in, like, forever). It’s basically the audio side of digital making, so the Maker movement and all it entails. It also refers to all sorts of music-related activities as described by Christopher Small and Gilbert Rouget. Though “musicking” has existed as a word for a while, these scholars have used it to describe a broad range of behaviours associated with music. My way to put it is that if music performance is about playing music, musicking is about playing <em>with</em> music. Tapping your foot while music plays, singing in the shower, building playlists, and circuitbending are all musicking.</p>

<p>Which brings us back to Axoloti. Decribed my key Axo-related project <a href="../digital-wind-instrument/3342.html">Digital Wind Instrument</a>. But it should be obvious from my little intro here that the patcher and Core are likely to teach me a lot. Thinking of it as a hardware version of Pure Data is pretty useful. Backed the pisound campaign and should receive a Raspberry Pi HAT which will represent another approach to the same overall idea. Truth be told, the Raspberry Pi may be more of my thing, partly because of my learning process with Sonic Pi and Pure Data. </p>

<p>But my Axoloti Core is here now and it’ll be fun to play with it until the pisound HAT arrives. Afterwards, will probably use it as a dedicated device for my aforementioned project.</p>

        <p>Hi, I'm Christian. I live in the uk. I gave up making music years ago due to circumstances but handed over most of my gear to my son who got full use of it. Now i try to get back but with a different approach, which means dawless. I'm a huge Diy enthusiast and want to build most of the gear i want to use myself. The Axoloti is on it's  way, looking forward to using it. In the meanwhile I'm browsing this forum for ideas. Cheers</p>

        <p>Hello all,</p>

<p>My Name is Albert and I am living in The Netherlands. Started making music on two Korg MS-20's some 40 years ago. I have been an audio and lightning engineer for some time. Played keyboards in a new wave amateur group using a PPG Wave 2.2 in the 80's. Professionally I have been working as a Clipper programmer for some time. I also have some programming experience in assembler, VBA, C and C++. Musically I have been in retreat for some 10 years now. But now I opened up the flight cases again. And was glad to discover incredible new machines like the Roli Seaboard and the Axoloti. I will use the two Axoloti I bought to move my "expressive" sound ideas into my music creations.</p>

        <p>Hey guys,<br>my name is Stefan, I'm from Germany, but I've been living in Sydney (Australia) for over 9 years. I've been making music and sounds on a computer since early 2000, I play a bit piano and guitar.</p>

<p> I love electronic music but somehow it always draws me back to ancient stuff as in early renaissance to classical. doing some kind of canon or fugue with synthesised instruments has always got my attention. </p>

<p>To Johannes: when I got my axoloti last Christmas there was not a single day I haven't tinkered with it. I really thought this is going to be easy and it was for a while until thinks became more specific. I never wanted to learn C. I never wanted to dig so deep into DSP.<br> All I wanted was to build an instrument I can hook up on my piano and play. I ended up making my own objects now. I'm still learning C as far as my intelligence can carry me. You have brought something to us that is maybe not new but so tricky and challenging that I was left with nothing but learning, an experience that totally changed my view of learning itself, an experience that was and still is tremendously rewarding.  </p>

<p>And I want to thank you for that. I have probably read almost every post on this forum, some of them maybe more than a dozen of times. I made several dozens of patches mostly in FM or Wave tables. And the temptations were huge to get another one or two or three to expand. But thanks to its restrictions forcing me to stay creative and this very friendly  community I am withholding that and keep expanding my mind instead of becoming lazy (don't worry I'll get to those soon enough). </p>

<p>Again: Thank you!</p>

<p>Stefan</p>

        <p>Hi I'm Adrian based in sunny Sydney Australia. I have been making music with hardware for many years and am involved with a great studio space geared towards electronic music which you can check out here  <a href="https://analogcabin.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://analogcabin.net/</a></p>

<p>In the past I have tinkered with reaktor, a mico modular along with eurorack which I sold off due to limited funds. </p>

<p>I am interested in the stand alone nature of Axoloti and plan to adapt patches created by others at first and installing an axoloti into my UC-33 controller and creating / mapping a flexible environment so this midi controller becomes a hardware performance piece which is yet to be determined. I have so many ideas so will start sketching them out.</p>

<p>I have to say the forum and it's members have been very friendly in sharing their knowledge and creations with lots of varied approaches to things.</p>

<p>Looking forward to learning loads more. I'm off to check out the user guide <img src="../../images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile30f4.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
