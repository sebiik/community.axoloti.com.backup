    <title>Error when installing Axoloti .msi file</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/error-when-installing-axoloti-msi-file/5193</link>
    <description>I just received my Axoloti core today. I followed the instructions for a normal installation (https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/installing-on-windows/36), including the instructions to have the runtime files copied to C:\Program Files (x86)\axoloti_runtime\platform_win. When I try to install the .msi file, when I get to the loading screen, I get an error message that says &quot;The system cannot open the device or file specified.&quot; When that error message is closed, another message immediately pops up that says &quot;The installer has encountered an unexpected error installing this package. This may indicate a problem with this package. The error code is 2755.&quot; I also tried to install the previous .msi file from Axoloti-1.0.12, and that doesn&#39;t fix the problem. I&#39;ve tried searching the forums but was unable to find a solution.
I&#39;m running a Lenovo Thinkpad Edge E520 with Windows 7 Professional, 64-bit. 
Thanks!</description>
