    <title>Question about internal flash memory cycles</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/question-about-internal-flash-memory-cycles/6225</link>
    <description>I&#39;m just wonder what will wear the least on the internal flash mem. 

1. Upload to SDcard as startup 
or 
2. Upload to internal flash

I wonder what actually happens when i do Upload to SDcard as startup? Will it then flash the internal mem with the patch file from the SD card every time i boot up the Axoloti in standalone mode? Taking one of the 10 000 write cycles on each boot?

I guess if i flash the internal flash mem from the Axoloti patcher it will only do that one time when i flash it, then only read from the flash mem on every other boot-up in standalone mode. 

also what about samples and tables i guess they are stored in different memoey... SDRAM? no need to worry about that right?

Thanks</description>

              <p>Great! Nice to know that i wont wear out my precious Axoloti flash by going live 100 times a day when i explore all the different modules <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> So it is the firmware updates that wear on the flash? <br>I will most certainly buy a few more Axoloti's before the flash wears out anyway...such a flexible machine and patcher, and great community!</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for the answer and for making this beast!</p>

<p>Have a good day</p>

<p>I understand your concern, but it is not an issue.<br>Patches (either live, from flash memory or from sdcard) are (equally) loaded into RAM to run. Otherwise there would be a performance difference between patches loaded live, sdcard or flash.<br>SRAM and SDRAM do not have limited write/erase cycles.</p>
