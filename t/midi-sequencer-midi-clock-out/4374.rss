    <title>Midi Sequencer + Midi Clock Out</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/midi-sequencer-midi-clock-out/4374</link>
    <description>Hi All, I&#39;m new to Axolotl. Are any of you creating midi sequences within the Axolotl to control other gear? I have a very simple idea to run a sequence that will control an Axolotl mixer to create automated mixing setup that processes external audio. I want the sequence to be in sync with other gear so I need to figure out if the Axolotl can generate a midi clock and send it out the midi jack. Also, I&#39;d like to know if one Axolotl could sequence another Axolotl? My setup would be something like this.

Axolotl A. runs the midi sequence to control multiple devices, including an additional axolotl. Midi out to the second Axoloti, and midi thru to the next midi device which needs to received the midi data and sync as well. 

Audio that is being input to both of the Axoloti&#39;s will be processed by the mixer according to the sequencer. 

I&#39;m also look for ideas on creating knobs that can adjust the sequencers settings. Clickable knobs preferred so that I can more easily select a specific setting. I imagine the most useful configuration would be to have one knob be a preset selector, so when selected many parameters will change such as BPM, how many measures the mixers sequencer operates before looping, things like that. Additional knobs might be useful to directly control the most often changes parameters of the sequence. Just to give some background, the purpose of the sequence is to create a pattern for the mixing levels to follow for each of the audio inputs.</description>
