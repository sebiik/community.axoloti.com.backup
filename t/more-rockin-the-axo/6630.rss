    <description>Hello everyone, 

Happy creating in quarantine!  I thought I would post a link to my rock band&#39;s new album, which was created with a pair of Axolotis playing a central role for both background synth/percussion sounds and guitar effects.  In some of the songs, I play two guitars at once... one &quot;normal&quot; guitar and a second &quot;ghost guitar&quot; which is dedicated solely to feedback, using a modulated bitcrusher effect through Axoloti that I control with a foot switch.  The songs also use Axoloti for random-number-generated bass synth and percussion, for sample looping, and so on.  Also any guitar effect that isn&#39;t the thick fuzz sound (which has to be analog ;)) is an Axoloti effect.  When we play live I also use a channel through one of the Axolotis for an echo effect on vocals, but that didn&#39;t translate as well in the recording so we only used it briefly in part of the song Grace.

Genre for this music is somewhere in the grunge-noise-shoegaze-sludge zone... just so you know what you are getting into!  But none of this would have been made without Axoloti, which is what lets a three-piece band get a huge layered sound, even playing live (back when that was still possible in Chicago).
