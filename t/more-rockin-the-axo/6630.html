        <p>Hello everyone, </p>

<p>Happy creating in quarantine!  I thought I would post a link to my rock band's new album, which was created with a pair of Axolotis playing a central role for both background synth/percussion sounds and guitar effects.  In some of the songs, I play two guitars at once... one "normal" guitar and a second "ghost guitar" which is dedicated solely to feedback, using a modulated bitcrusher effect through Axoloti that I control with a foot switch.  The songs also use Axoloti for random-number-generated bass synth and percussion, for sample looping, and so on.  Also any guitar effect that isn't the thick fuzz sound (which has to be analog <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">) is an Axoloti effect.  When we play live I also use a channel through one of the Axolotis for an echo effect on vocals, but that didn't translate as well in the recording so we only used it briefly in part of the song Grace.</p>

<p>Genre for this music is somewhere in the grunge-noise-shoegaze-sludge zone... just so you know what you are getting into!  But none of this would have been made without Axoloti, which is what lets a three-piece band get a huge layered sound, even playing live (back when that was still possible in Chicago). </p>
