    <title>Anyone experience with traveling by airplane with an Axoloti box?</title>

    <description>Hi,
This may sound as a strange and off topic question... 
Sunday I&#39;ll be leaving for Japan by airplane. I would like to take my Axoloti box (Axoloti built in an old box with lots of buttons etc on, and a lot of spaghetti wires inside.) I was wondering if anyone had experience with reactions of security checks and border crossing checks. 
I can imagine that some paranoia official will doubt about the purpose of the box and mistakenly see it for a hostile device. It would be painful and a sad day to see my beloved disappear in a trash bin...

Is there anyone experienced?
have a nice day!</description>

              <p>Hi guys,</p>

<p>thanks for the answers.<br>I just made it back from Japan. I can confirm one does not have to worry about traveling with a axo-box. I made it without any trouble.<br>Played my Axo-box around Japan in the airport, the train, hotel lobbies, etc. It is a great chat-starter indeed! <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>Great to be part of such a helpful and warm community,</p>

<p>grts!</p>

              <p>I always carry a battery pack and headphones so I could boot the axoloti and make it run a self playing patch or something..  If you can prove that it's an audio device you have less chances of getting in trouble..    I never needed to take my Axolotis out of their box or the backpack though.. <br>Btw.  one of the rules of the TSA is that if you carry a computer, this must be able to boot in order to get on board, so, try to leave some charge in the battery and take the charger in carry on. (they are also forbidden in checked baggage in some companies).<br>good luck!<br>S</p>

              <p>Don't worry about it. People with modulars has a much worse time. I have travelled with pretty much anything synth related from Axoloti to Nord G2 and never had any issues. </p>
