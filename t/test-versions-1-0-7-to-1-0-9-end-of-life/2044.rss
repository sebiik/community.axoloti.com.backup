    <title>Test versions (1.0.7 to 1.0.9) - end of life</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/test-versions-1-0-7-to-1-0-9-end-of-life/2044</link>
    <description>**This only affects users of the TEST releases prior to 1.0.10  , and users on 1.0.10 or the &#39;production release&#39; 1.0.6 are unaffected**

As we have previously stated, only the current TEST version of the axoloti software is supported, and we require users to upgrade to the latest test versions as soon as possible. this allows for incompatible changes to be made in active development, without supporting backwards compatibility to previous test versions, where it might incur significant development effort. (or is impossible due to conflict, e.g. we find a better way of doing something, which is the driver here)

This is important today, for 1.07, 8, 9 since I need to make a change to the community library that will &#39;break&#39; old test versions, which I plan to do in the next day or so.  

1.0.10 was release May 11th, so I think virtually all test users have upgraded, so this is mainly &#39;information&#39; just in case.
so if you have not upgraded to 1.0.10, then please upgrade now :) 

&quot;oh no, I can&#39;t... what happens if I don&#39;t ?&quot;
- you will no longer be able to sync with community library, either to get changes or push changes.
- if you do a reset library, then you will break your install.
- apart from this the software will still work.

of course, when you upgrade to the final release, or the latest test release, then everything will start working again :) 
(but follow the instructions, if you have outstanding changes in the community library)

I reiterate this is just for old test releases, and as mentioned on the test releases, this is something that should be &#39;planned&#39; for if you are using a test release.</description>

              <p>as no complaints/comments, this has now been done <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=2" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>axoloti-contrib now no longer has a master branch, its contents has been 'moved' to the 1.0.9 branch.</p>

<p>so now the community library mirrors the same organisation as the factory library, where each version of axoloti has its own branch.<br>(master IF re-introduced will like factory, become a development branch for testing only)</p>

<p>if you attempt to sync axoloti 1.0.7 to 1.0.9, you will probably get an error. <br>to resolve you should upgrade to 1.0.11, and re-initailise the libraries (preferences -&gt;reset all)</p>

<p>if you need to retrieve something from the 1.0.9 (aka old master) please PM me.</p>

<p>please note: developers I think axoloti now defaults to using the version branch, rather than master as before - if not then you can override the version in the library preferences. <br>also can I take the opportunity to remind you we have moved away from sub modules as per <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/important-changes-to-developer-mode-libraries/2043">this post</a>, so please delete these , as per this post, if you have not already.</p>
