    <title>Recover Patch from startup possible?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/recover-patch-from-startup-possible/5616</link>
    <description>Hi Forum, my first post here! Nice to have such a great community here! I tried to search for an answer but could not find one. Yesterday I was creating a patch and when I got some work done, I decided to try out the &quot;upload to SD card as startup&quot; funktion. I closed the editor and after a restart The patch was succesfully loaded and is playable without editor. BUT I then realised that I did not save the patch in in its last version and there was some tricky stuff done after the last save. I come from the Nord Modular Patching which lets you access the patch in the synth memory again after reloading the editor. So is it possible to access the startup patch in order to save it and refine it? Any ideas are very welcome! Greets, Chris</description>

              <p>no,that is not possible. the patch is compiled and then sent to the axoloti, converting back to an axp file is not implemented (and very hard to do)</p>
