    <description>Hi

I can&#39;t seem to get this to output anything that makes sense. Is what I am doing here correct?

And how does the patch get midi clock for the tempo delay based stuff?

<p>I just wired from the underside of the DT pcb to the midi terminals on the Axoloti. </p>

<p>Happy new years!</p>

              <p>As I said the demo is quite complex, notes and velocity trigger the effects, so you would have to program a sequence with different velocities and notes to see the effect (because as you know velocity has to be input on the digi trigger) the modulations can also be recorded and varied in that patch.....lots going on.</p>

<p>My advice would be to start small and go bit by bit, Glitchbeast has a lot of effects on offer, based on note triggers of the FXgates that gives you access to shedloads of awesome mangling, but, to begin, as a starting point it means too much going on.</p>

<p>Here is a really simple patch based on midi channel 1 for note triggers and cc modulation, with the top row of 4 encoders on the Digitakt changing parameters and the notes C5 (60) and C#5 (61) triggering the effect. based on the repeater and the ring mod, arbitrarily chosen by me....start here find out which fx you want/like best and then decide which parameters you want control over with the Digitakt's encoders, and which you want static, say set by a dial or modulated like in SSS's demo patch....explore that and build from there is your best bet</p>

<p>as an aside to quell my longing for an Octatrack, I have been on and off working on a patch based around SSS's Factotum for time stretching....that may well be another avenue for you to explore...I keep changing my mind about what I want though but I can upload a half-assed incomplete version, probably confusing as all hell for you to have a scan at....for now and maybe when I finally get my ass into gear and finish it I can upload the final version......it's not complex so don't get you hopes up....this is an old midi version as I started working on one that is based on gpio's and an oled, before finally deciding to migrate it all over to an Akso to make use of the extra resources offered by that board</p>

<p>.<a class="attachment" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4686db31b5e274467df175804cdedad7dccaf7f5.axp">OctaDT3.axp</a> (50.3 KB)</p>

<p>quick question for you, how have you physically wired the axoloti midi to you digitakt internally? To the Digitakt pcb? Is it Din or Usb?</p>

<p>Thanks for all your help earlier​<img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/grinning.png?v=5" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:"></p>

<p>I have everything up and running which means I can now use all the midi track buttons on the Digitakt as punch in effects like on a pocket operator or an OP-Z. Great stuff!</p>

<p>Now I just need to settle on which effects I want to use. For that the Glutch Beast seemed like the perfect thing. </p>

<p>But I just can’t get anything meaningful out of it. I found the demo patch in a forum thread but that doesn’t work either. </p>

<p>To trigger the effects I am just using simple midi notes which seems to work - the effects are triggered, but nothing really happens when they are triggered. And yes, I did turn up the mix at the bottom of the object. </p>

<p>Can you make it work? And if so - how?</p>

<p>Would love a helping hand once again​<img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/grinning.png?v=5" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:"></p>

<p>I think from memory SSS has a demo patch with midi clock all sorted, have you looked at that, hang on, yup here it is <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/sirsicksik-contributions/1731/556">http://community.axoloti.com/t/sirsicksik-contributions/1731/556</a></p>
