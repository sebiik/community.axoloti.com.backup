    <title>Experiments with light-controlled synth + guitar effects</title>

    <description>HI all,

This is just a little demo of something that I set up for a particular song (not to try to put together a whole light-based system or anything that ambitious).  I thought it might interest some people here so it was perhaps worth posting.  The other reason for posting this is as a preliminary introduction to the &quot;Betweener&quot; which is a project that I have been working on with collaborators here in Chicago for about a year now.  Betweener is a Teensy-based MIDI/CV and CV/MIDI controller retaining flexibility to do all the other stuff Teensy can do.  We are hoping to have the project (hardware and a simple arduino library) stable enough to share publicly to the DIY community in a few months, and I suspect it would be of interest to Axoloti folks, so I will definitely post here about it if that comes to pass.  

For me, as a guitar-player, the thing that Betweener adds is an interesting layer of interaction to couple Axoloti-based guitar effects to other systems.  Although I&#39;m not really much of a synth person, I picked up a Moog mother 32 a couple of months back and I have been using the Betweener to do a lot of fun programmable modulation of it. 

In this demo (extremely crude - just showing the ideas here, very quickly), I&#39;ve got Betweener taking input from an RGB color/light sensor and converting it simultaneously to a set of CV signals to modulate my Moog and a MIDI signal to control a synchronized tremolo layered over a couple of Axoloti guitar effects.  I am really liking the way it sounds to have the guitar and synthesizer synchronized as it is pretty confusing to the ear (although you really can&#39;t tell that from the crude video).

Update:  here&#39;s the actual song that I made out of this thing:
