    <title>Side project - &quot;Betweener&quot; - a cheap teensy-based MIDI-CV conversion and control tool</title>

    <description>Hey all,

I&#39;ve been meaning to post this here forever, but I guess I really really suck as a saleslady... I worked with some friends/colleagues here in Chicago a couple of years ago to make an affordable Teensy-based MIDI/CV converter and flexible experimental control platform (Eurorack compatible).  It isn&#39;t profoundly unique, nor cutting-edge, but we&#39;ve found that it is a very handy little device for placing between other parts of an experimental soundmaking system.  I really like using it with Axoloti to let Axoloti-based signals control an analog synth.   The Betweener was built with a pedagogical context in mind... I wrote a simple support library for it which is very heavily commented, for a student audience.

All info is open source of course but there are a few kits available too, and all the links are in the page shared below.  

Thought I should finally post this...for a summer when maybe a lot of people are going to be stuck in their houses more than usual, needing projects?
