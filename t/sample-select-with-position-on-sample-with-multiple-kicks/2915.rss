    <title>Sample select with position on sample with multiple kicks</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/sample-select-with-position-on-sample-with-multiple-kicks/2915</link>
    <description>Hey ,
I&#39;m pretty new to the axoloti.
I got it since tuesday.
I&#39;m trying to create a patch where i can load a sample with multiple versions of for example a kick , so that i can switch samples with a dial or button.
I want to be able to pitch the sample so i used &quot;table/play pitch&quot; .
The idea was that i loaded a sample with four ( or more ) kicks in line and use the position control to select the samples.
Like chopping up a break.
I get everything to play and the i can pitch the sample , but i can&#39;t get the &quot;setting the right position to select the next sample&quot; part to work.
I&#39;ve been trying different &quot;waves&quot; and &quot;size&quot; settings in the &quot;wavetable load&quot; and one setting seems to work better than the other but none works like it should.
Anyone have any idea&#39;s?
I&#39;ll post a screenshot of the patch.
Thanks

<p>So the wavetable objects are probably more suited for single cycle waveforms i understand.<br>That's something for a later project <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>So i found something that works for now but i can't help but think that it can be made even simpler .<br>The kicks in the loop are evenly spaced so the playback position should be the exact length of the loop divided into equal parts for the start position.<br>I'm going to do some more research.<br>Right now it's all a bit overwhelming <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>So what is the size number in the table/load objects?<br>Is it the total length of the sample in samples?<br>Is there a constant that goes past the decimal point?<br>Right now i'm using dials to go past it.</p>

<p>So here is a screenshot of the updated version that does wat i want for now.<br>It's a loop with four kicks placed on every beat of a 1 bar loop at 120bpm.<br>I replaced the "tb/wave/wavetable load" with "table/alloc 16b sdram load"<br><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/d408de879541457e57b340546687d43d3a1cfc92" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d408de879541457e57b340546687d43d3a1cfc92.jpg" class="lightbox" title="axoloti patch v2.jpg"><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/d/d408de879541457e57b340546687d43d3a1cfc92_1_690x359.jpg" width="690" height="359"><div class="meta">

              <p>table/play pitch is not for use with wavetables</p>

<p>if you want to use my wavetable load object you will need to use it with </p>

<p>tb/wave/wavetable play</p>

<p>this includes an inlet for the wavetable index.</p>

<p>if you click on help, on the wavetable load object, you will find a help patch which shows how its used, be sure to check the subpatch... as this includes the wavetable play object , since its polyphonic</p>
