    <title>Midi channels and MPE patches</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/midi-channels-and-mpe-patches/6479</link>
    <description>Can someone help me figure out what the &quot;midi channel&quot; selector does on a &quot;Polyphonic Expression&quot; (MPE) subpatch? I made the following observation: if I set the midi channel on the subpatch selector to channel 1, it will react to midi notes on channels 2-16, and to midi cc on channel 1. This is what i&#39;d expect.

If, however, i set the midi channel on the subpatch selector to channel 2 or higher, the subpatch won&#39;t react to _any_ midi notes, not on channel 2, or elsewhere (**unexpected!**). It will react to cc&#39;s on channel 2, though (expected).

(all of this regards a main patch set to channel 1)

This is the end of my question.





And here&#39;s why i&#39;m interested in this, if anyone has any other ideas:

I have an MPE keyboard on the USB port, and a regular midi keyboard on the DIN. I want to

1. have the patch react to program change messages from the DIN port (and preferably, but not necessarily, also the USB port)

2. have midi cc&#39;s from the DIN port ignored

3. controll a Polyphonic Expression subpatch from the USB port as usual, while 

4. being able to toggle between ignoring or using addiotional midi notes from the DIN port

Towards achieving 4, i have constructed a subpatch that will resend midi notes from the DIN port, channel 1, to channels 2--16; that patch works fine, what i&#39;m struggling with is getting the program change message from DIN, while ignoring the midi cc&#39;s from the DIN.

Any help is appreciated. Just in case, i&#39;m including a the patch that i used for diagnostics.
