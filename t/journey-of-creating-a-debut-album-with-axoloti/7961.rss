    <description>I&#39;m recording an electronic music debut album. Most of the synth and drum sounds are produced with two Axolotis.

First single was just released on Spotify. 
Check out if you&#39;re interested:

A harmonious fusion of pulsating rhythms, tranquil cosmic ambience, and earthy electronic melodies

&quot;Neural Punch,&quot; the first single from Circuit Horizon&#39;s upcoming debut album, fuses retro sounds from 80s and 90s electronic music with contemporary and futuristic elements, aiming to create a unique and genre-defying sonic landscape.
