    <title>Tempo Syncable Delay with Tables</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/tempo-syncable-delay-with-tables/2347</link>
    <description>I&#39;m currently building a multitrack looper using @rbrt&#39;s looper blocks. 
I also want to integrate a simple delay patch but since I want to get the maximum loop time I have no sdram left for the delay objects. To get around this my Idea was to build a delay with tables that uses the very last part of the table I&#39;m using to record the loops.

Has anyone created something like this before?

Fyi rbrts looper blocks allow to use one table and divide into several slots that you can record into. when reading out the tables there is a special phasor that can be given and offset and a range in wich it should read out.

So the main idea here is having something that continuosly records to the last part of table and reads it out, with a feedback circuit. Unfortunately there is no object that contiuously records, so I used parts of this patch:http://community.axoloti.com/t/multitrack-looper-with-variable-modulation-loop-lengths/1166
to make this happen.
I&#39;ve got it running but only at a fixed time. My main problem is setting the delay time now. 

If you look at the patch its maybe easier to understand. (or maybe not)
