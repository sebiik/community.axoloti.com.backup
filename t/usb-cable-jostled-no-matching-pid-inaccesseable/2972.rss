    <title>USB cable jostled - No matching PID - &quot;inaccesseable&quot;</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/usb-cable-jostled-no-matching-pid-inaccesseable/2972</link>
    <description>So tonight I discovered two of the USB ports on my laptop don&#39;t have a particularly tight fit.  I can easily jostle the USB connection at the laptop quite easily and the device disconnects only for a short time and then reconnects almost immediately. 

The issue is that the Axoloti patcher loses connection, patch stops working, and then is unable to reconnect.

Each time it said something to the tune of &quot;no devicing with matching PID[...] found&quot; ([...] denotes some other text I can&#39;t remember.) followed by &quot;inaccesseable -4&quot; at first and later &quot;inaccesseable -12&quot;.

The Firmware Rescue process didn&#39;t work - even after starting with S1 held it tells me the PID doesn&#39;t match.  

Rebooting my laptop worked, no flash rescue required and I&#39;m back to normal.  Would be mighty frustrating if I had to reboot every time I knocked the cable :)

I could reproduce the problem and copy/paste the log file if requested.

Update: Running the latest Windows 10</description>

<p>hmm this implies the windows driver (its a standard windows driver, not supplied by axoloti) has got into a weird state, or perhaps libusb.</p>

<p>does axoloti reconnect, if you remove it completely, so powered down and then reinsert?<br>(perhaps after waiting a while!?) </p>

<p>also if you stop the Axoloti UI, and then restart it, does it work?</p>

<p>btw: if its that loose, Id be a bit careful, you do not want axoloti to lose power whilst its doing a firmware upgrade.</p>
