    <title>Seeking assistance with physical modeling patches</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/seeking-assistance-with-physical-modeling-patches/7427</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve made a few concept patches for a very (very) stripped down version of the lmnts patch. Not even necessarily lmnts but some sort of dynamic physical modeling engine that uses a resonator (understanding that any &#39;true&#39; physical modeling is greatly limited by the processor). My attempts have been unsuccessful. 

Pictured below is what I&#39;ve tried thus far. Essentially a dirac going into multiple band pass filters all fed into a mixer before going into a reverb. I also tried the same but with @SirSickSik pResonator object. With my attempts they all made interesting noises, but not the characteristic sounds attributed to physical modeling. My failure to get good results is mine alone and in no part of the objects I&#39;m using. 

Apparently the Elements/Rings resonator is a series of 64 bandpass filters. I&#39;m guessing that to get anywhere near those beautiful tones coming from those devices I need far more in my patch. However, before going further I wanted to see if anybody had any patches of their own where they fiddled around with physical modeling.

There&#39;s a thread elsewhere on the forum about it, but the people there are talking more on the math/DSP side of things which is going to be necessary eventually, but for now I&#39;m just not very good at coding, especially math heavy stuff.

              <p>Following up on my progress with this. I've tuned 64 "filter/bp svf m"objects so that the filter frequency of each one is a value of 2 higher than the one before it. This is still not at all finished, but everything outside of this is beyond my current purview, though learn I shall. In my vertical video (sorry) I'm sending a saw wave with a short decay from my minilogue directly into the Axoloti using this resonator patch. It's not modeling any physical objects, and it's clipping like crazy, but I think it sounds pretty cool! </p>
