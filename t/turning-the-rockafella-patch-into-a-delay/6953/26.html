        <p>Yeah, <a class="mention" href="../../../u/blindsmyth-2.html">@Blindsmyth</a> is right and giving real life examples was probably a better idea than me trying to explain it in broken English! So I don't want the stretch to happen live, as there's no way to process the signal in real time. You can't speed up what hasn't been recorded yet, etc. The patch Blindsmyth posted above the Clouds one is pretty much all the way there for me. All I need from that is a way to set the endpoint of the table, or where the table is supposed to stop playing, go back to the start of the table and play it again, because right now it's always scrubbing through the wholet table and I only get to hear the part I "choose" to hear with the "time" knob hooked up to "range" parameter. If anyone knows how to set the endpoint/set a reset/return to start of table, I'd greatly appreciate it. <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/blushae52.png?v=5" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"></p>

        <p>Hey, thanks for the heads up. They look way more complex than what I need (only have 4 knobs (5 with mix), one footswitch and two toggles available for this mode I'm trying to make), but I will try them out and see if I can strip them down to something I can use. It also seems like he made a looper rather than a delay, which is what I'm aiming for, still always helps to look at other people's workflow to try to make sense of it and learn new things!</p>

<p>Sent him a DM/PM as well, in case he knows a trick or two to getting closer to the desired result <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/blushae52.png?v=5" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"></p>

        <p>It seems <a class="mention" href="../../../u/sirsicksik-2.html">@SirSickSik</a>'s Factotum object does everything you need, or i'm missing something ? It does loop and delay, has feedback (or overdub), stretch and reverse, and you can adjust the length with a knob... Or Just record a specific duration with a toggle/switch, like a plain looper.</p>

<p>Another approach would be a blend of <a class="mention" href="../../../u/rbrt.html">@rbrt</a>' s objects like ldrive, ldub, lrec... You could then turn your delayed signal into a stretch by triggering ldrive's play input at a specific rate (like, fast) and slowly move the loopstart... Or use many objects like in jt's grainy-table patch to have a polyphonic / more blurry / spectral-ish sound.<br>A bit more complex but very flexible. And <a class="mention" href="../../../u/rbrt.html">@rbrt</a>'s objects are well documented...<br>Hope it helps.</p>

        <p>Thanks for replying! I guess I haven't gotten foctotum to work that well before and just gave up on it. I should check it out again then! </p>

<p>As far as the other more complex solution goes, wouldn't moving the loop start result in the same problem I had with the rockafella+ldub solution, but in reverse? Won't it still scrub so I'm left with silence in the beginning of the table rather than the end? Or, like, shift the delay time in a way? Maybe not.</p>

        <p>Not sure I understand your question. The best is to try different methods, so you'll learn quicker.<br>What I like with jt's grainy-table is it's quite didactic.<br>It explains in a simple way how granular / freeze works. It's easy to mod. <br>To me, it's more interesting than a ready-made object (though Factotum is amazing). <br>And, to repeat myself, it can be very powerful if coupled with rbrt 's objects, as they' re great for building loopers/Delays (which are quite the same, in this digital world. A 100% feedback is just an overdub).</p>

<p>Then you'll probably get interested in further concepts like using timers, windowing... And you'll become the Grains Master.</p>

        <p>That is super fun! </p>

<p>When I speed up the sample it gets real bitcrushy though, which I like a lot, really cool! It does some weird stuff though, like if I change the pitch back and forth it just stops playing and recording. Same with chunk size. Also, there's as if it remembers a loop I played a long time ago and still plays that when I hit the record toggle after loading the patch back up (going live), then it loops it once and they all I get is this wall of sound coming from what sounds like a single grain at very high volumes. Scared the crap out of me the first time it happened, haha! <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/open_mouthae52.png?v=5" title=":open_mouth:" class="emoji" alt=":open_mouth:"> edit: That sample is still in there 30 minutes later, even if I've played a bunch of times and the patch has acted normally, suddenly it recalls that one sample, plays it once and they goes into that crazy loud one grain sample thing. So strange!</p>

<p>The feedback part works really well though! How do I set the "delay time" though? Like, the lenght of the table? I see there's an end inlet now, but what's controlling it and how to I make it controlable with a knob? Also, the reverse option is gone, which I really liked on the rockafella. Is there a way of getting that back in there?<img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/sweat_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:"></p>

<p>I'm really sorry for these stupid questions. I guess tables just confuse me like crazy. <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/persevereae52.png?v=5" title=":persevere:" class="emoji" alt=":persevere:"></p>

        <p>Do I only use the controls at the top of the patch? </p>

<p>Below is a patch modified to be able to change the length of the delay, but be carefull, reducing the time should work, extending it will inevitably produce strange things... but you ask for strange things ! <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

        <p>Yeah, I only used the three dials on top plus the "rec" toggle, which I assume is my bypass switch in this case. I'll peep the new one you posted in the morning! Awesome work! Thanks again!</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, it's still acting super strange.</p>

<p>I'm still only messing with the dials on top. Sometimes it will record, other times not, sometimes you get layered sounds on the repeats, other times the new thing you play overwrites the previous layer. If you don't play exactly when the table starts ( I assume), it cuts out everything you played before the table started recording/playing.</p>

<p>Lenght knob I don't even know how works at all. Putting that dial high gives me no sound at all. It gives a short repeat if you put it really low, but anywhere between low and high gives the same delay time, it seems. </p>

<p>It does a weird tremolo thing with the chunk size param which sounds and acts very different from rockafella (which I just tried again to listen and confirm).</p>

<p>Feedback works sometimes, but it's not really fading things out, it just stops playing at some point abruptly. Sometimes with feedback on full, it never plays anything. I really appreciate the effort, but something is really ducky with this patch. <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/roflae52.png?v=5" title=":rofl:" class="emoji" alt=":rofl:"></p>

        <p>Moving the 'length' button at the top of the patch to make it easier to understand (after testing and just before posting it...) changed the control flow. This explains why the recording didn't seem to work (in fact, the recording worked but the playback didn't work well). I'm sorry, I should have thought about it. <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/confusedae52.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

<p>Concerning the 'length' button, strange things are bound to happen, as explained in the previous posts. Blindsmyth's idea is to use a "fading" looper to create a delay. Decreasing the length is not a problem. Increasing the length necessarily creates artifacts (time to record on the empty part).</p>

<p>I don't see why the "chunk size" parameter sounds different but I'll see if I have some time.</p>

<p>Concerning the "feedback", I don't have anything to reproach it for. I think it must work because nobody has made any remarks to rbrt about this object.</p>

<p>I hope the problems you are having are related to the recording problem. I think you need to try to understand how it works so that you can adapt it to your needs. You will also understand some strange things you hear because reading at different speeds a table recorded at a fixed speed will produce strange things!</p>

        <p>I do wonder though, if it is possible to tell it when to stop recording and go back to the beginning and start recording again, because right now, that's not what it does. It still takes the length of the buffer for it to accept and record new input, which is well, interesting, but really weird in practice.</p>

<p>Say I have a 10 second table buffer and set the range/length to max, it will work "normally", aka it records everything I play and plays it back to me. But when I move the delay time to, say 1 second, I will get 1 second of delay time (and repeat that if feedback is up), but it won't record anything again before the table is over. So every 10 seconds it will record, but everything in between that is just lost. It still has to run through the whole buffer before it records again. There must be (?) a way to tell it to reset the "recording head"/go back to start and record again without having to wait for the buffer to finish being run through. No? <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/roflae52.png?v=5" title=":rofl:" class="emoji" alt=":rofl:"></p>

<p>edit: disregard this. I was messing with Factotum when I wrote this. Mad brainfarts today. But, regardless, if anyone can add a endpoint thing to Factotum like Jerome did to this object, that would be most welcome.</p>
