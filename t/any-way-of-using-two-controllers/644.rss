    <title>Any way of using two controllers?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/any-way-of-using-two-controllers/644</link>
    <description>Hi, 

I have a Nanokontrol 2 and a LPK25 and I would like to connect both to the Axoloti. One would be for sending CC messages and the other would send only notes.
Is it possbile to connect one to the USB port and the other one to the Micro USB? From what I have found on this forum I believe I can´t because the micro USB can´t act as a Host port, but I would like to ask anyway.
Is there any other way this could be done? I have thought of:

   1. Get / make something that receives usb midi and converts it to DIN5 midi with an arduino for example, and connect one controller to the USB port and the other one to the MIDI port. I don´t know if this is going to work since I would have to give power to the LPK25 through usb, and I don´t even know if that can be done in Arduino.

   2. Use some kind of usb merger, since one controller would be sending CC and the other one notes, the messages they send would be different, but I´m guessing that if I´m pressing a key on the LPK 25 and I want to turn a knob in the Nanokontrol the messages would collide and it would act weird.

Any other idea besides selling them both and buying a controller that has keys and knobs and faders?</description>

              <p>Thanks man! No need to apologize for anything, what you have made is unbelievably good, it had to have some limitations somewhere :D. Besides, if it is in the firmware I´m sure someday there´ll be support for HUBs. I wish I could help with that, but I´m afraid it is way beyond my reach.</p>

<p>I have been looking around and it seems that the Behringer BCR2000 could be a great option. It has a ton of knobs, midi-out, and it is relatively cheap, so I think I´ll be looking for a second hand unit.<br><a href="http://www.music-group.com/Categories/Behringer/Computer-Audio/Desktop-Controllers/BCR2000/p/P0245/Features#More-Than-Just-a-Prety-Set-of-Knobs" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.music-group.com/Categories/Behringer/Computer-Audio/Desktop-Controllers/BCR2000/p/P0245/Features#More-Than-Just-a-Prety-Set-of-Knobs</a></p>

<p>Thanks a lot!</p>

              <p>The micro-USB port is device only. And the host port does not support USB HUBs. So currently there is no way to connect two USB-MIDI controllers, sorry. This limitation is in the firmware.</p>

<p>For USB host on Arduino, you need a Arduino Due or a USB host shield. And find or write support for USB-MIDI...</p>

<p>Kenton MIDI USB Host is an off the shelf solution to convert USB-MIDI to DIN Midi.</p>

<p>But I would suggest to complement one USB-MIDI controller with a DIN MIDI controller. Older MIDI controllers can often be found 2nd hand for little money, perhaps a Doepfer Pocketcontrol, Evolution UC33, or Faderfox LV2...</p>
