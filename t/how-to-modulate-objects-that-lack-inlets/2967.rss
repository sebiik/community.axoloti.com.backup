    <title>How to modulate objects that lack inlets?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/how-to-modulate-objects-that-lack-inlets/2967</link>
    <description>Hi, Axoloti Community!

My first post here is a real noob-style question, one I&#39;m surprised I have to ask, but I&#39;m a bit confused by the lack of inlets on objects that require them in order to modulate their parameters.

Take the object **fx/lmnts/reverb** for example.

I think It&#39;s a great object, and with lots of control via it&#39;s on-screen dials.  But what&#39;s confusing me is how I&#39;m supposed to use this object in the true spirit of Axoloti, meaning the ability to control it when Axoloti is away from it&#39;s GUI, independent of the computer.

I thought about using it to build an Axoloti-powered rack-mountable reverb unit, but then noticed the lack of inlets to modulate the parameters.  Without inlets, I don&#39;t understand how I&#39;m supposed to wire-up external hardware knobs to the board in order to control it.

I understand that some objects have more specific uses.  For example, an on-screen boolean display object is useful when developing a patch, but pointless on an independent Axoloti.  But the reverb object in this example, is no such object.  It&#39;s an object which, being part of the Axoloti object library, should be fully exposed to the patching process of Axoloti via inlets for it&#39;s parameters.

The way it is (and many other objects are) makes these objects feel half-baked in that they&#39;re not true integrators of the patching environment if we cannot modulate their parameters.  What I love about Axoloti, the spirit of Axoloti, is that it would free me from the computer environment once the design process is complete.  But having objects that require the Axoloti Patcher in order to control them, completely goes against that spirit of independence, and hinders their use away from the computer.

Or at least, that&#39;s what it feels like.  So that kinda sums-up my question really, is there something obvious I&#39;m not aware of, like maybe there&#39;s a way to expose dials as inlets, or something to that effect?</description>

<p>I dont think thats what i said <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> <br>what I said was the parameters work within certain ranges, which I'm trying to sort out a bit...<br>also its possible that you can modulate parameters faster than the MI code is designed (e.g. where there are only knobs not input jacks), this may have side effects, either audio artefacts or increased cpu.<br>... again we should keep discussion on the other thread.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the heads-up, adnauseam, I think we cross-posted!</p>

<p>Yeah, been reading technobear's posts about the MI modules.  I'm very thankful to technobear for bringing them to the Axoloti platform, and to MI for making them available to us.</p>

<p>Up until now, the only reverbs in my setup were all had from a Yamaha A3000 Sampler, which I use as an effects processor.  It has three completely independent blocks for it's effects, and it's reverbs, while they can be nice if tweaked well, don't sound as nice to me as the MI Elements Reverb, which sounds very smooth!</p>

<p>About the <strong>patch/modsource</strong> object, yeah, that's definitely something that should be pointed out with neon lights to save noobs a lot of head-scratching <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=3" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

              <p>I think Sputnki is correct. You want to use a mod source object. And I think most parameters can be affected via some sort of presets (I'm not entirely sure, I'm a little green)</p>

<p>I believe the Mutable Instruments modules are still being debugged, tested by the community, and tweaked to work properly. Technobear has spent a bit of time doing this so you may find it interesting to read some of his posts on how the work is going.</p>

<p>I did a bit of searching re: the modsource stuff and it seems almost indespensible when the modules have no inputs!  You learn something new every day!</p>

              <p>Ah, I already tried right-clicking the dials, but was left scratching my head due to not being aware of the <strong>patch/modsource</strong> object.  I think I underestimated how well developed this environment already is.</p>

<p>That's great, thanks Sputnki!</p>
