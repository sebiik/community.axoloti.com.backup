    <title>Large set of constants, most economical way to store/recall?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/large-set-of-constants-most-economical-way-to-store-recall/2358</link>
    <description>hi there,

I have 5 filters (bandpass) and 5 vca&#39;s following them. 

I want to control filter frequency and vca levels of those five filters via previously stored values that i recall. I have 125 filter parameters and 100 gain parameters. what is the most efficient way to store and recall this values? I need to recall two sets of values for each filter (e.g. 200 and 800 hz and -4 and -12 db and crossfade between them) I tried with a set dial, which is easy to recall and works perfectly, but I am quickly running out of ram and it is also a waste because I don&#39;t need to change the values while running...is a table the solution? one big table for all values? can I read multiple values from the table at the same time via multiple reads? I wanted to ask for advice before I program the whole logic around the table read only to see I hit the same limitations :slight_smile: or should I program a custom object with a big array in it?


thanks for any insights</description>

              <p>as I remember the preset manager saves more or less the whole patch and reloads that from the sd card, right? will check it out though... I need a solution, that works instantly, no audio dropouts or something, so I think a preset system is not going to work.</p>

              <p>That is a pretty huge amount of parameters. If you want to try a solution without writing a new objects, I'd suggest trying out <a class="mention" href="/users/drjustice">@DrJustice</a> preset manager, called<br>drj/patch/preset_manager</p>

<p>That doesnt use much ram or DSP for that matter. The presets are stored in the track folder on sd card. </p>

<p>You should read his notes carefully since it has got 3 different modes, that acts differently. For example one of the modes will break any saved presets if you move any objects around. What is special about that mode is that it saves the integer spinboxes in the presets too. But you dont really need that option, you can do with , was it 4 dials? So you should be good with one of the other modes.</p>

<blockquote><p>The preset manager has been updated. This new version have two new features:   1 - Saves parameters as name/value pairs [1], and so it should not be dependent on the order/placement of objects in the patch.   2 - Introduces a new attribute called "savemode". The "Global" mode allows a single preset manager to save all parameters in the patch, including all sub patches. The "SubPatch" mode works like the previous version, except for point 1 above.   Edit: I just added a third save mode "SubPatchV…</p></blockquote></aside></p>

<p>I think that could be a good, effective solution <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
