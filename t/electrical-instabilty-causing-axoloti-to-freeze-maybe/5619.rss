    <description>Hi community!
I&#39;ve had a (rarely) recurring issue with my axoloti live set-up during my otherwise super happy years of giggin&#39; with it, and I think it&#39;s just about time to address it.
Basically, one or more of the axolotis in my 3/4 axos setup sometimes freeze during performance, and I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s related to current instabilty in the amplifiers they&#39;re connected to. The axos are powered via a separate 12v battery, and the amps are 2 high quality AER acoustic amps (so change the amps is not an option :) ), but the thing happens when the washing machine starts (at home, not too bad) or coffee machine (during pub concerts, rare but embarrassing to say the least).  I&#39;m fairly ignorant in electronics so I&#39;m asking for help!! What could I do to reduce such unpleasant events?</description>

              <p>Extra-late comeback: due to major changes in my live setup I've gone for two boards with isolated power from a multi-powersupply instead of three boards daisy-chained and suddenly everything was fine. I couldn't recreate the freezes no matter what I tried. Hooray and thanks anyone for the help!</p>

              <p>Hello. Ok, you're getting EMI in the form of transient pulses from high current switching of motors and heaters and the filter seems to work. These are high frequency and a mains filter is designed to deal with them. A DI box is mostly for mains hum and ground loops, it might filter transient pulses but they're not really designed to and will possibly just allow them through.</p>

<p>A cheaper fix might be a <a href="https://www.parts-express.com/Data/Default/Images/Catalog/Original/110-454_HR_0.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener">ferrite bead</a> around the audio cable, like on video cables. If you look around the house, you may find one that can be unclipped from another cable. I think the mains filter should be the first line of defence though on all mains connected equipment if you're going out to various venues to perform - also on mains PSUs to the Axoloti.</p>

              <p>That's what I'm asking... I only have a shitty 15â‚¬ DI and my setup is stereo, and also the aer alpha plus has a mic input which sounds very different from the instrument input so I can't really test out the whole system. (Keep in mind this is a rare occurrence, I basically will have to see what happens in months to be quite sure) So before buying something I'd like to have more informed opinions. The transformer isolator I linked should work as an unbalanced DI (I might be very wrong though...)

<p>Thank you for taking the time to look into that! They're expensive indeed, but you never know... they might have overlooked the mains filtering. I already have a multiplug with a EMI filter inside somewhere, I'll try it. I had even forgot that those things existed, thank you.</p>

              <p>hmm, my gut feeling tells me that you will actually have more issues, when you power the boards from battery and connect them to an amp that is connected to mains. a sudden drift off the ground (coffee machine, handdryer) could well lead to some issues that could vanish if the boards were also powered by mains power. i have no proof for this though</p>

              <p>I'm already powering the axos from a 12v battery (that's the reason I think the problem comes from the amp - wich are connected to the main), but they're daisy chained. As a cheap experiment i'll try to shield the existing box with copper foil and ground it. BTW that powersupply look very interesting,and very busker-friendly as well!<img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>Hmmm in that case I would just try all the options available. I use plastic or wood enclosures too but I cover the inside with copper or aluminium foil and connect the ground the the shielding.</p>

<p>A di box is also a good thing to try I guess... but it's odd that your boards completely freezes. I mean I had lot's of problems with unwanted noise on multi axolti board + preamp + midi controller applications. The thing that solve this for me was seperating the grounds of the power supplies with this baby <a href="https://www.ebay.de/i/283061974099?chn=ps" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.ebay.de/i/283061974099?chn=ps</a>. This has the advantage that I can run the whole setup with 12v coming from a battery wich makes the system even more independent of external noise.</p>

I never felt it was necessary because I never had noise or interference. Actually they're pretty brutally screwed to the bottom of a plastic box and all the cables always connected coming out from a hole... so it could also be the right time to get a hammond aluminum box and make a more refined job.<br>Even so my (poor) understanding is that this kind of shielding is good against RMI, and this should not be case, because it never happens when I play with headphones disconnected from the amps. I was thinking more of something like a DI box with ground lifted between last board and amp, but I'm shooting in the darkness as I don't know what I'm talking about really..</p>

              <p>Hi community!<br>I've had a (rarely) recurring issue with my axoloti live set-up during my otherwise super happy years of giggin' with it, and I think it's just about time to address it.<br>Basically, one or more of the axolotis in my 3/4 axos setup sometimes freeze during performance, and I'm pretty sure it's related to current instabilty in the amplifiers they're connected to. The axos are powered via a separate 12v battery, and the amps are 2 high quality AER acoustic amps (so change the amps is not an option <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> ), but the thing happens when the washing machine starts (at home, not too bad) or coffee machine (during pub concerts, rare but embarrassing to say the least).  I'm fairly ignorant in electronics so I'm asking for help!! What could I do to reduce such unpleasant events?</p>
