    <title>What possibilities axoloti offers me if I use it with an arduino</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/what-possibilities-axoloti-offers-me-if-i-use-it-with-an-arduino/4651</link>
    <description>Hello, I&#39;m new here, and before dedicating hours to this I would like to know what limitations I have if I want to integrate a midi controller made with arduino.

software ...

is it possible to transmit data by tx and rx?
axoloti sends data such as, midi cc, name of parameters, values, etc, for these ports.
any example from the axoloti part to send this information through these ports?

is the arduino midi library compatible to collect this data?

axoloti accepts MIDI messages: NRPN, 14bits, relative?

Hardware....

can the same encoder set to &quot;gpio&quot; move different parameters, as needed or is it condemned to a single parameter?
some example?</description>

              <p>Connecting an encoder / potentiometer to Axoloti can give you many many options for adjustments, but going into example would not do it justice, as there are so many options, and every ones needs are often very different. And to add to all that, if you don't find exactly what you are looking for, you can always tweak the code in the object where required.<br><img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/grinning.png?v=5" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:"></p>

<p>I have seen that there are only two shipping objects per tx (clock and note) to which object it refers.</p>

<p>thank you I have seen a couple of objects of this type I will investigate</p>

<p>sorry my english is very bad I try again</p>

<p>with an encoder connected to the axoloti board is it possible to use it to handle different parameters?<br>some example</p>
