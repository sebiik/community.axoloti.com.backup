    <title>Patch crashes when wave/play finds file on SD card, doesn&#39;t if it doesn&#39;t</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/patch-crashes-when-wave-play-finds-file-on-sd-card-doesnt-if-it-doesnt/300</link>
    <description>Strange thing: I&#39;m trying to use wave/play, and send it filenames from string/indexed.
While building, all seemed good, although I had no sound.
I then discovered I made a mistake in the file name (the files are in a subdirectory, and I forgot to add that).
So I fixed that, so play/wave should now find the files correctly.
However, now the patch crashes Axoloti (disconnect).
If I change the filename to something non-existing, the patch works again (though without sample playback obviously)
Is there an explanation and possibly a way to prevent this from happening?</description>

              <p>I can play wavefiles here. BUT If I change the sample I have to reconnect the Micro USB cable to the Axoloti almost everytime. Or If I change some things in the patch this also happens very often. </p>

<p>Also if you have 2 waveplayers in the same patch, with same file loaded the patch will not compile at all.</p>

<p>I checked the info from Johannes about SD-cards and he said in some cases class4 performed well so I got one of those. Anyway, it works but there a few things to be aware of. To start with I  thought it didn't work because it didnt compile the patches as it should. But disconnecting and reconnecting Micro USB cable does help, but it has to be done almost everytime you compile a patch. </p>

              <p>i've spent the weekend building an sdcard based instrument so I can help test the issue. I have everything working as intended. Do you mind sharing the patch? In my instrument I am not using the wave/play indexed object but I have tried the regular wave/play object. In the end I used the table/ objects to do what I need though.</p>
