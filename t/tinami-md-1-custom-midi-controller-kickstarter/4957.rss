    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/tinami-md-1-custom-midi-controller-kickstarter/4957</link>
    <description>Tinami MD-1 Custom Midi Controller released on Kickstarter.

This looks like an interesting concept if you want a (midi) controller that you can customise without having to solder 

200 or 250 euro, depending if you want faders or not.
thats not cheap, as you could build cheaper,  but being able to reconfigure easily its quite a bonus, and having the software makes it easier too.

If they do well could have an interesting future, perhaps different size cases, different components, which could swap things in an out of.

              <p>There are plenty of DIY boards out there form making MIDI controllers. The "battle DJ" market is full of them. Doepfer makes a couple too. All you add is Pots, Switches FSR's or whatever and they spit out MIDI CC commands. The only differences between the different models out there are the number of controls you can connect to them, and how you assign them to the MIDI CC numbers you want. Basic soldering skills to connect things up and mechanical skills or a free copy of Front Panel Express to make the cabinet to put it in.</p>

<p>yes, this is as I said in the OP...<br>it not hard, the hardware is quite easy , but you still need to prep a case, <br>also I think what is often overlooked is the effort required in the programming it up...<br>sure, its fairly trivial to just route the midi thru, but if you want to allow on the fly customisation, with a little app or web interface, that takes time, and also you need to ensure you have persistent storage for presets.</p>

<p>so depends what you have time for really.</p>

<p>ive built some interfaces for both bela and axoloti, but sometimes I just want to have something that works, so I can get on with other projects, or even make some music <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> </p>

<hr>

<p>talking of diy, to show im not against <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>I've a little tip, for Europeans - if you want a nice little box for your projects, I quite like the koma field kit, which koma sometimes sell<br><a href="https://koma-elektronik.com/?product=field-kit-box-b-stock" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://koma-elektronik.com/?product=field-kit-box-b-stock</a></p>

<p>18 euro is not cheap, but its nicely finished, 7 euros shipping, so better if your order more than one or something else from koma..<br>(ive now got a few, some from this b-stock, but also a couple from the field kits which ive moved into the rack)</p>

              <p>Building a midi controller with Arduino I think is quite easy and cheap, just time consuming, but this way you can make it they way you want and your not limited to 16 options only. But I am only talking momentary switches and pots, if you want lights and feedback, you can do it, but not quite as easy.<br>The reason why I am saying this, is because I was thinking of making a large Midi controller with 32 pots and 32 switches. I have a lot of bits and pieces already I can use, just get some pots and switches in bulk of ebay for the rest. Was also thinking of using a 8 4051 analogue multiplexers due to the large volume of pots and switches. Maybe I could do a how to video in the process for the Axo community... Hmmm !<br>I would have to purchase 4 of these custom midi controllers to achieve the same outcome.<br><img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/grin.png?v=5" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>

              <p>yeah its basically a 4x4 grid of components - whats interesting is you can switch the components.<br>(see the section  "Hackable Hardware", and you'll see how they are socketed )</p>

<p>Ive an open question though about how this would work with the faders as they take up 2 slots, and current images shows a different faceplate... but perhaps this is related to the 'customisable skins' they mention on the pledge (but not in any of the description) </p>

<p>we'll see, im sure they will answer my questions, and things will become clearer as the campaign develops.</p>

              <p>not bad. <br>i would like to try fader version, if someday Novation Remote Zero's disappear from ebay )) <br>16 presets is too tight, but Axoloti is the workaround. </p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> what i understood later is that the form factor is always the same, but one can choose the layout before buildind the unit. <br>very cool.</p>
