        <p>So we are starting to get some experience of users installing Axoloti, this thread will detail some common issues and suggestions if you have issue.<br>(note: Im not going to include,  pre-release/prototype boards - only production boards with 1.0 firmware)</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Read the relevant installation guide.</strong><br>I know, Im guilty of not reading installation/user guides -  but Axoloti is a little different it <strong>IS</strong> worth it. It will get you up and running faster, and if your turning to this thread, because you have an issue... go back and check the guide <img src="../../images/emoji/emoji_one/smilea4f0.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile"> <br>Im continually updating the installation guides to ensure they are correct, Ive also verified them on clean machines for all platforms. <br>If you find a mistake in the user guide, let me know and I will correct it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Download and Install the axoloti runtime</strong><br>This  is the #1 mistake (it is covered in the installation guides) <br>You just download and install the Axoloti App and your done, right? <br><strong>Wrong!</strong>  - Axoloti needs the runtime files, which are a separate install.<br>(I know we want a one click install too... but we have technical reasons for requiring axoloti_runtime to be installed separately)<br>If when you start the application you get the message (in the console)<br><code> Runtime directory is invalid:C:\Program Files (x86)\axoloti_runtime, is the runtime installed? correctly?</code><br>(directory is different on each platform, check installation guide for details).<br>This means that the runtime has not been found in the location expected, so please refer to the relevant installation guide and ensure it is placed where it should be.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Plugging in Axoloti via USB #1</strong><br>If Axoloti is not detected, try another USB port on the computer.<br>yes, this can be a problem... on an early iMac I have, on one of the USB ports Axoloti is not seen... and I know the USB port works (at least for some devices). Ive not worked out why yet, could be internal hub conflict/power requirements, but demonstrates the need to try other USB ports!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Plugging in Axoloti via USB #2</strong><br>We don't have any reports of issues with Axoloti compatibility, but normal support advice.<br>If Axoloti is not being detected, or is acting unexpectedly... then please try plugging in Axoloti directly into the PC/Mac without using a USB hub, and remove all other USB devices.  (except keyboard and mouse <img src="../../images/emoji/emoji_one/smilea4f0.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile"> ). If it starts working then introduce one device/hub at a time, to find the 'culprit'<br>Its very unlikely to be the cause BUT its best to eliminate this as a possibility...<br>Of course, still report the issue in the <a href="../../c/helpdesk.html">Helpdesk</a> and let us know that you have tried this, and any device that seems to be causing a conflict.  (we may or may not be able to do something to fix, but its valuable information for all users)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>USB Cables</strong><br>Faulty USB cables are not uncommon, so if Axoloti appears not to connect try another cable first!<br>Also, take care... <strong>many Micro USB cables are power only, no data!</strong> so cannot be used to connect Axoloti to your PC/Mac.  (i.e. you will see Axoloti board has power, but you cannot connect to it)<br>This is because many phones use microUSB as a charging connection only, and its becoming increasingly common since the EU voted to force phone manufactures to use microUSB charging from 2016!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Windows 7, XP, Vista  only</strong><br>May not have the necessary windows drivers installed or available via Windows Update, if when you connect the Axoloti Core it cannot find the drivers download here is a link to where you can download them.<br>(note: try first, its quite possible you will already have the WinUSB driver installed for other products etc, its a common driver)</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote><p>Apparently Windows Update does not provide the driver on XP, Vista and Windows 7. Use winusbcompat.zip, which I added here: <a href="https://github.com/axoloti/axoloti/releases" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="https://github.com/axoloti/axoloti/releases" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/axoloti/axoloti/releases</a> Extract, and point windows to the extracted location when it asks for a driver after plugging in.   Windows 8 and later do not need it.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>thats its, other than that it seems the majority have no issues installing and getting going.<br>of course, if you do encounter issues please let us know, and then we can try to improve the installation process, or let new users know of things to be aware of.</p>
