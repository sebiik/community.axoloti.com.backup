    <title>Broken axoloti :(</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/broken-axoloti/6657</link>
    <description>hi,
ive ordered my axoloti several years ago and never had much time to use i fully.
now would be the time but it&#39;s not connecting any more neither showing any sign of life.
changed the usb cables and tried several dc adapters.. (not the stomp box style, center was positive)
tbh it was not in a shielded bag, but still stored safely in a box without much electrostatics,
at least thats what i think..

is there someone i could sent it to to have a look at it ?</description>

              <p>I think you need to ask <a class="mention" href="/u/johannes">@johannes</a>, he is the developer, if there is anything that can be done.</p>

<p>You might have to write him a PM or get his email in some way, as he is not so often active in the forum. I am not sure what his email is. I am sure some one else have it or maybe it's on the the webside?</p>

<p>I hope you get it sorted out <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
