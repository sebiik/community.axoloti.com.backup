    <title>2 new AXOLOTI are not working</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/2-new-axoloti-are-not-working/3420</link>
    <description>Hi! I&#39;ve ordered 2 boards during kickstarter campaign, but tried them only now. Both boards are not working: one is not reacting to the power (both USB or external, no LEDs blinking). 

Second board always ask for firmware update but never connects after update and ask for update again. 

I have 3rd board that is working fine. What should I do?</description>

              <p>sorry to hear that, not heard of many DOA axolotis, to have two is really unlucky.</p>

<p>the one that is asking constantly for firmware updates, you should try to do the manual firmware (rescue) update, details are in the user-guide section.. its sounds like the normal firmware update is not actually successfully doing the update. I've had that before and the rescue mode fixed it.</p>

<p>generally, you need to PM <a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@Johannes</a> to discuss , click on this link to see his profile, and use message. (ive raised your user to next level, so messaging is now available)</p>

<p>provide him with as many details as possible, KS email, pictures of boards, details of what you've tried so far e.g. different usb cables.</p>

<p>good luck, hope you get it fixed asap.</p>
