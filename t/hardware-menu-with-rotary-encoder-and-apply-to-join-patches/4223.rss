    <title>Hardware menu with rotary encoder and ‘apply’ to ‘join’ patches?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/hardware-menu-with-rotary-encoder-and-apply-to-join-patches/4223</link>
    <description>This may be covered already and if so, apologies.
I just had this crazy idea of scrolling thru a display of pre-built patches, selecting say a drum patch, hitting the ‘apply’ button, scrolling to a synth patch, ‘apply’, etc. I still haven’t coded in axoloti to make objects but have some programming experience. Is this even possible?</description>

              <p>Thank you for your informative reply Mark...  this was something that just happened to come into my thoughts. I will investigate the dynamic patching threads further. Time for another axo!  Or two... <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

              <p>if i understand you correctly... then the answer is no <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> </p>

<p>what i essentially read as your question is can you dynamically patch on the axoloti... say without a computer.</p>

<p>the reason this is not possible, is because axoloti has precompiled patches, which are compiler on your <strong>host computer</strong> , it has no compiler (its not powerful enough to compile) </p>

<p>it also only has the ability (currently) to load complete compiled patches (thats how patch banks work)</p>

<p>one way this could kind of work, is if you had patch 'parts' precompiled , and some how overlaid and connected this... but this would require quite a bit of firmware work- this has been discussed before ... I think probably under the topic of 'dynamic patching' (or something similar) </p>

<p>anyway, so simple answer is no....</p>

<p>(of course , you can 'cheat' by compiling lots of things into one patch , and just disabling them and possibly having mux's to switch routing... but that only works to a limited code size)</p>
