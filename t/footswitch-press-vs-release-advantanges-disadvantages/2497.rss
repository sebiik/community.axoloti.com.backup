    <description>I hope the subject isn&#39;t to ambiguous !!

I have wired up 8 momentary foot switches, and I want to be able to patch them in as both momentary and toggle. Momentary is pretty straight forward, but toggle raises the conundrum of either the foot press v&#39;s foot release initiating the object in the patch. With a lot of basic guitar effect pedals, they foot press, with the odd one being designed with the foot release, some multi effects consoles can vary and I have seen some that offer both. I guess I could set it up with both as well, but not sure how I would keep track of which switch is what. So for now, I am thinking only the foot release.

Does anyone have any recommendations or thoughts to consider about the benefits of one over the other especially considering the Axoloti environment. :relaxed:

              <p>Just my 2 cents, but seems like a no brainer.<br>Why would you want to wait for release to initiate the action? <br>That will feel wrong and is useless if the action is time sensitive. </p>

<p>The only reason you'd wait for the release is if you had a second function tied to the same switch and operated by holding the switch down for a certain period ( I'm familiar with the terms 'shortpress' and 'longpress' for this situation, but don't know if they are in common usage.)<br>...or if there's some deal where you might use more than one switch at a time.</p>

              <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/users/mrbim">@MrBim</a>,<br>You have made think I can set all switches up to be the same, that way no switch will be different from the other which I want to avoid, but as you state allows options to try both.</p>
