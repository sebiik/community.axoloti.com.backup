        <p>I got into writing a custom object last night. The way I did it was to copy one of the factory objects and edit it. Currently I'm still using 1.0.6 because in 1.0.8 I couldn't get changes made to objects done in the object editor to take effect. On the other hand some things cannot be edited in the object editor in 1.0.6 so I took to editing the raw XML source with a text editor some of the time. I ran into a couple of issues though:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When Axoloti complains about the sha1 and uuid not being correct, does that also cause the object not to get loaded?</p></li>
<li><p>Even after updating and saving my XML source (using an external text editor), updating the sha1 and uuid, and doing Reload Objects, viewing the object in the patcher or clicking Live showed that the patcher was not aware of my new version. Does it cache the old one somehow? I seem to have gotten around it by deleting the object from my patch, inserting a completely different one, deleting that and then inserting the one I wanted again, but that was rather cumbersome and it seems like I'm missing something obvious.</p></li>
<li><p>If I changed the code of any object directly in the patcher's object editor, the changes took effect immediately. Do I still need to Save the object for the changes to be permanent?</p></li>
</ul>

        <p>yes, its a known issue of 1.0.8 - id avoid the editor in 1.0.8 personally.<br>I think I've solved all these issue in the development version which will become 1.0.9, <br>but theres a few other (non-related) issues that need fixing before 1.0.9 is released.</p>

<p>When I work on an object, in order to keep connections of my object when I want to reload it, I use "replace" item on contextual menu of my object, suppress and add the last letter of the name of my object (to refresh the list), and select the same object in the list. I think it's more efficient than delete object and re-add it, if inlets not change, of course.</p>
