    <title>Xpatch to editor-patch converter?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/xpatch-to-editor-patch-converter/7088</link>
    <description>While putting the finishing touches to a patch and saving it, the axoloti editor crashed..
I was able to save the xpatch file and all other files saved along when going live, but the axp file was severely corrupted (only about 5 lines of code left)..
Is there any way to &quot;auto&quot; convert this back into a usable patch-file?
Or is my only option having to scroll through the file, searching for the codes of the custom written modules?</description>
