    <title>I can&#39;t get rid of hardware button action [SOLVED]</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/i-cant-get-rid-of-hardware-button-action-solved/3142</link>
    <description>Hello all, as I said in the previous thread (when I stupidly broken the firmware upload) I have this hardware button connected to PB9 and I haven&#39;t been able to unlink it from changing the patch to the start patch on the SD card or the flash patch in case the SD card is not present. 

As far as I can tell I have no controller patch and in the current patch I send to the board there&#39;s no use of gpio/in/digital PB9, or if present, for example connected to a disp/bool, it doesn&#39;t do that and continue to change the patch and thus disconnects the editor, where I see

Control transfer failed: -4
Ping: WaitSync Timeout, disconnecting now
Disconnect request

so, my question is: is there a possibility that with my weak soldering skills I have connected it in a way that does what it does? I think it&#39;s very unlikely. So, it must be something software, but I can&#39;t understand for the life of me what is happening....

Can you help me?
Is there a way to completely reset any input function?

Thanks in advance</description>

<p>Yes indeed it was just a short between PB9 and the adiacent gnd... I'm very new to soldering... Now I cut the very small solder short with a blade and everything works as expected. Thank you very much for helping me</p>

<p>Yes<br></p>

<p>No I'm not sure the board it's not crashing, what happens is that with the sdcard it goes to start.bin and without it goes on the flash patch. I guess it's what it would do if crashing... So maybe it's crashing. It's possible to crash it with something (badly) soldered?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
