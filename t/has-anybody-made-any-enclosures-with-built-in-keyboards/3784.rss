    <title>Has anybody made any enclosures with built-in keyboards?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/has-anybody-made-any-enclosures-with-built-in-keyboards/3784</link>
    <description>I think it&#39;d be very cool to blur the line between &quot;synthesizer&quot; and &quot;instrument&quot; by encasing the Axoloti core into a MIDI controller. Has anybody tried it before? Are there any controllers with &quot;extra room&quot;, or would it be easier to attach an enclosure on to the side of an existing controller?</description>

              <p>There was enough space inside, but I didn't end up putting it inside.  I made a reverb and delay effects box instead, as the midi keyboard is sending wacky cc data by itself.    I may still do it some time in the future.</p>

    I opened my Oxygen 49 Mk III keyboard today to look at how much space is available inside, and found that there is the perfect space to mount the Axoloti inside.  As a result  I went through the process of creating a subpatch that will allow for easy connection of sliders, dials and buttons to future patches.  The added bonus is that the keyboard is class compliant which leaves all of the IO on the Axoloti for future expansion. Below is the subpatch file.  Things to note include buttons 1-8 latcâ€¦

    It's a bit crude at the moment - But I've got a decent white powder coated backplane on it's way from Front Panel Express. 

Powered directly from the Code's DC input (9V 1A DC wall wart), along with internal MIDI I/O routing, which will be bypassed with an external double pole toggle switch. 

It's a great all-in-one solution with more than enough real-time control :wink:
