    <description>Fellowship of Axo - 1 of 2
===

**Submission date: open ended, feel free to add more seeds at any time**

The &quot;Fellowship of Axo&quot; challenge centres on collaboration, exploring with others.
Part one is about providing seeds of inspiration to other musicians, which they can plant and grow to fruition in [part two](https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/fellowship-of-axo-reaping-the-fruits).

For this challenge, your task is to provide a seed of inspiration, something that can be used (and abused) in part two. To encourage participation, I&#39;ll keep it vague, but my ideas are

- an audio source  : a sound, part of a track, a melody 
- a patch :   an instrument, a sequencer

the seed can be as simple or as complex as you like, sometimes, a tiny snippet of audio is all that&#39;s needed to take us off into a new direction.

In  [Part Two (reaping the fruits)](https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/fellowship-of-axo-reaping-the-fruits) musicians can take one or more seeds, and use to create a piece. they will be free to use it in anyway they see fit, either in part or in full, recognisable or not ;)

When creating the seed,  we are all restricted in time, so make it simple for your fellows, if your submitting a patch, consider an audio snippet too - perhaps your fellow might choose to use just the audio.

Restrictions
---
- Axoloti must be a major part the seed creation
- Seed must not include any copyrighted material 
- To use the seed (in part 2) must not require anything other than Axoloti

you can use any tools you wish alongside axoloti
e.g. its fine to use a synth, and use Axoloti as an FX (if the FX is the major part of the submission), or flipped around use Axoloti as the sound generator and use external effects.
again, samples ( in accordance with copyright) , synthesis, fx -  all is game for creation.

Submission
---

demonstration - either video or soundcloud link, demonstrating what your offering as a seed. embed a link here, the name of the game here, is make it simple for the fellowship to get a glimpse of the potential of your seed.

&#39;The Seed&#39;  - depending upon what your seeding, you can provide an audio file, or patch or both.

Audio File - which can be used directly as the seed for part two.
post link here - WAV format, hosted on a site that does not require registration.  (Id recommend dropbox, via a shared link) , try to keep the size &#39;reasonable&#39;... I personally don&#39;t want to be downloading GBs of samples :) 

Patch - you can post here and/or you can upload to community library and provide details here

lets get sowing .... the more seeds we sow, the more fruit we will reap.

**note:** it looks like everyone is busy, so Ive decided to make this an &#39;open ended&#39; challenge, with no end date, so please feel free to add new seeds at any time... and hopefully someone will pick it up to develop it.</description>

              <p>Good idea for a challenge and good looking stuff so far. My Axo is currently undergoing a somewhat painful re-homing, with the inevitable waits for random bits and piece from China <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/sob.png?v=3" title=":sob:" class="emoji" alt=":sob:"> . Hopefully I'll have it up and running soon to get a bit more stuck in with these.</p>

<p>to this end, you can continue to add seeds here, and at any time, pick up a seed from here, and then post what you make of it in the <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/fellowship-of-axo-reaping-the-fruits">reaping the fruits</a> thread.</p>

              <p>another seed... if you have an axoloti control <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>patch has the controls describe in it as comments<br>basically, its simple looping like device device, where the pots control start/length and speed.<br>the buttons are <br>record on/off<br>overdub for record on/off (record feedback)<br>record source, oscillator or audio int.</p>

<p>the joystick, temporarily nudges buffer, and pitch/speed.</p>

<p>the idea is simple record something (the default oscillator is fun to get started) then used the pots, to find a part you like, perhap then active overdub and record.. rinse and repeat.</p>

<p>tip: if the length is short, then you use slow playback, longer length.<br>tip: the trick to finding 'sweet spots' is using the big pots, for find tuning.<br>tip: watch master gain level, when initially setting up, it can get loud with feedback/resonance.<br>(I've already reduce headphone level in audio setup for what i found comfortable, but headphones differ)<br>tip: interesting audio in, can lead to interesting audio out <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Update:<br>Ive created 5 samples using this, which you can use independently of this patch.<br>they are all wav files - i decided to leave as wav's as its likely you'd want to edit/chop them up etc before transferring to axoloti.<br>you can download from dropbox <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/60j0yv9rk3vreaw/sampleseeds.zip?dl=0">here</a></p>

<p>I can't propose anything too fancy, so I've shared 3 patches that may be inspiring to some:</p>

<p>The first is a "bird, fire and wind" sound effect patch : <strong>Library/community/mtyas/seeds/forest</strong></p>

<p>The second is a "Synth Orchestra" midi playable patch (4 voices poly) : <strong>Library/community/mtyas/seeds/synorch</strong></p>

<p>and the 3rd one is a "drunk prog rock band simulator" patch : <strong>Library/community/mtyas/seeds/13ate</strong><br>This one needs samples for the drums, so I've uploaded some simple samples I made on github : <a href="https://github.com/axoloti/axoloti-contrib/tree/1.0.12/patches/mtyas/seeds/samples">https://github.com/axoloti/axoloti-contrib/tree/1.0.12/patches/mtyas/seeds/samples</a> but you can use your own if you want</p>

<p>its a new set of objects called <strong>polyseq</strong>, which you will now find in the community library.</p>

<p><strong>tb/seq/polyseq</strong>  - its a polyphonic, polyrhythmic, polymetric step sequencer <br>thats harder to say, than use, fortunately....</p>

<p>simply, it allows you to drive multiple tracks (polyphonic) each have a different length (polymetric), and each having a different clock division (polyrhythms)</p>

<p>you will find a help patch attached to the objects, which demonstrates usage, and could be easily adapted for your own use.</p>

<p>Ive included a couple of 'simple' objects which cover probably the main case, which is for driving note/percussion type tracks (with 5 attributes) , but you'll see the low-level read/write objects allow other control interfaces, and allow for any number of attributes per step.  </p>
