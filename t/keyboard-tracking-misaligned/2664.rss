    <title>Keyboard tracking misaligned?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/keyboard-tracking-misaligned/2664</link>
    <description>Ok not sure where this should go and how to best put this is wording:

I&#39;ve set up a simple patch with the main oscillator tuned to C2/65.41Hz however when I send a C2 note over midi I actually hear an D#2/77.78Hz

What&#39;s going on here?
I thought something was off for a while, but I just played by ear mostly, but recently when I was trying to make some melodic combinations with other instruments I got annoyed and I realized the Axoloti is tuned upwards somehow.

Really no idea what I&#39;m doing wrong here ..</description>

<p>I now tuned the oscillators to E2/E3/B5 and it's the result I actually intended <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>can you post the patch, it would be a  little clearer to me then the confusion...<br>Im surprised any example, would use the oscillator, tuned to anything other than 0 or octaves... i guess 5ths is ok as well if you want to have the old keyboard auto chords <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>Since I initially got these oscillator-settings from the 'getting started' guide I hope <a class="mention" href="/users/janvantomme">@janvantomme</a> will make a revision where this tuning is explained a bit better (with maybe also examples that actually track the keyboard).</p>

<p>Cheers and thnx.</p>

<blockquote><p>So 'C2' in the osscillator setting basically is played when 'E4' is received over midi?</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>thats not the way to view it...<br>view it as, tuning the oscillator to C4, is detuning it by -4 semi tones  (to C2, its -28 semis) , so anything you play on the oscillators is now detuned -4  semis. (its because pitch 0 is E, not C) </p>

<p>musically it does make sense, imagine a guitar, its top string is tuned to E... , so at fret 8 it play C.<br>now if you tune the top string to C, and play at fret 8, you wont get C <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>its the same... the oscillators are tuned to E as a reference, not C <br>it makes no difference if its C , E or something else (its E, for the midi reasons I posted above) </p>

<p>this is probably why most synths dont expose what the oscillator is 'tuned' to, thats internal, they just given you transposition... coarse and fine usually, i guess this is where us keyboard players, get this assumption  C = 0 <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Hmm, this is indeed quite counter intuitive.</p>

<p>I would've expected hearing a C when playing a C, but this needs a little puzzling to set my oscillators to something that makes sense sonically <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>odd, thats not right.. if you tune the oscillator to C2, and you play C2, you should get G# (not D#) <br>this is what I (correctly) get when testing with a sine oscillator...<br>if your not getting G# can you post your patch.</p>

<p>anyway, the reason if you tune to C2, and play C2 , you dont get C2, is oscillators are tuned to E, </p>

<p>or put another way 0 in pitch  is E4, it actually best (I find) not to view  oscillators pitch as note numbers, and instead view as transposition (i.e. integers) , so when you tune an oscillator to C4, you'll see its a -4 semitone transpose , so sending in C, will be transposed by -4 semis , so G#</p>

<p>why is zero not C, good question... one i 'argued' with Johannes when I first got my axoloti...<br>unfortunately its down to midi... its a 127 steps, 0 midi = C-1 , 127 = G9 , this then translates to the same range in axoloti of -64 to +63, unfortunately that means 0 lands at E4.<br>( I think, but not sure, that Johannes, said its similar on the nord modular, but i may be wrong on that)</p>

<p>anyway, I found it counter intuitive initially, until I stopped looking at the note display on the oscillator and instead looked a the integer on the dial <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
