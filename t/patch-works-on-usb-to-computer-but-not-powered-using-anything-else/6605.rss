    <title>Patch works on USB to computer but not powered using anything else</title>

    <description>Hello!
I have this patch consiting of a drum-machine that plays samples and also sends MIDI notes out through the DIN jack.
Some of the MIDI notes needs to be delayed so I have put lots of delayed pulses everywhere in order for things to sync up properly.

&lt;a class=&quot;attachment&quot; href=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e37d0debfb335802ece87ba4f28b0b7c48a9809f.axp&quot;&gt;trum_sel_stringmux.axp&lt;/a&gt; (41.1 KB)


Running this patch while connected via USB to a computer, say desktop PC or macbook pro, works fine.
However, when running the Axoloti poweder by pretty much ANYTHING else it works for a brief second then freezes into a steady tone.

I&#39;ve read some posts regarding this that maybe has to do with order of execution, or that it plays the samples before they are actually fully read. 
The SRAM is pushed  to the limits but it works while connected to PC so I&#39;m not sure how to solve it while not connected to PC ;) 

Thankful for any help!</description>

              <p>Axoloti doesn't like to send midi and not have a device receiving that midi. From my experience this always crashes a patch.</p>

<p>The patch you posted sends out midi to the device port. When axoloti is not to a host that means you will send midi to no device --&gt; patch will be crashing.</p>

              <p>if you are very low on sram things get fishy on axoloti. all kind of weird things can happen then. i would try to simplify some part of your patch in order to free up some sram and see if it then works in standalone mode. if it does your problem is probably sram related, if not, you'll have to dig deeper.</p>
