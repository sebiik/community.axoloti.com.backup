    <title>Whenever I add &quot;gpio/out/pwm t3&quot; other pinouts stop working</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/whenever-i-add-gpio-out-pwm-t3-other-pinouts-stop-working/7550</link>
    <description>So, yeah, I&#39;m trying to add a LED to keep in time with an LFO, and I&#39;ve got the LED connected to a PWM pin on the axo board (PB1). I&#39;ve tried several times now to add the object gpio/out/pwm t3. It does work and the LED does light up and keep up with the speed of the LFO, but whenever I do add the object to my patch, other previously working pinouts stop working, namely PB0 and PA7. Even if I don&#39;t connect the object to anything, so it&#39;s just floating around freely within my patch, these other inlets just don&#39;t do anything anymore. They were previously connected to 10K pots. WHAT!? I assume it&#39;s because these pinouts are outlets inside the object, but how do I use only the PB1 pinout without the rest of the object canceling out my original plans for PB0 and PA7? HALP

edit. I figured it out. Don&#39;t know how to delete thread. I just removed the outlets I didn&#39;t need from K-rate and Init-code. My first time messing with the code. Very spooky.</description>
