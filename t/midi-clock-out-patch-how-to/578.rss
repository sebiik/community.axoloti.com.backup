    <title>Midi clock out patch how to</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/midi-clock-out-patch-how-to/578</link>
    <description>Hi there,

this is my first post, although I got the Axoloti since the end of kickstarter :smile:
Basically what I wanted is to realize a midi clock output to start and synchronize some of my other hardware gear, and because I am into hardware electroncis, I am of course interested in the whole axoloti board.

But sadly, ok to admit I only tried for less than half an hour, to establish a midi clock out, but it didnt work, I only had one patch in my file, the midi clock out, do I need a start? a trigger a out? I put the patch on din ( is that correct? ) i want the midi port out of course to shoot out the midi clock so start all my &quot;slaves&quot; playing music.

So I hoped any of you have realized a midi clock out and can help me out here a little.

Ah and one more error appeared, I will copy and paste it later at home, it says USB is connected but i cannot go live, I fear a little bit that something is broken, but will try to flash the firmware again later, could all be one problem or 2 seperated ones, I will find out soon.

And just for interest I want to have the korg esx 1 on the midiclock, and maybe later some more midi samplers sp 404.

Thanks for your help.</description>

<p>you should do ... do you see the midi device in the device manager? (I assume your using windows).<br>when axoloti is installed, it exposes to devices over USB, the midi device and the bulk device. (the later being used to communicate with the UI) .. so on PC/Mac/Linux axoloti looks like a class compliant USB midi device.</p>

<p>if thats not happening, probably best to create a new post in the helpdesk, with details about your setup, what is working and whats not. in particular a screenshot of the usb device entries in device manager would be useful.<br>so... you've never been able to send midi from the PC to axoloti, or did you do it via the USB device listed in the preferences in the old version of axoloti?</p>

              <p>No, when a device is plugged into the  axolotis usb <strong>host</strong> port, then it can expose 4 ports to the axoloti. <br>(i can do more, but i thought 4 would be enough, as id only see 2 so far on a usb to midi din adapter i have)</p>

<p>theoretically, the axoloti firmware could be changed to expose more than 1 port to the PC, on the usb device.</p>

<p>but cant really see a use for it, its typically used when 16 channels are not enough.<br>(so in the converters example above, its because there are 2 physical din which can act as in or out, and obviously  each can carry 16 midi channels)</p>

              <p>Thanks for promt answer.</p>

<p>Yes I did that demo device like 2 month ago, then had no time or lust to continue and now starting to get back on track again.</p>

<p>I am electric engineer so I can tell an usb connector from a Midi one amongst other maybe <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> more advanced stuff.</p>

<p>What confused me a bit is the DIN, has the input in it and I want the midiout, but your explanation was pretty clear so thanks again.<br>And I am aware that I am still at the beginning, so my questions are pretty basic, so I appreciate your effort of answering them anyway.</p>

<p>I hope I can experiment and use the axoloti from now on more frequently and keep you guys informed.</p>

<p>why trial and error? I thought its pretty clear, no?</p>

<p>din is the midi din output (check underside of board for in/out markings), <br>usb host is the usb host port,  the bigger one you plug usb devices into (i.e. axoloti is hosting the device)<br>usb device is the micro usb port, used when the axoloti is acting as a midi device. (which is does when connecting to a pc for example)</p>

<p>(host/device is standard terminology for usb) </p>

<p>Id recommend reading the user guide, it explains things like types (booleas, floats etc) ... also check out the tutorials and help patches. <br>patching is not difficult but obviously does require a bit of learning.... easier if you have used nord modular/reaktor/max/pd but its difficult.</p>

<p>to test the board id highly recommend you run a demo patch, so you have confidence everything is working.. again there is a step by step guide in the user guide.</p>

<p>The display objects are useful for debugging/testing, but are not needed for the patch to work.</p>

<p>the diplays you onlz put there to see the actual count, right?</p>

<p>So I dont wanna use USB out, since I use the USB only for programming and access to the axoloti pcb.</p>
