    <title>Making new objects - The basics</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/making-new-objects-the-basics/299</link>
    <description>Hello,

In order to be able to use Axoloti for what I intend to do I&#39;m going to need to make a new object.
I read somewhere that there is going to be an object editor in the future, but in the meantime we can use a text editor. 
The thing is I have been fooling around with it, and I can&#39;t make my new object appear in the objects window. Obviously I&#39;m doing something wrong (many things, I presume), but before I continue hitting my face against the window like a fly I would like to make sure my suckiness is in the code, and not in the procedure.
So my question is, as long as I write the code and save the file as &#39;whatever.axo&#39; in one of the objects folders, and then in Axoloti I go to File-reload objects, it should appear where I put it, right?

Oh and another question: What language are objects written in? I learnt c++ back in the day and I seem to be able to read the logic in the factory objects, but there are some things that I just don&#39;t recognize, and I would like to be able to know which ones are part of the object and which are part of the languaje and should be included.

Sorry about the newbie questions :blush:</description>

<p>This way I can assign a note to each one of the boards in our instrument. The assignation in the image is just an example, normally we use scales.<br>I think this object is not worth sharing because it is too specific in its function, but if anyone is interested just tell me <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley.png?v=0" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt="smiley"></p>

<p>is XML, and means unparsed character data. Without this, you'd need to write <code>&amp;</code> as <code>&amp;amp;</code> and <code>&lt;</code> as <code>&amp;lt;</code> etc.</p>

<p>To map midi notes to different pitches, you can use a table. Check demos/midi_fx-alternate_tuning.axp , this shows how to use a one table for microtonal (de)tuning. <br>Alternatively, the "harmony/note quantizer" object may be of interest.</p>

              <p>Heyy thanks, I'll try that <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/sunny.png?v=0" title=":sunny:" class="emoji" alt="sunny"> .</p>

<p>The things I don't recognize are, for example, this: <code>&lt;code.declaration&gt;&lt;![CDATA[    int32_t _scaleVal;</code><br>I don't know what that CDATA does, and if I should include that in my object.</p>

<p>What I'm aiming for is something like the "Scale" midi effect on ableton.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS0ve1PGoME&amp;t=3m40s" rel="nofollow">We have made this DIY midi version of an ancient basque instrument</a>, and it always sends the same 12 notes: 60-71. Right now we use the scale midi effect on ableton so we can assign any note we want to each board, and then we use Sylenth1 to generate the sound. I would like to get the computer out of the way and get Axoloti to be the core of the instrument (instead of Sylenth1). So I need to make an object that receives midi notes 60-71 and lets you choose what notes are going to come out of it. <br>For example, if you receive C1, change it to D#3, if you receive C#1, change it to F3, etc.<br>I guess I could use twelve midi/in/keyb zone touch (C1-C1, C#1-C#1...), and transpose each one separately, but I think if I make my own object for that I'd be saving some ram and cpu.</p>

<p>Thanks again <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile"> </p>

<p>If you copy an existing .axo file, replace id, uuid and sha with an unique (random) value.</p>

<p>Objects are defined in c++ without function headers, the headers are auto-generated depending on inlets, outlets and parameters.<br>What things do you not recognize?<br>___SMMLA, __SSAT, ___SMMUL etc. are intrinsic functions, they map to processor instructions.</p>

<p>And out of curiosity: what do aim to achieve?</p>
