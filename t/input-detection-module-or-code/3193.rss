    <title>Input detection - module or code?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/input-detection-module-or-code/3193</link>
    <description>Is there a simple way, in code or with modules to test if a patch cable is connected to an input?

There are plenty of situations with subpatches for example, when one might want to know if a user has a patch cable connected.

The prime example that I&#39;m struggling with tonight, is having a combined Noise and Sample-and-Hold module.  If there&#39;s no signal connected to the input the patcher should route the noise to the SnH input.  If there is a signal connected the patcher should use that.  I&#39;m not exactly sure how to test.  &quot;input !=0&quot; would route to noise if the input was quiet. There are several other incorrect tests my brain went through.

If there was a way to do it in code (C) I might take a basic module&#39;s code and hack together an &quot;is connected&quot; module.  If the input is connected to a patch cable send a high gate and pass the signal through. Otherwise basically do literally _nothing_.

Any smart ideas would be appreciated.  I feel this functionality could also be handy in other modules - certain code could take precedence in specific conditions.</description>
