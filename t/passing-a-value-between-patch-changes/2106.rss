    <title>Passing a value between patch changes</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/passing-a-value-between-patch-changes/2106</link>
    <description>Request: Am looking for the simplest way to pass a value between patches.
Reason: To keep track of the patch number position of last used patch.
Please note that I have looked through many threads regarding patch tables, etc,, and from what I require, I do not believe these will help my situation.
I will have a patch list patch I intend to list all of the patches stored on the SDCard, that will be select up and down by foot switches through a mux like setup. But also as the list is either increased or decreased, axo pinouts will be hardwired to the midi controllers preset switches. The controller has 99 presets to choose from, and each patch will be connected to the preset value. For example patch number 4 will connect to first preset 10, it will also be able to use more presets for the same patch so lets say patch 4 will also use preset 11, 12 as well. But for the sake of patch selection will only need to go to preset 10 to begin with.
Then once I select to load my choice, the correct patch will open, and CC values stored in presets 10, 11 and 12 will dump into the axo as default effect CC values to be applied. Example volume level, gain level etc..
The problem why I have raised this is because then when I want to change patch again, I want to be able to return to the main patch list patch, starting from the last used patch &quot;Patch 4&quot; with the correct Midi preset value &quot;Preset 10&quot; so I can then select from this position my next patch. As I have a display on the Midi controller, then I want to know that the correct Patch has been selected because it shows on the controller preset number example preset 10 means patch 4 has been selected.
I just need to find a way to carry for example one single value of 4 that will change depending on the last patch used, after using patch number 4 to the patch list patch to start again from patch position 4.

Any assistance you can provide about where I can store a value will be greatly appreciated. I have thought of maybe using a text file or data file of sorts, As you can imagine, the data is very small, I can&#39;t imagine I will need to store more than 50 patches on an SD card, so storing 1 to 50 somewhere and being able to access it is all I need.

Thanks..:slight_smile:</description>

              <p>That's a dirty trick I did, but the only way I could address this feature request without changing the firmware. The relevant changes to do it properly are already in development will break this code, while the <code>patch/bankindex</code> object be adapted to the firmware.</p>

              <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/users/thetechnobear">@thetechnobear</a>,<br>Apologies if explanation is unclear, I do struggle with trying to find the right terminology to use.</p>

<p>My reference to presets is the Midi controller I have, I will not be using Axo presets. My Midi controller is the Behringer BCN44, each preset will store 4 x Rotary controller values, and 8 push button values, so apologies if this has confused.</p>

<p>I have read up as much as I can find about the patch/bankindex object, and if I am understanding it correctly, it loads value index i, what I require is when I return to my main patchlist patch, that I am able to extract the last selected value of index i and assign it to a variable that I can work with in further code. I expect I will need to modify the patchindex object, but as this is linked to the patch bank, I am somewhat clueless as to where to start. That's why I asked thinking it might be easier to just store one value that is an index to a patch somewhere.</p>

<p>I hope the above helps explain my conundrum a little clearer.<br>Thanks <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/relaxed.png?v=2" title=":relaxed:" class="emoji" alt=":relaxed:"></p>

              <p>presets are stored per patch - as they are specific to that patch.<br>e.g. you cant load preset 4, into both patch 8 and 9... <br>(sorry, if Ive misunderstood this)</p>

<p>the new patch/bankindex  does what you want within a patch bank...<br>(there are examples of its use somewhere here on the forum, but id have to track them down... the topic was about how to change patches from gpio)</p>

<p>generally, in the future there is some need for being able to take data from one patch to another, but it will have to be controlled and limited, due to the fact that such memory would have to be 'reserved' for such use, and so unavailable for general patch use i.e. its becomes unavailabe for more general use.</p>

<p>anyway, i think the patch bank functionality does everything you need/have described</p>
