    <title>Ordered a second one</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/ordered-a-second-one/6269</link>
    <description>Apologies in advance. I only want to express my gratitude and out myself as a fan-boy.
I think the Axoloti is the best invention since sliced bread. Because a lot of expensive hardware devices are close to being great but often slightly miss the mark and you can&#39;t do anything about it.

Whereas the Axoloti is completely customizable and has such a great way of building patches. I love the combination of visual/graph based editing together with being able to write C++ code. I like the choice of C++ over adding some high-level language, I guess it&#39;s common sense because of the execution speed.

It let&#39;s me create way more complex sequencers, I can glue existing Midi devices by making it process midi data in interesting ways. It&#39;s simply more bang for the buck if you are willing put some some work into it. 

Thanks to all the providers of patches and objects, they are immensely useful.

At this point I am only using existing midi-controllers but I am looking forward to building my own.

By the way, are there any ready-made PCBs available for building a sequencer?
I am also looking for instructions on connecting/programming small screens (I got an 128x64 pixel OLED available for example)</description>

              <p>No need for apologies... Axoloti is as awesome as you say <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> <br>Johannes was working on creating a control unit :   <a href="http://www.axoloti.com/axoloti-control/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.axoloti.com/axoloti-control/</a><br>But there is no release date for it as it's not a priority. <br>I guess you could get an Axocontrol from music thing modular or a hohum pcb</p>

<p>regarding the OLED thing. check in the forum.  Tiar, Aka Smashed transistors has made some nice, easy and essential objects for it. <br>connecting the oled to the board is also pretty straightforward. <br>greetings.</p>
