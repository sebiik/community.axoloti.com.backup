    <title>S1 &amp; S2 switches having different functions for short and long press</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/s1-s2-switches-having-different-functions-for-short-and-long-press/6121</link>
    <description>Hi all, I just got my axoloti and exploring the possibilities to use it as a prototype platform.

I&#39;m planning a couple of initial patches to get go, but I do have a question: is it possible to program S1 and S2 to have different actions if short pressed or long pressed?

I&#39;d like to have them programmed short press to toggle parameters of my object, and long press to change patch from the sdcard...any help would be welcome, or if someone already did one of both of these things and I can see how to do it...

There&#39;s a lot to learn! :slight_smile:</description>

              <p>Wow thanks a lot, got now a full list of all factory and community objects so I can have a look, that switches problem seems solved brilliantly (and then some more!) by the buttonFunctions <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Now I only have to see how to have a mono normalised input so that it goes to mono if only left input is connected or stereo if both are..worst case scenario I can use the switches but would be cool to find a more 'automatic' solution <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

              <p>You can use the "until" counter object for that:</p>

<p>When you press the button, you start the counter.</p>

<p>and then you can use a "less than" or "greater than" object to set how long you want it to be hold before something happens.</p>

<p>For example:<br>If the "until" counter is less than 100000 samples, then toggle parameters.<br>If the counter is larger than 100000 samples then change patch.</p>
