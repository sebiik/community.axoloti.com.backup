    <title>Using just a few rotary encoders to control almost every parameter of axoloti?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/using-just-a-few-rotary-encoders-to-control-almost-every-parameter-of-axoloti/557</link>
    <description>hi all, right now people are using potentiometers to adjust parameters.

but since the axoloti has limited amount of analog inputs, and those pots consume power as well, i suggest we look into rotary encoders
like:
one to scroll trough parameters of a patch
one to control first param
one to control second param (if supported)
one to control third param (if supported)
one to control fourth param (if supported)

small example:
if the first encoder is 0: light up external led 1 for adjusting adsr_1 envelope (using the other encoders)
if the first encoder is 1: light up external led 2 for adjusting oscilator 1&amp;2 pitch/mix (using the other encoders)
if the first encoder is 2: light up external led 3 for adjusting other params (using the other encoders)
and so on.

and to go even fancier: perhaps make a serial based display driver? (like 2x16characters or 4x20characters)

if you still don&#39;t get what i mean, simply look at the Groovesizer TB2 (open source arduino due based synth), it uses the exact system i pretty much want right now for axoloti. :)
and if that isn&#39;t clear enough, have a look at this: http://community.axoloti.com/t/ableton-push-controlling-axoloti/248
but the only difference being having the controls embedded instead of using midi. (so no ableton push needed, since the price can be quite high for it)

for now, the major 2 questions are: is it possible and if so, how do we archieve this code/patching wise?</description>

              <p>A resistor DAC is pretty simple, you could actually do the same thing directly from Axoloti though it would use a lot of system resources. 320*200 is about a 25Mhz pixel clock, so at a rough guess that would be between 15-25% of available clock cycles.</p>

<p>I have an FPGA board that has a VGA chip and plug on it, I could use that even.</p>

<p>Got 2 Axo projects I want to get some work done on and upload some beta versions of then I will be working on adding controls, a display and various types of buffered I/O, will try a couple of different approaches to the display.</p>

<p>I'll keep you posted.</p>

This is why I chose this direction. On a side note, this setup also works on NTCS and PAL televisions with RCA Video inputs, so any screen like this you have can be recycled too, the wiring is mostly the same as VGA, with only some small differences. In fact I am looking at changing to a small PAL unit powered by a separate power supply unit.</p>

Then of course the Axo, I have a pined board with wires hard wired going to 3 different destinations, controls, arduino due, and a foot controller not shown that has an arduino nano.

<p>The 5 para's controlled within the axo on the left monitor are spread out over the 64 as you will see it selected on the right monitor, it also shows changing of the values, the numbers in green, and the pressing of the momentary action of the rotary switch which changes a red square to yellow on the VGA screen. You will also notice that some action has no change, this proves that unless there is a match between the selected value and the nominated value in the axo patch, there will be no change. You may also notice a few small bugs on the vga side to iron out.</p>

              <p>Hi All,<br>I know this thread has been doing the rounds for a while, connected directly to the Axo, I have found a way to use 2 rotary encoders to control every parameter, or at least those you want to control.<br>Basically it has one encoder to select the value of the parameter, this can be an unlimited number count of parameters to adjust. Then the parameter itself is given a number that connects to the selected value which can be adjusted and or the built in momentary switch (if it has one) when it is selected. The objects to support this can just be added further as more parameters for control are added etc... Works very well in the GUI environment.

<p>  tho I am having a weird issue when I want to send lots of cc's. </p>

<p>This for when I switch patch , which I am doing on the arduino side. </p>

<p>once I load my values in to an array, I am using a for loop to step thru the array and send each value to the axo one after the other. </p>

<p>I am using the same code to send each message as I am for when I turn a dial, but for some reason the axo isn't receiving it correctly. </p>

<p>Any suggestions as to why this might be?</p>

<p>note: as i mentioned, we don't currently support 14 bit velocity. <br>(also in that implementation, Id have thought it should be velocity &lt; 127 , not 256)</p>

<p>it would be trivial to add, but frankly, its really hard to strike a key with the same force every time, and so I found 14 bit velocity didn't anything even with hi-res controllers.<br>( I tested with an Eigenharp and Pianoteq which both support it)</p>

<p>of course, Im sure, concert trained pianists would strongly disagree, and say correctly, its insufficient skill <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=2" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>however, in contrast 14 bit CC/PB (and channel pressure though only defined in MPE) really can be felt and utilised, due to its continuously nature.</p>

<p>heres a list of the 'official' 14 bit CC messages: (as i said with 32 offset)<br><a href="https://www.midi.org/specifications/item/table-3-control-change-messages-data-bytes-2" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.midi.org/specifications/item/table-3-control-change-messages-data-bytes-2</a></p>

              <p>14bit protocol for CC,  are sent as 2 independent CC values, the default is the LSB is MSB CC+32.<br>e.g. for mod wheel , you send CC 1 (MSB) and CC 33. (LSB) <br>so for CC1 14 bit, 129 ,  send CC33 = 2, CC 1 = 1     (1*127+2)<br>(also, it is best to send the LSB before the MSB... to avoid 'bumps' on MSB boundaries.)</p>

<p>PB is always 14 bit, and is a 3 byte midi message.</p>

<p>so there is an overhead for 14 bits, and you are sending 2 bytes for each, CC, so 4 bytes, gets you 14 bits... (even worst over USB, which is 6 bytes!), hence the push for a proper HD midi spec <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=2" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
