    <title>Gpio/out/pwm t3 disables PA6 and PA7 as input</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/gpio-out-pwm-t3-disables-pa6-and-pa7-as-input/7151</link>
    <description>Hi,

I am trying to drive two LEDs with gpio/out/pwm t3 object using PB0 and PB1, but when I have object on my patch I cannot use the other pins that appears here (PA6 and PA7).

If I delete the object I recovery again PA6 an PA7.

Is the any object to use only PB0 and PB1 as output or can I customize gpio/out/pwm t3?

It is the first time that I am using GPIOs as output so it is possible I am missing something.

Thanks in advance</description>
