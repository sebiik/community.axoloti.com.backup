    <title>Probable issue with axoloti due to user&#39;s Windows permissions</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/probable-issue-with-axoloti-due-to-users-windows-permissions/128</link>
    <description>Hi - I successfully can connect the Axoloti board to the Axoloti app, but compiling patches and uploading them to the board does not seem possible. I suspect my user&#39;s permissions on this corporate windows PC so I will try to do it on a local admin account in a sec.

I suspect, based on past conversation, that the Axoloti Windows MSI tries to create a directory in the user&#39;s Documents folder but on my (strange) setup it is not possible - so that folder is missing. The missing Axoloti content in the documents folder is most likely key to my patch upload errors.

Just for extra info here is the full log after running the app and trying to &quot;go live&quot; with two tutorial patches:

Always a big bonus if i can leave out linux from the studio since I am on Ableton at the moment (am a bitwig tester but don't have a fully dedicated ubuntu machine for it since BW isn't "good enough" for me yet)</p>

              <p>If you have now flashed the released version of 1.0 to the Axoloti board, and have not previously connected it to your machine at home, it should just work... plug and play style.</p>

<p>the issue was do with how the VID/PID were reported by firmware prior to official 1.0 version, and how windows caches this in the registry... and can only be removed by some 'registry diving', which is not user friendly.</p>

<p>fortunately, zadig/libusb could cope with the pre 1.0 format* , winusb can't, so its less error prone for users to use this, rather than hacking the registry.</p>

<p>(*this was also the reason we didn't spot it, till just before the official 1.0 firmware was released... and I installed on a 'virgin' windows machine and then johannes could resolve the issue)</p>

              <p>Yep all good!</p>

<p>note: I also suspect the Axoloti will work perfectly on my main machine at home (which has the DFU drivers for STM board configured) since I will not need DFU for firmware flashing and the axo board has its own drivers. <br>I assume I will still have to reinstall the WinUSB driver for the Axoloti Bulk Interface, but since the board is now recognized as Axoloti Core and Axoloti Bulk Interace there will be no problem with connecting my Discovery board version of the beta axoloti.</p>

<p>personally I am not going to mess with the environment variable since I don't intend to use the Axo on this weird windows account anyway, but nice to know the reason for the error.</p>

              <p>indeed, we obviously have to assume some kind of 'defaults' for a new users setup, so that we don't have to have a complex installer, asking 100's of questions <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt="smile" width="64" height="64"> </p>

<p>anyway, it is however possible to override these things... as I anticipated some have particular setup requirements.</p>

<p>if you need to place the axoloti home directory somewhere else (this is where its stores its preferences/builds etc)</p>

<p>you just need to define the environment variable:<br><strong>axoloti_home</strong></p>

<p>this can be set to any valid directory, that you have write permissions... </p>

<p>if you run Axoloti from the command line, you will see it reports which directories is using.<br>(I've a bug in 1.0.1 that doesnt validate these correctly, but in 1.0.2 it will report if it has an issue with this... I'm also now going to fix it so it checks for write access to the home area :))</p>

<p>(Ive not detailed these yet in the docs yet, as i don't want to new users, to start moving things around without some guidance, it would create a support nightmare when we have so many new users about to come online in one go!)</p>
