    <title>Any interest in this line levels expander board?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/any-interest-in-this-line-levels-expander-board/5238</link>
    <description>Hello All!

I made this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTtwgmtcXRg

Is there any interest in me making this available?  It&#39;s all through hole, so it could be a kit.  Would just uploading the design files be good enough?  Questions, comments, criticisms, suggestions?   

If there&#39;s interest I might put more work into it, if there isn&#39;t interest then it is what it is.

I might also think about making a &quot;guitar pedal levels&quot; board, as the requirements are a little different.</description>

              <p>Yeah, the pcb will be way better than a protoboard.  I'll try and hash out a board that takes power from the main board so it can just be micro usb cable powered.  That seems to be the way to go.  I could also add a spot for a DC wall wart in case a usb cable isn't available.  I'd probably make the DC port center tip 9V so it would work with most guitar pedal supplies.</p>

<p>No such thing as a stupid question!  No real reason, it's just a matter of how you prefer to set the circuit up.  Someone asked me this same question in the comments of the vid and I gave a verbose response there about how virtual ground works.</p>

<p>Here's the schematic.  Just a voltage divider on each input and the simples op amp circuit conceivable on each output.  </p>

              <p>Hi! This is solving exactly the problem I am facing now. I'd like to use the Axoloti as an effects unit in the effects loop of my guitar amp but the signal is way too hot for Axoloti. Would you be so kind and post a schematic of it? I have a power supply that can run 9/12/18 V DC so maybe it could be used without the powering section that you designed.</p>

<p>Edit:<br>It's similar case as with the battery that you mentioned before.<br>Anyway, is there a special reason to use symetrical power? Sorry if that's a stupid question.</p>

              <p>Hey, thanks for the reply!  The board currently isn't designed for battery power.  The easiest option would be to to leave several components unpopulated and just solder two 9V battery clips to the board.</p>

<p>What I should have done is take the 5V from the usb power and put it into something like this:<br><a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/recom-power/RB-0512D/945-1105-ND/2256285" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/recom-power/RB-0512D/945-1105-ND/2256285</a></p>

<p>..that way it would just be powered off of the micro usb cord as normal and all you would need to do for battery power would be to use a portable usb charger.  I might update it to work this way.  I made this board about a year ago and have learned a few tricks since then.</p>
