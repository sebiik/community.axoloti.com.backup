    <description>Hey all!
I´ve uploaded a Video from a little Studio Session using two Axoloti Sampler Instruments that I made. The first one you hear is a very simple Sampler with 8 Audio Buffers, Pitchcontroll and a Step Sequencer. The second sampler you here is more like a Granular thing. There I already sampled some Trumpet Notes in advance.

              <p>Yes so the Sampler that I used to Sample the Percussion is this one:<br><a class="attachment" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/c/ca5b07b415ffee6108480f1250d8462bce6aed5f.axp">Slice Sampler.axp</a> (66.2 KB)<br>And the one that is doing the "Pad Sound" with the sampled trumpet is this one here:<br><a class="attachment" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/a/aaac20c57d8f8e87adddede6eb451e5abb96ce78.axp">samplerpoly9stereo.axp</a> (66.0 KB)</p>

<p>Actually they are both quite "simple" but what I like about the simplicity is that it brings so much inspiration and creativity. Sometimes I think about buying a device like an MPC or another more "HiFi" Sampler but I think all these options that those devices bring, that I am not able to build by myself, will more block my creativity. So I will keep on building my own little devices =) And I would be very gratefull for hints how to improve these samplers =)</p>
