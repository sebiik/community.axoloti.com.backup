    <title>Request: keyboard input object with device selection</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/request-keyboard-input-object-with-device-selection/785</link>
    <description>The only way i seem to be able to define a midi input device is by putting the &quot;keyb&quot; object in a polyphonic sub patcher. I had a quick look at the &quot;note&quot; code to see if i could move it over to a version of keyb, but suspect its a little beyond my current capabilities.</description>

<p>hmm, sounds like a 'bug' to me... I probably just forgot to add it.<br>I can see being able to filter both by device and channel would be useful for mono too...</p>

<p>not sure I understand this question...</p>
<p>you can put a keyb object in any patch (top level included) but of course it will be monophonic, but yes, I put the device selection on the patch level, as it would be quite a drag to have to specify it on the objects themselves. (and make the patch look complicated)</p>

<p>its not a bad practice, as can be useful if you later want to extend the patch to use different devices for different  samples/synthesis etc.</p>

<p>That's what i'm doing now. Not sub patcher but patch/patcher. Your reasoning seems logical.<br>One question though; Why doesn't a monophonic patch/patcher have device, port, channel selection? I just use a polyphonic set to 1 voice, but curious.</p>

<p>I'll stick to the patch/patcher now you've confirmed that's how it was intended to be used.</p>

<p>thanks for the reply.</p>
