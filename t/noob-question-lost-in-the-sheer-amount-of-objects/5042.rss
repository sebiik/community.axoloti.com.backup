    <title>Noob question - lost in the sheer amount of objects</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/noob-question-lost-in-the-sheer-amount-of-objects/5042</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m just starting out on my journey with the Axoloti.
I&#39;m having a lot of fun patching, but there are so many different implementations of every effect / object I&#39;d like to use that I have a hard time figuring out which is best for my purpose.

Example - I want to add a reverb.  
There are plenty to choose from in both factory and user submissions, so how do I figure out which is best for me?

Even for oscillators there are many implementations of f.e. a saw.

I don&#39;t suppose there&#39;s a post somewhere that &quot;rates&quot; different versions of the same object/effect by sound quality and CPU usage?

Say I want a nice reverb, how do I figure out which reverb sounds good, while getting an idea whether it&#39;s feasible to use in my patch CPU usage wise?

Testing every implementation of every effect/object I want to use will take years I&#39;m afraid - what is the best osc for me to use, the best chorus, the best reverb, the best ping pong delay implementation...  Or maybe not the best, but the one that&#39;s good enough without eating all CPU cycles..

Your tips on this (or on individual favorites - what are your go-to objects?) would be appreciated because I&#39;m stifled by the sheer amount of choice! :slight_smile:</description>

<p>welcome to axoloti!</p>

<p>well for me that is the fun about it, try stuff that others made, see if you like it. </p>

<p>my general rule of thumb would be to try the factory objects first, they are often fairly well optimised and sound good. if you find them lacking, start to look in the user library.</p>
