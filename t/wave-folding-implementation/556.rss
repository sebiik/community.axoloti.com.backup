    <title>Wave folding implementation</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/wave-folding-implementation/556</link>
    <description>does anyone have any experience with implementing wave folding?

I&#39;ve done this so far... which seems to work but I&#39;m not sure... and not happy with overdriving the input.

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/1X/c69737a13ee2fbf2e89a818fc75c639364cb5df2.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;343&quot;&gt;

as far as I understand folding is done but passing thru a cos function, and you then offset this by the folding amount.
yes, i know you can do it manually by reflecting, but the cos function seems to be the accepted away.
( note : I want to do keep the fold ration at audio rate, so i get modulate it at audio rate)

what also usually seems to be done is to overdrive (i.e. saturate) the input and output stages with a soft clipping function.
and its this last but I&#39;m not sure about... I&#39;m putting it thru a soft clip, but really I think I should be multiplying it by 1.x but if i do that it seems to hard clip immediately to 1/-1. 
how do i overdrive the input, such that i get soft clipping.   (like overdrive~) 

any other thoughts on wave folding on axoloti?</description>

<p>Edit</p>

<p>I made a V3. Start with a sine at low rate to see on the graph how it's working</p>

<p>if you dont mind, can you explain what the Feedback Fold is exactly? when I turn the FF dial up. it seems to add a great deal of white noise but not much else</p>

<p>keep in mind that my understanding of dsp is limited, and one of the goals for me (personally) is to better understand dsp through building objects like this and making a hilarious number of mis steps. i cant really explain the math behind what is going on, but read the first few posts and maybe youll understand why the subpatch is the way it is</p>

<p>in regards to your question, however, i built this object from <a class="mention" href="/users/thetechnobear">@thetechnobear</a>  and <a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> suggestions/conversations on the topic</p>

              <p>Hi everyone!</p>

<p>I just bought the axoloti for this kind of wave shaping possibility.</p>

<p>Do you think there is a way to morph the cosin function of the folder like in the Make Noise DPO (from sine to spike and then glitched triangle)?</p>

<p>also, is there a possibility to add a "horizontal bias" on the folding instead of a vertical one as in the patch above ? I think the Âµfold II has something called symmetry. Not sure of understanding everything btw. </p>

<p>At least what is exactly the wrap object and why there is "bits" entry. Why dial 3 ?</p>

<p>thanks everyone and especially Johannes for this wonderful gift.</p>

              <p>I'm not following completely here, I need a reference to a definition of "wave folding".</p>

<p>I suggest, to create a sine-function waveshaper, use math/sine, to add extra gain precede math/sine with math/wrap set to perhaps 3 bits, add a math/*c before to add gain control. And +c for offset/bias. <br>A sine wave (or cosine) is a good function to do repeated folding with a minimum of aliasing artifacts.</p>

<p>If you want to reflect the wave when outside a certain range - like harder than hard clipping, and end up with good quality, I suggest to build it with the dist/rectifier object, that is an alias-reduced version of a halfwave rectifier (y=x&gt;0?x:0).</p>
