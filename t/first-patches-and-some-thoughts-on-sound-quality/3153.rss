    <description>Hi All -

Just got my Axoloti here in San Diego. I put together a couple of patches fairly quickly just to see what she sounded like (I know there are demos, but I wanted to see what I could do and how it would sound).

One patch uses the Bowed brds oscillator in a generative setting with a touch of reverb. Fantastic.

The other is a basic two osc (saw and square) analog mono synth with an SVF filter and a little delay.  I drove that with my Zillion sequencer. Also fantastic.

I am pretty familiar with music programming and fluent in pd, max, Reaktor, and others.  I have a Nord Micro Mod, too.

My first impressions are that the patching environment is sophisticated and polished. Compiling and uploading is very quick, quick enough not to interfere with the creative process. The wealth of objects is staggering! And the sound is very high quality. So far I have not run into any artifacts or extraneous noise (except for the brds Blown osc which I could not get to behave correctly - I&#39;ll work on that and report back).

I am a happy, happy man :) the little Axoloti is terrific.

Mike

Here are the patches:

              <p>Thanks, guys.  Sorry for the late reply, I have been out of town.  I was indeed going to make the Mono-SVF synth poly, maybe I'll get to that tonight.  I have to build the AxoControl, too...</p>

              <p>Yes, the sound quality is top. I haven't run into any issues so far. Some care in the gainstaging helps to reduce noise. That is something people should be aware of: Axoloti is running with fixed-point numbers so low volume reduces the number of available bits and creates some tiny quantization noise. Keeping the audio volume high (but not clipping) at all places in the signal chain is key to reduce the effect.</p>

<p>The only thing I noticed is some noise in my own reverbs, but that is to be expected when you modulate the allpasses a k-rate without interpolating. The tiny noise generated there adds up in the reverb tail.<br>Anyway, I must admit that I actually like the reverb a little noisier, but some might prefer it quieter. Maybe I will add another version to my reverbs that does the modulation at audio rate?</p>
