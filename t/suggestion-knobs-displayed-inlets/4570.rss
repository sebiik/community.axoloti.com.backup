    <description>As someone who is seriously struggling with using this device, it would be really beneficial for me personally (and i assume others) if I was able to swap any knob I see with an inlet, ignoring the code behind it. the knob represents a value that is then interpreted by the code, if I could just swap that with an inlet or even an analog port directly in the interface it would take 80% of the hassle out of development for me.</description>
