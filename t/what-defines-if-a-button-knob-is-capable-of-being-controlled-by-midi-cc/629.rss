    <title>What defines if a button/knob is capable of being controlled by midi CC?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/what-defines-if-a-button-knob-is-capable-of-being-controlled-by-midi-cc/629</link>
    <description>Hey!

I am trying to control the ctrl/i with midi CC and that is not possible. But for example ctrl/toggle is capable of being controlled by midi. 

And then I was wondering what actually defines if a button/knob is capable of being controlled by midi CC? 

I looked at the code for those 2 object and don&#39;t seem to find any code that refers to midi capabability(I could easily be wrong since this is new teritory to me).

Any ideas? :)</description>

<p>well, if it was just only a few lines of code, it is easy to copy paste into a new installed versions as they come. Anyway, will se what happens, I dont want to mess the installation up. For now I'll dig a little deeper in axoloti and see what other solution there could be <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>I dont expect you to. I make new versions for different needs. Again that is what I like about Axoloti; it is customisable in many ways. Most need are for now covered with custom ctrl/i version, like 1-4, 1-8, 1-16, 1-32. 1-64, 1-128... So it it is not really that many or that complicated. But it just makes the patch more clean. If the ctrl/i is in a subpatch and controlling for example a muxer with 8 inputs and it has unlimited values.... It will easy drive beyond the muxers 8 inputs... with the 1-8 the ctrl/i just stops when it gets to 8. So you can only select the values that actually controls something <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>I dont really worry about that. If they like to use it, they could just do the same? What I really like about Axoloti is that it is customizable in almost any possible way.

<blockquote><p>ctrl/i is "rangeless", it can be adjusted to values that you then cannot reproduce via midi.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>Ive made a bunch og custom ctrl/i objects like 0-15, 1-16. 1-64, etc..... And adjust value to what I need, cause I prefer that you can not drive the ctrl/i beyond the maximum value needed. For example if you use the ctrl/i to select position of a sequencer with 64 steps. Then you dont want the ctrl/i to go beyond 64 steps, cause everything beyond is not used. There are many situations were this could be applied to(And that is also one of the reasons I also mentioned that a "dynamic version" of the ctrl/i would be nice, where you can set minimum and maximum value, maybe from axolotis own editor or something like that).</p>

<p>A little more explaining about this: This version doesnt have to go to rangeless. It just needs to stay within 128 steps... 0-127 .. with in midi range, That is perfect. and if you change the minimum value to 60, the midi cc value would probably still be 60. I am pretty sure if the ctrl/i CC object(i call it for reference) is set to send out 0-127 value it will still send out the correct values by defalut, even though you change minimum and maximum value. Like for example set minimum to 30 and max to 60 then it would probably also send out those midi values. But that is not so impotant, you can always adjust the output with math to give the values you need. The most important part is that it is midi cc assignable, so you can see the exact values when edited from external device or modulated from internal mod source.</p>

<p>That is stays within 0-127(probably easier to make cc compatible)<br>setting minimum and maximum can be done externally so I dont worry about that. DOesnt have to done inside, but would off course be welcome.</p>

<p>Another example of why I think the ctrl/i is a  better choice than the dial. <br>Accurate display of value:<br>I am using a homemade step lfo made from sel/sel i to trigger some drumloops.. Basically for slicing them. And to choose which exact step of the step lfo that is selected I use the ctrl/i. If you use a ctrl/dial you would have to guess from what position the dial exactly has. You can not see the exact value, like with the ctrl/i where you see it visually. For example 64 steps covers 16th notes over a range of 4 bars. If I want the loop to start from step 16(2. bar of the loop) and not 1(1.bar of the loop) it is way easier to set the value with ctrl/i in a live situation than doing it with a ctrl/dial. You can always see the exact value.</p>

<p>I also use the ctrl/i instead of the radio obejct.. cause the radio object are very big. /again here the "dynamic" version would be very nice.. still within 0-127).</p>

<p>Come to think of it.. A ctrl/dial, but with a different visual than a dial could do just fine. Maybe it is easier to make a version of the dial with a diffrent interface that shows values instead of a knob? THen it willl stay with in 0-127 no matter what <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>I kind of thought it would be as easy as changing the min/max value of the ctrl/i. That was pretty easy. But this seems like a bigger task.</p>

<p>There is a semantic difference between integer and fractional. Integer = counts, (almost) unlimited range, green wires. Fractional = fraction of a certain maximum value, blue and red wires. MIDI mixes these semantics all the time...<br>If you need the 0-127 range you're probably dealing with the fractional interpretation, and I recommend to use ctrl/dial. </p>

<p>Yeah I just checked it doesnt monitor the value.</p>

<p>I also use a lot of the disp/i object. But the problem is I have used the ctrl/i in almost all my patches and a lot of them. So I would have to change all patches I have made. To me it makes more sense to reprogram the ctrl/i for a new version than changing all patches. I will have to create it eventually cause I prefer that object over the dials, etc. and also cause they take a lot less space and I like to look at numbers instead of th dial <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> And it is also different looking at the actual number move that a display...  </p>

<p>But I dont really understand what is going on in the java code. It looks way different than the XML code. I dont see anything referring to 0-127.. </p>

<p>PS. Where do I locate that file in Axoloti content on Mac? <br>Edit1: Found it! <br>Edit2: No didnt find it anyway. Thought I did but the mac search engine lcated an older version i compiled from Git. I cant find the file in latest release</p>

<p>Why not use "midi/in/cc i"? Ok that does not allow tweaking the value from a patch, or monitoring the value. Monitoring can be added with a disp/i object.</p>

<p>Will get it and test it <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>Did you just edit in the XML editor or is this done in java? I would really like to know where to look, so I can try and make a 0-127 version of the ctrl/i that reacts on midi CC. That shouldnt be too hard as long as the range is within midis range(128), right? And it would solve a lot of issues in my setup.</p>

<p>Any input is welcome <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> (You can PM me if you like instead of here).</p>

<p>EDIT: just checked on Github. Couldnt find it there... New release is always welcome <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>I fixed the midi mapping for the "ctrl/i radio *" objects, new release coming soon...</p>

<p>"ctrl/i" is still not mappable, since its range does not make sense to be mapped to MIDI.</p>

<p>Custom minimum and maximum values for controls need deep thought on the user interface. I'd like to avoid object properties dialogs as much as possible. My intention is that one should be able to reconstruct a patch from a screenshot. This is already not the case with midi mapping, presets, and modulations - at least the "C","P" and "M" indicates that a parameter has extended settings, but that is only the case with dials, sliders and (radio) buttons do not have this indications.</p>

<p>For just controlling from an external midi device and change simple things like for example selecting 1 of 3 lfos or 1 of 3 filters..... your set up, will work fine.</p>

<p>But I am aiming for using midi cc to control parametes internally in Axoloti(to show visually what is going on in the patch.. Youll see when the parameters move if they are controlled my midi cc) as well as controlling from external device. </p>

<p>Anyway, will see what happens down the road. I have a friend who studies at the University where Miller Puckette is associate director and he is learning to program java as we speak. I hope he might be able to help us out(if developers are looking in other directions than what I am thinking of). </p>

<p>Anyway, Axoloti is still really killer.. Just a small bump in the road. When I started building bigger patches I didnt check which buttons/knobs/etc. were cc controlable. Should have checked it befor I went to deep. Coming from Nord G2 I just assumed all parameters were assignable.</p>

              <p>I apologize, i didnt use a button, i used something a bit more complex that i think of as a "button" as it is a trigger from a button on my midi controller.

<p>Erm i was a bit misleading also with the second portion, the second portion determines in this case whether an ADSR, or the LFO's are modulating the cutoff of a filter</p>

<p>This is a part of a virtual analog polysynth patch i made, i can post the full patch if you want, but its very CPU heavy and can only be ran in four voices to my memory. I have a paired down one with only two lfo wave forms and two osc wave forms that can be ran in 6 voice poly as well. There is another mod matrix which selects OSC wave forms, but it is essentially the same concept.</p>

<p>I know there might be something about midi cc only goes from 0-127. and some parameters goes way beyond that... But that side works in other programs, so it is also possible to program in Axoloti.</p>

<p>I dont believe it is hard to implement MIDI cc in all The control objects. It Would probably be a copy/paste job. And it seems like it Might have been intendede to have MIDI cc for the controller objects...... But it just doesnt work yet.</p>

<p>Going to test that for sure. But it would much nicer with the ctrl/i with midi, cause then you also would be able to actually see which filter, lfo , etc, that is actually selected(by looking at the number of the ctrl/i).</p>

              <p>Yes some of the ctrl objects allows you to assign a midi cc but when you try to make the patch live, it wont work.  I havent found out how to work around it yet. Johannes says it needs to be adressed in java code not in XML. I just started on XML and dunno much about programming java... yet <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> .... Anyway,,,, I will test it tommorow if it might work by editing in XML. I havent given up on this. I need the ctrl object to be midi assignable in my setup. If I could watch a video of someone adding midi cc  to one obejct, i could do it myself and not "waste" developers time om stuff like this. I just need an example and I can do it on my own and of course share with everyone in here <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>BUT..... This is kind of a workaround:<br>Assign the filter selection to 4 presets and use preset system to change filter type. Presets should work for the ctrl/i. But this is not really a good solution, cause it takes up ALL presets features.. but it should be possible.</p>

<p>But in general I think the ctrl objects should all be midi assignable, but I dont know how big a programming task it is to do that. But I would gladly help make it happen so everyone can enjoy that feature <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> I managed to make new versions of the ctrl/i with only 1-16 instead of 0-64000. That makes more sense in my set up... Especially the ctrl/i object would be REALLY nice to have a dynamic version of... SO you can set minimum and maximum value manually( maybe from Axolotis own object editor, so we dont have leave Axoloti editor to do this) <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> Is this something you have thought about? <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
