    <title>Modulation woes, help this nooblecake</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/modulation-woes-help-this-nooblecake/939</link>
    <description>I am currently trying to use the modulation sources/destinations, and I&#39;m not really sure what the hell to do to get it working...

So, I have a bunch of pots, a couple encoders, and a toggle switch, with all input logic tucked away in my input_subpatch. Each input has a corresponding outlet.

In the parent patch, I have the outputs (from the sub-patch) routed into modulation sources. Also, I have a couple of dials in this parent-patch set to use some of these modulation sources. However, when I turn my potentiometers, I am never able to modulate anything else. I also tried hooking up the trig input on the modulation source object to a square wave lfo which outputs a boolean, but that didn&#39;t seem to work, either. One last thing, I can see that my potentiometers are sending out valid data...

anyone have any ideas or tips on how to use the modulation sources feature?


EDIT:
So, I found that I was doing nothing wrong at all, as when I tried to set an object in my parent-patch to be a modulation-destination, it all worked as expected. **My problem is that I cannot modulate an exposed parameter for a sub-patch. Is this a bug?**</description>

              <p>Seems like you can't modulate parameters on a subpatch.
