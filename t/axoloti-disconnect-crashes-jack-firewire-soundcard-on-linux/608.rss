    <title>Axoloti disconnect crashes Jack/Firewire soundcard on linux</title>

    <description>Hi,
I&#39;m using Axoloti along with some other tools on my laptop, interconnected via midi (usb device port).
Axoloti shows up as a alsa-midi device and I can connect to/from it without any problems.
This is excellent!
However...
When Axoloti disconnects for some reason (pulling out the usb cable, or crashing a, .axp...) it makes Jack and/or the firewire soundcard hang. So far I only got it working again by rebooting the laptop...
Has anyone had this, and do you have suggestions?
Tim
EDIT: for completeness, I should add that disconnecting/reconnecting at least one other midi device (i.e. Keystation Mini 32) doesn&#39;t cause this problem. It simply disappears from Jack&#39;s Connections window and reappears, and everything keeps working. Any idea what&#39;s different with the Axoloti Core midi device?
EDIT: looks like it&#39;s not disconnecting the Axoloti Core that causes the problem, but reconnecting it (Jack hangs when plugging in Axoloti Core while running)
EDIT: ok, been doing some more testing, turns out it&#39;s not _always_ crashing... that doesn&#39;t help in finding the cause... no idea what&#39;s going on. For now I&#39;ll just avoid disconnecting while using Jack/alsamidi... :smile:</description>
