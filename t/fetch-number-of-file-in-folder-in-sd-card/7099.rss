    <title>Fetch number of file in folder in SD card</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/fetch-number-of-file-in-folder-in-sd-card/7099</link>
    <description>Hi all!

I&#39;m working on a kind of rhythm machine based mainly on sample. I would like to be able to load Raw samples on different folders and not having to go inside the patch to mention the program how much raw file there is in a folder.

So I wanted to know if there is a method so that the patch will, at a certain point, fetch the number of file inside a certain folder and return it as an integer value.

Thanks!</description>

<p>At the moment it is working but I still need to resolve some trouble in my patch: I'm actually using it in some kind of drum machine. When I press a button, my patch is looking for a sample folder and the samples inside this folder are played/streamed directly to the output of the AXO. <br>But it seems that the Axo does not like having different operations on the SD card at the same time: when i change the folder and the custom object is browsing the files, there is a digital blip/glitch if a sample is being played at the same time.</p>

<p>I might have to ask the object to browse every folder at the start of the patch, before playing samples, and store the values of the number of files in each folder in tables so I can recall it while playing.</p>

<p>So basically each time I press the "change folder path" button, it triggers the reset, then a delayed pulse object triggers the Findfree inlet.</p>

<p>It seems to work well like this but it seems to need at least 100ms of delay beatween the triggers, otherwise it stays stuck at cnt=0.</p>

              <p>thanks a lot for your help!<br>I managed to make it work thanks to your examples.<br>Now the only problem is that when I change the prefix (the path of the folder to scrape) the amount of files only updates when it is higher than the previous one.<br>For an example, if a folder has 10 files in it, it will output 10, but if the nex one has less, like 5, the output will stay at 10.<br>Weirdâ€¦</p>

<p>It currently does seem to count the files, but not sure it's actually working correctly..<br>I've used your code to create the string, but made one change. I've added the part where it gets the offset.<br>Then the strcat uses this offset to see where it needs to add the 000suffix, as I think your version overwrites the prefix part..</p>

<pre><code>strcpy(&amp;c[0],inlet_prefix);

              <p>oef, it's a bit hard to get this module changed because of the header-problem we mentioned earlier.<br>Had to do quite a search again for the project that I build this in.</p>

<p>Remember, that, to change this module, you cannot embed it. You first need to save it to a folder of your own (so not in my sss-folder, but I assume you've already done this).</p>

<p>So once it's in your own folder that also contains the header file, you'll need to change the code without embedding the module and overwrite/save the module after you've changed something.</p>

<p>As you only need the amount of files in a folder,you'ld only need this part of the K-rate code:</p>

<p>if(inlet_findFree&amp;&amp;!ntrig){<br>	stop=0;<br>	ntrig=1;<br>}<br>else if((!inlet_findFree)&amp;&amp;ntrig){ntrig=0;}</p>

<p>while(!stop){<br>   int i = cnt;<br>   int i0 = i/10;<br>   C[offset+2] = '0'+i-10*i0;<br>   i = i0; i0 = i/10;<br>   C[offset+1] = '0'+i-10*i0;<br>   i = i0; i0 = i/10;<br>   C[offset+0] = '0'+i-10*i0;<br>   FIL FileObject;<br>   FRESULT err;<br>  err = f_open(&amp;FileObject, &amp;C[0], FA_READ | FA_OPEN_EXISTING);<br>if (err == FR_OK) {cnt+=1;}<br>else if(err!=FR_OK){stop=1;}<br>}</p>

<p>indeed, the "cnt-1" will show you the last file that is in use (so "cnt" is the amount of samples, where the samples start at index 000 up to index cnt-1)</p>

<p>for changing the prefix into an inlet, I'll need to experimentate a bit.. not sure if I can get it to work yet..</p>

              <p>Hello <a class="mention" href="/u/sirsicksik">@SirSickSik</a> </p>

<p>I have been trying to finish and clean a patch that I'm working on lately. I'm using your findFree object but i'd like to use only one instance of it to find the number of files in multiple folders.<br>Basically, i just need to have the "prefix" as an inlet instead of an attribute. I have been trying to use strcat in your code in such a way:</p>

<p><strong>strcpy(&amp;c[0],inlet_prefix);</strong><br><strong>strcat(&amp;c[0],"000attr_suffix");</strong><br><strong>strcpy(&amp;C[0],inlet_prefix);</strong><br><strong>strcat(&amp;C[0],"000attr_suffix");</strong></p>

<p>It was not working if I was putting this code inside the init code tab so i moved it to K-rate code tab (I deducted this while studying the concat objects).</p>

<p>The path is right if I output both the <strong>c</strong> and <strong>C</strong> strings but the "free" display dos not light up and my "amount" outlet that I added in your code (outlet_amount=cnt;) only outputs 0.</p>

<p>Do you have any idea what goes wrong here?</p>

<p>Also, for the sake of saving SRAM, I'd like to erase all other functions that i'm not using, could you point me to what chunks of code I can delete?</p>

<p>thanks a lot!</p>

<p>best</p>
