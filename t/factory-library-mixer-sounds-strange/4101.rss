    <title>Factory library mixer sounds strange?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/factory-library-mixer-sounds-strange/4101</link>
    <description>Good evening!

To night I was experimenting a bit with a mixer I made and bypassed the whole mixer and realised the mixer sounded really strange, compared to the clean signal. So, okay, I thought it was my mixer that went sour, but then I went all the way back to the factory mixer I used as starting point for my own mixer..... And realised it is also a problem in the factory mixer. Each of the factory mixers I tried tonight has the issue.

Would someone be kind and check this patch and test it, if its me who is going  nuts here or something has went sour in my local library that has screwed up something?

Its easy to test, just push the button in the top right corner to test the 3 ways in the test. Here the 2. one, the mixer, sounds strange, the clean signal and using a vca sounds perfectly fine.

Here is the patch:

              <p>Thank you <a class="mention" href="/u/patatos">@patatos</a> . Didn't really expect it to be the pink noise object, so didnt even check that..... I actually started all over and build a new mixer instead <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  Which came out better than all the ones that I build before so something good came out of it <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">   </p>

<p>But very nice to know that it was not just me. And suddenly I started thinking about if it has always been like that, but as far as i remember they all sounded fine before. </p>

<p>I have had other objects where I experienced some unwanted cross talk between objects. I dont know it it has been fixed, but for example the mutable instruments stuff would only let you load one of each object at a time. If you loaded more than one you would get harsh noises.</p>

<p>Anyway, glad to have it debunked so I dont have to remake all the mixers i put in the community library.</p>

              <p>Hi jaffasplaffa... Your observation caught my attention, being the mixer one of the most useful objects in patching, so I have done some experiments too. I have come to the conclusion that <strong>the culprit is not the mixer (whew!) but the object called pink/oct.</strong>   I did a simple patch like yours in order to compare two signals cancelling them inverting the phase of one and summing. Loading the patch you should not hear any sound, as the two signals cancels out exactly. Moving the first selector at the position three  (pink/oct selected) you hear a signal! This means that the signal coming out from the mixer is somewhat altered, but this happens only with the pink/oct object! The second selector is here to check other kind of objects bypassing the adsr, again the pink/oct has problems. The pink/oct interacts with the adsr too, if attack is long and release short the weird behavior disappears. This happens also when the attribute parameter is 5 or 6. So let's use the mixer without worries...<img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/grinning.png?v=5" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:"> Here is the patch:<a class="attachment" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d4280914ae98a547c73065e91f2bb2f723e99111.axp">pretty.axp</a> (9.5 KB)</p>
