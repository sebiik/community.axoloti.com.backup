    <title>Replacing usb connector with something more robust</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/replacing-usb-connector-with-something-more-robust/4753</link>
    <description>So I hate the micro usb connector on the Axoloti.

I would ideally replace it with the usb type b connector.

Has anyone explored this? Micro usb plugs and jacks seem to loose connectivity easily leaving me frustrated in my small studio or when I travel.

I havent looked for any jacks with a similar foot pribt.  Im also open to the idea of addibg a whole other usb jack to a set of io pins if that could be done.

Also, If the boards get a revision: please use usb type b or AT LEAST type c.

Thoughts?

Cheers

              <p>I don't see any problems with using a different connector with the same number of connections as the Micro-USB connector. You just have to match pin-for-pin and hand wire the connector since the spacing will never match. The problems with some connectors is that they are specified for different current delivery. There may be a problem with the type-c connectors which are designed to do the job of both a USB-A and USB-B connector so using one on the Axo would be replacing both of the USB connectors.</p>
