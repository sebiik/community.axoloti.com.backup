    <title>Axoloti/Volca (Question about Volca Bass)</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/axoloti-volca-question-about-volca-bass/3537</link>
    <description>I was thinking of creating a little Axoloti/Volca setup, so that I could feed a Volca into the Axoloti and use it as a purpose-designed effects processor, maybe even with some recording/sampling abilities thrown in.

Question though; does anyone here have a KORG Volca Bass?

I was thinking of getting one but I can&#39;t find out something I need to know.  To be honest, I initially dismissed the Volca Bass as a poinlessly crippled product due to them not giving it key sync on the LFO.  But I read recently (and have seen videos) about an update that adds tempo sync to the LFO.

Clearly I wasn&#39;t the only one who thought it was pointlessly crippled, but it does beg the question, does this sync update extend to triggering a note manually as well?

What I mean is, if I manually trigger a note, either by MIDI or the on-board keys (without a pattern running) will it reset the LFO on each key press, or does the new sync work strictly only while a pattern is running?

I need it to have key sync on the LFO (like the Volca Keys does).  I did register on korgforums.com last week, so that I could ask about it there, but I never got an activation email so cannot log-in and ask about it.  I even sent an email to the webmaster, but no reply.  It&#39;s as if my emails are being blocked.</description>

              <p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>While I'm still interested to see if the Bass can do what I wanted of it, it doesn't really matter now.  I think I'll be able to squeeze what I want onto a single Axoloti.  And even if I can't, I think I'd be better-off investing in a second Axoloti which I can tailor to my needs, and just feed one into the other.</p>

<p>So, not important now, although I'm still curious.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the reply, I was just looking for the video to show you what I meant and come across another one where someone from KORG says there's sync stuff that's a hidden feature and was added after the manuals were printed.</p>

<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="EYlWLzdPgyg" data-youtube-title="Using the Volca Bass LFO sync" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>

<p>Basically, I need the Triangle LFO to keysync.  The manual you show says it doesn't, but he talks about this stuff being added after the manuals were printed.  I read earlier that it was added in an update, so maybe they got it wrong.  Either way, the LFO has to be able to key-sync using the Triangle wave or it would be a bit too limited for my needs.  If the LFO could be keysynced on Triangle, it would act as a second Attack/Decay that could be used independently of the main one.  So, one for pitch, one for filter - rather than combined.  You would be able to do this on the Volca Keys due to the keysync, but I'm not so sure with the Volca Bass.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a square LFO would be completely useless for that.</p>

              <p>I have the Volca Bass, but can't find anything about an official firmware update for the Volca Bass. Maybe somebody did a mod or something.</p>

<p>The manual says that the square wave LFO is triggered at note on, the triangle wave LFO is not. Can't test it right now.</p>
