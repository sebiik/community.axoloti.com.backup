</div></a></div><br>Anyway, the plan is to put the Axoloti at the end of my signal chain before the loop station and have 2 primary effects...<br>1. Some type of doppler panner like the one in <a href="https://mqtthiqs.github.io/parasites/warps.html#doppler" rel="nofollow noopener">the parasites firmware upgrade for warps</a><br>Possibly controlled by a joystick... also a huge fan of volume sensing and responsive effects<br>2. best delay ever, with various effects only applied to the trails... Ive wanted to do this for a long time and have attempted it by splitting a wet signal chain off my delay, but never as cool as I wanted...<br>Hoping for modulation, bit crush, distortion, pitch shift, whatever... feeding back and creating chaos with too many knobs and switches.... Fulliy distinct Left/Right separation with variable feed back bleed between so I can run them against each other...</p>

<p>I was also considering using an arduino for the control surface so I can have a display and be all fancy.<br>Anyway, I figured you guys might be able to point me in the right direction or tell me Im crazy and save me some time. <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>Nice to see another guitarist join the Axoloti community.<br>There is a plethora of resource already on this forum, and plenty of support along the way.<br>Don't know if you are crazy ?, but highly unlikely to be going in the wrong direction with an Axoloti unless you are planning on taking it on a romantic date, that could be a sign if you are crazy or not. <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eyeae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"><br>I have notice you have already read some of my posts, a lot of my setup is based around being able to incorporate more change the other guitar effect systems out there, all has to be foot controlled, has to be as cheap as possible, so I do recycle a lot of parts, are research for alternative cheap solutions.<br>My ideas when I first got the Axo are very different to were I am now, and that is due to the Axo community, opening my eyes to possibilities.<br>So I would say, you are always in the right direction, but let it evolve and change direction.<br>Who knows where you end up...<img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/grinae52.png?v=5" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>

        <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="../../../u/damonp.html">@damonp</a>, and welcome.  I'm a guitar player also and live not all that far from you, compared to most Axoloti users (who seem to be in Europe, at least that's my impression).  I have to think about your ideas in more detail, but on the surface they seem pretty do-able to me.  I always find that the challenge is that the ideas in my head do not always end up sounding like I think they will when put into practice.  But usually along the way I find something that sounds cool and end up turning it into a song or something.  </p>

<p>Did you find my little intro for guitarists?  Here's the forum link, in case you didn't:  <a href="../../starting-points-for-guitarists/3809.html">https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/starting-points-for-guitarists/3809</a><br><a class="mention" href="../../../u/valmir.html">@valmir</a>'s guitar effects, also mentioned in that thread, include some nice ones that I also play regularly.  </p>

<p>Lately my development effort has been in other directions but I have tons of unfinished ideas for Axoloti.  So keep the exchange going here on the forum... I'm personally interested in what you figure out and I bet I would use your patches if you shared them!</p>

        <p>Cool... Yeah, I ended up here because I want crazier stuff than exists in the standard pedals... Im pretty maxed out in that regard... I started looking at eurorack stuff and ended up looking at the axoloti. <br>The doppler is the first chunk I want to bite off. I think it will be pretty easy once I get my head around how the objects work and interact.<br>I will of course share anything I do <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>Yeah, well, I share the interest in going 'beyond' what you can get commercially (although, honestly, the pedal world has pushed pretty far so I always wonder if there is much of a 'beyond' in terms of new sounds).  One thing I would definitely say though is that what Axoloti excels at is helping you to control effects in novel ways, rather than create wholly new sounds.  A good reason to play with some of the more straightforward Axoloti effects is so that you can start to brainstorm novel ways of controlling them.  I saw that you took a look at my little light-based controller and that's an example.. as far as guitar sounds, that project is using an Axoloti reverb and a bitcrusher (nothing groundbreaking as far as guitar sounds)...but the novelty is in the ability to synchronize a volume modulation of those effects to other instruments and things that are happening elsewhere.</p>

        <p>I certainly agree with <a class="mention" href="../../../u/kat.html">@kat</a>,  Axoloti is offering novel ways to control effects, the area I believe is some what unachievable for pedals is unique way of triggering events, the Axo patcher provides an excellent environment to explore this with software and hardware, what else is actually available out there, I haven't used them, but they do appear to lack flexibility in one area or another etc, how many guitar pedals allow you to mix osc's, and sequencers, filters, LFO's and so on all in one package. For me, I think in terms of performance within a patch made up with ever changing sounds, controls and patterns for a desired outcome, rather then specific sounds.<br>Just plug in the guitar and let it react to what I am doing.....<img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eyeae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"><br>I'm not lucky enough to live in the country of opportunity or Europe. !
