    <title>Account problems and order info</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/account-problems-and-order-info/5076</link>
    <description>Hi everyone,

I had some problems to get information on my order and create an account, I&#39;ll explain better:

Thursday, October 18 I bought a core axoloti but I have not received an email order confirmation so I wrote to _johannes.taelman@gmail.com_ for info, but no answer.

I suspected that it was a problem with my email address and in fact, using another email address, I created my account! : -)

Now I hope that here is the right place to ask for information on shipping and estimated delivery times or, better, an order tracking number and so on.

thank you in advance
