    <title>Using axoloti as a midi controller brain?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/using-axoloti-as-a-midi-controller-brain/1272</link>
    <description>So im thinking about a project that axoloti might fit.

I might  be getting a hardware synth in the future that sends and recieves midi CC. The problem is that the synth only as some encoders and not pots/switches for alle paramaters. I would  like to have that. So im thinking about making a midi controller for it using the axoloti as the brain.

As i understand it, Axoloti can only have 16 analog inputs. Have anyone gotten around this by multiplexing?

Basically i want to make sure i have a complete blueprint before i buy and axoloti. What i want to do is this:1:
 Use the axoloti as a midi controller brain for up to 64 controllers. 
That (as far as i understand things) can only be done via multiplexing).
 These will be a mix of on/off switches(the &quot;digital&quot; keybord type. Not a
 throw-switch) and analog pots. (not endless encoders). The midi will be
 recieved via the Axolotis USB port, and send into a hardware synth. I *dont* want any laggy pots. Everything has to be realtime/fast!

2:Recieve
 midi CC from the synth. If certain midi CCs meet a certain 
criteria=light up an LED.

3(low priority): Soft 
takeover function=Lets say i turn my cutoff knob to the CC value of 64. I
 then change the synth preset. The new internal value of the cutoff is 
now 102. When i turn the knob of my cutoff, the synth should not respond
 imidiatly, but wayt till i turn the knob all the way down to 64 and 
from there i can change it.I want to 
make sure that someone has done at least the 2 first steps with axoloti,
 and there is a &quot;blueprint&quot;/project i can use before i buy the Axoloti.

Thanks!!!</description>

It's cheap and it also works as an USB-midi device. An arduino uno can also act as a usb-midi device with the help of <a href="https://github.com/ddiakopoulos/hiduino" rel="nofollow">HIDUINO</a> or <a href="https://github.com/kuwatay/mocolufa" rel="nofollow">MOCO</a>:<br></p><div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="qVSB4EGV0tY" data-youtube-title="miniAtmegatron Tutorial - Arduino Uno MIDI-hack (Windows)" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>

<p>I would prefer a midibox or arduino based solution. For arduinos the main work will be copy/paste and edit your code for the need of your 64pot project.</p>

              <p>So. Johannes are you saying that making a midi controller brain is with axoloti requres a lot of extra work because its not really made to work that way? I really like the "openess" of axoloti. I have been taking a closer look at midibox and it seems pretty complex to set up. Iths very open though. Livid Brain v2 looks cool and is very straightforward but there a lots of things you cant do, it seems. Axoloti seems perfect in the sense that its very modular and i can do lots of stuff in software that i cant do with the other solutions... well well.. choices choices!<img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>The Livid Builder Brain looks like a pretty decent board. You can connect up to 128 buttons, 192 LEDs, and 64 analog controls. <a href="http://shop.lividinstruments.com/brain-v2/" rel="nofollow">http://shop.lividinstruments.com/brain-v2/</a></p>

              <p>yeah the whole preset restore, will be very specific to the synth.<br>unless your using a lot of 'factory presets' from the synth, id be tempted to keep them on the axoloti, Id suspect this will save you a lot of headaches!</p>

<p>one other thing you might want to consider on the soft takeover, is you will probably need some kind of visual feedback... imagine your restoring a patch, you may have no idea what the current value of some of the pots are.<br>(the virus actually has a simple LED that flashes, when the knob matches the patches saved value)</p>

<p>you'd also need to check if your synth gives any visual feedback on the LCD when getting values from midi input, I know the Virus does not. otherwise you could be twisting knobs aimlessly trying to find the current value, ok for one control, but would get 'tiring' if you were doing a whole bunch of parameter changes.</p>

<p>soft takeover has some disadvantages e.g. imagine physical knob for cutoff is at 30%, preset has it 90% and you want to get to 35%, you have to twist it to 90% then back to 35%.<br>its kind of why endless encoders work better... so you work in relative values.</p>

              <p>Thanks.<br>The USB64 looks good, but also kind of limited. But thanks for the link:)<br>The setup is this:<br>I plan on getting a Use audio plugiator hardware synthesizer. Its a hardware synth with not too many knobs. Back in the day you would program it from a vsti plugin. I dont want to program it from the computer, but would like full hands on control.<br>the synth has different emulations, but i will mostly be using the arp oddesy emulation.</p>

<p>The synth has midi in/through via DIN plugs and midi out via usb.<br>All the synth parameters can be accesed via midi CC. So my thought was to build a panel with faders and switches to control the arp emulation.<br>As it is now, axoloti only accepts 16 analog inputs. But via multiplexing i would get up to 64 analog inputs. I need some extra electronics for that, but it doesnt seem to complicated.</p>

<p>So the buttons/pots are connected to the Axoloti via analog inputs (maybe buttons can be connected via the digital inputs?). They are read there and translated into midi CC. The midi is then sent out to the plugiator synthesizer via the din cable. That would be the first and most important step.</p>

<p>The next step would be to load presets. I will do that on the actual synthesizer- I actually dont know if loading a preset will send out a bunch of midi CC values or sysex. I dont have a super deep knowledge of midi, but im suspecting sysex is the most common way to handle presets.  But if you say that handling sysex is not supported in axoloti, i guess this is not an option. (i'll have to check later once i get the synth).</p>

<p>As you said, i could store my presets on the axoloti instead.</p>

<p>The thing about the LEDs is tied to restoring patches (mostly). When i restore a patch i want the corresponding LEDS to light up/turn off if they are on/off.<br>Lets say there is a push button on called "LFO routed to VCA" (or whatever) on my diy controller. Beneath that, there should be a LED. It should light up if activated i press that button and if the function is activated by a preset. So:<br>If a preset is restored where the "LFO routed to VCA" function is activated, the LED beneath the button on the diy controller should light up.</p>

<p>Soft takeover is not that important right now, but would be great in the future.<br>Does this stuff make sense?<br>Thanks a lot for you time and help:)</p>

              <p>Im a bit confused about if your planning on using midi input or analog pots.</p>

<p>I assume analog pots, since with midi multiplexing would not be needed, Ive not done anything on the hardware side yet, but Im sure someone else will comment... but it sounds like you would need an external electronics to do the multiplexing (which I'm sure you know already) <br>if your not deep into electronics you might want to consider the Doepher USB64 which kind of does what your describing. (its not cheap, but looks easy to use) </p>

<p>(2) seems simple enough, just digital output. there are a few topics on this and I think on LEDs<br>I think <a class="mention" href="/users/janvantomme">@janvantomme</a> book may also cover this.</p>

<p>(3) soft takeover, this will depends a bit on what your doing, and the synth you are connecting too.<br>the issue is, axoloti needs to know what the current value on the synth is, then its 'trivial'</p>

<p>so... <br>IF you are planning to store the presets on axoloti, then its easy enough to do.</p>

<p>IF however you are planning to use the knobs on your synth, or load presets from your synth. then implementing this will depend what information your synth sends back to you.</p>

<p>e.g.<br>Ive a Virus TI, and have been considering doing something similar.... (slightly different as I want it as a sequencer)</p>

<p>for the Virus, I know that it sends many things back via CC but not all, some are sent as sysex.<br>also presets would be tricky, since when you change patch you don't get changes for all the values updated. but it does have the ability to send you the patch data via sysex. <br>of course then I have to map hundreds of parameters within axoloti  (actually not too hard for the Virus as I have a spreadsheet with all the mappings <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> ) </p>

<p>(note: receiving sysex is currently not supported in the axoloti firmware)</p>

<p>I mention this, to give you an idea of whats involved... as whilst your unlikely talking about a Virus TI,  Id say the TI's approach is not uncommon,  as it keeps the amount of data reasonable (midi din is slow!) and also overcomes the 127 CC limit. some other synths may use NRPNs for the later rather than sysex.</p>

<p>of course if your synth has fewer parameters, its all going to be a lot simpler !</p>

              <p>Thanks again:) The cool thing about multiplexing is that you actually <em>can</em> use all pots at the same time. So no need for sub menus etc. By scanning each pot fast enough and if some hardware knows which knob it is scanning, you can control all pots at the same time. This is the way its been done in old analog synths that had memory/midi etc.</p>

<p>Now i totally get what you are doing. But its not exactly the same thing i am trying to do:)</p>

<p>Setting up the routing in Axoloti software I think is preffered... Just connect 8 potentiometers and then route them in the software to what ever you want...</p>

<p>Anyway, Axoloti is only 100 euro, so it is not that expensive. And LOADS of fun.

              <p>Haha. Sorry, maybe I did not explain it will. </p>

<p>4X4 is 4 knobs, with each 4 functions/subgroups. This is very similr to how Blofeld works. Blofeld ONLY has got 4 knobs to control 100s of parameters. SO it is split up into subgroups of 4 knobs each. Check Waldorfs page for images on Blofeld set up.</p>

<p>Ahh ok. I might be misunderstanding the hardware side. I didnt get that far yet. Havent connected anything yet. I didnt feel comfortable doing it, but now Jan Van Tomme book have been updated with info on how to do it, I might give it a go.</p>

<p>Check this picture. This is how I have set it up. 1-4 is basicly each subgroup. Which could be set up for:<br>1. Oscillator<br>2. Filter<br>3. Effect<br>4. Etc.</p>

<p>Example for filter subgroup:<br>a=cutoff, b=reso, c= filterenv am d=filter lfo am</p>

<p>So each subgroup(1-4) has got 4 parameters a, b, c, d. I am pretty sure this set up will work. I havent got my axos right now, but when i do get them back, I can test it out. I dont see any reason why this setup wouldnt work with potentiometers. </p>

<p>This makes sense?</p>

Thanks:)</p></blockquote></aside><br>Though i cant say i fully understand all the bits that have to be done in order for it to work. I understand the principle.</p>

<p>What is i2c?</p>

<p>Thanks a gazillion!<img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

              <p>So im thinking about a project that axoloti might fit.</p>

<p>I might  be getting a hardware synth in the future that sends and recieves midi CC. The problem is that the synth only as some encoders and not pots/switches for alle paramaters. I would  like to have that. So im thinking about making a midi controller for it using the axoloti as the brain.</p>

<p>As i understand it, Axoloti can only have 16 analog inputs. Have anyone gotten around this by multiplexing?</p>

<p>Basically i want to make sure i have a complete blueprint before i buy and axoloti. What i want to do is this:1:<br> Use the axoloti as a midi controller brain for up to 64 controllers. <br>That (as far as i understand things) can only be done via multiplexing).<br> These will be a mix of on/off switches(the "digital" keybord type. Not a<br> throw-switch) and analog pots. (not endless encoders). The midi will be<br> recieved via the Axolotis USB port, and send into a hardware synth. I <em>dont</em> want any laggy pots. Everything has to be realtime/fast!</p>

<p>2:Recieve<br> midi CC from the synth. If certain midi CCs meet a certain <br>criteria=light up an LED.</p>

<p>3(low priority): Soft <br>takeover function=Lets say i turn my cutoff knob to the CC value of 64. I<br> then change the synth preset. The new internal value of the cutoff is <br>now 102. When i turn the knob of my cutoff, the synth should not respond<br> imidiatly, but wayt till i turn the knob all the way down to 64 and <br>from there i can change it.I want to <br>make sure that someone has done at least the 2 first steps with axoloti,<br> and there is a "blueprint"/project i can use before i buy the Axoloti.</p>

<p>Thanks!!!</p>
