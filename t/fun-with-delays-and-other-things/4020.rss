    <title>Fun with delays (and other things)</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/fun-with-delays-and-other-things/4020</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve posted this video in an other thread, but I thought it might be useful for more people, so I&#39;m making a thread about it:
This is a simple video of the making of a 8 track delay effect, that I made up last week and made a few videos of me performing with it (I made this for a future performance I&#39;m doing in Bordeaux early February)

https://youtu.be/QL05R3xbR9I


I&#39;m sharing this patch in the community patch library (in effects), and I want to say that I have shared quite a few of my patches used in my videos these last years, so don&#39;t hesitate in looking into them, changing them as you need/like (according to your #cc or GPIO) and having fun with them.
Some will probably need some wavetables files or other things, ask me if you need help, I&#39;ll try and be helpful (but leave me a few days)

              <p>well, i have figured it out, seems like just a ATTACK and DECAY envelope from the doesn't serve the task, as i still would like the gate to be open as long as the midi note is pressed, but with a smoother ATTACK and DECAY. will try my luck with ADSR then.</p>

              <p>hey mtyas and all others,</p>

<p>this is my entry into working with axoloty and has been the point that convinced me to get into it. thanks so much for your great video introduction to this as well, very clear and good to follow. even though there were some points still that remain a bit of a mystery to me. </p>

<p>i was wondering how it would be possible, to add a attack and decay envelope on the  REC, as well as on the ERASE gate?</p>

<p>BTW, that AKAI mixer you used, is it possible for Axoloti to switch the button LED's on/off on demand?</p>

              <p>Nice video, thanks for sharing. I especially like your gate tricks!<br>What you call "speed" I call "delay value" or "delay position" since it's really the position of the playhead (when you move it from 0 to 64 (63.5), you move the position of the playhead from 0 to your max delay value (5.46 s for your first delay), you know that, I'm just adding that for new users).</p>
