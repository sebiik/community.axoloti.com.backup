    <title>Syncing axoloti to Bpm from an audiofile? Bpm Analyzer?</title>

    <description>Hey :smile:

I am starting to build a patch for future livesets and have thought about different ways to incorporate Axoloti into that set up. One thing I think would be really nice to make is an Axoloti patch with sequencers that can be synced to for example an audio track played from a cd player(or whatever). I guess the main thing to make this happen is to build a Bpm analyzer than can analyze the incoming audio signals bpm and convert it into a midi clock signal(or similar?) to trigger the sequencers in Axoloti. This would kind of make &quot;regular&quot; midi clock unnecessary. 

Also in situations where midi clock is not really used as main sync source, for example if you want to use Axoloti to play sequences in sync with tracks that are being djed from cd players. This way you dont have to start and stop Axoloti sequences at the right moment manually, cause Axoloti would then sync to the signal feed from the dj mixer into Axolotis input.

Anyway going to research a bit how to do this, but if anyone has got an idea how to make a bpm analyzer, inputs are welcome ;)</description>

              <p>Well, </p>

<p>First I need to state that I´m no expert in the area whatsoever. But it isn´t as easy as one might think initially. Given that you have an audio source where you easily can tap the beat along to it: try figuring out <em>what</em> in that audio source you are actually following. Is it an separate instrument, or a 'composite' beat of several instruments together? Which frequencies are the main part of that beat/tempo?</p>

<p>And what is supposed to happen when there are no beat present (ambient audio)?</p>

<p>Maybe you´ll find something interesting here:<br><aside class="onebox whitelistedgeneric">
