    <title>Tempo synced envelope</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/tempo-synced-envelope/6224</link>
    <description>I&#39;m working on my sidechain ducking effect that is based on an inverted envelope. I would like to have it always synced to a quarter note, regardless of the tempo. 
So for example in 120bpm I have a time of 500ms, at 60bpm 1000ms  at 90bpm 750ms etc.

So as I understand I have to use the modulation inlet of and Env/d object, but I don&#39;t really understand how it is scaled. Does anybody know or have a different aproach for achieving this?

P.S. I have objects to measure the tempo (incoming midi clock) and spit out samples between the clock ticks.
So evntually I will have my quarter value in samples and I need to feed it into the lfo inlet.

P.P.S. Something like this object, but not as an lfo but only one time like and envelope would do the job.

<p>I also have an object measuring the samples between 24ppq and giving out an average length. </p>

<p>Im gonna try it out after the weekend <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">Ô∏è</p>

<p>I did an edit of the env/d a while ago. This one can be synced to any tempo.</p>

<p>To make it, I removed the mtof, midi to freq math and instead I fed it information from a timing to sample object, so the length of the envelope is based on sample data coming from calculating time between 16th notes. </p>

<p>Check the notes in the patch on how to change the envelope length(use the bitshifting object for that).</p>

<p>Anyway, here it is:<br><a class="attachment" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/a/ac7f9f478b67ab4d1f9f3e797694fd7a244b05df.axp">Sync Env Pulse 2.3 Blindsmyth.axp</a> (4.9 KB)</p>

<p>Should probably make it into a proper object at some point. To be continued........ <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
