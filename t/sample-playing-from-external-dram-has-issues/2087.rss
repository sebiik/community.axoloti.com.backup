    <title>Sample playing from external DRAM has issues</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/sample-playing-from-external-dram-has-issues/2087</link>
    <description>hi all, in order to make a piano sound i had to load samples in the external dram, but when i play them back, there is (what sound like a) buffer underrun.

this with the dsp load at less than 55%

it happens at random times, sometimes when playing one sample, sometimes when playing multiple, it is quite annoying for me.

i recorded the issue, which you can clearly hear at 0:11

i hope this will be tackled sometime.

p.s. this is what the sample loading/playback part looks like:

              <p>i am using 1.0.10 yes</p>

<p>the files are longer than the said buffer for each sample. (this could be an issue?)</p>

<p>i have it sometimes when loading other patches which don't use external DRAM as well.</p>

<p>this makes me think right now my axoloti software (pc) side is getting corrupt, so i'll replace that first before trying other methods.</p>

<p>i'll let you know!</p>

<p>edit: </p>

<p>reinstalling axoloti didn't work</p>

<p>the cyclecounter doesn't show a huge difference, except when i play multiple notes (which speaks for itself)</p>

<p>download to the patch is here: </p>

              <p>seems odd for a buffer under run, as the play is not doing a great deal....<br>are you using 1.0.10?  </p>

<p>one thing to be careful off, though probably not the issue is execution order , most of your midi and table/play objects are being executed before the mixer, I don't think this will have any effect, other than use the previous buffer, but always worth 'avoiding' these side effects.</p>

<p>also are the raw files all the full length of the buffer... </p>

<p>i think id try to narrow it down a bit, so its clearer what going on, in particular, perhaps you could sequence the notes, and see if this create a similar issue. It would be useful to remove the UI from the equation too... as this is sending data to axoloti which it needs to process.<br>(be careful with multiple notes, that you dont get distortion, so also consider turning patch saturation off)</p>

<p>also you could use patch/cyclecounter, to see how many cycles are being used... and if there is a large variance.<br>use max/min etc to track whats happening... depending where you place the cycle counts, you can measure different things,</p>

<p>sorry, hard to say anything really, as Id need the patch + samples... (its much quicker than having to generate my own, for a 'quick test', to play with ideas)</p>
