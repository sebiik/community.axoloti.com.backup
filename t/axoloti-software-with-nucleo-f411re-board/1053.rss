    <title>Axoloti software with Nucleo F411RE board</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/axoloti-software-with-nucleo-f411re-board/1053</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;m quite new to DIY synth, and the maker world, and I&#39;m wondering if I will be able to use Axoloti software with a Nucleo F411RE development board which has the STM32F4 microcontroller.  

I&#39;ve just ordered the Nucleo with the hopes of making a dedicated, stand-alone, midi controlled synth.  I would very much like to have the patching capability of the Axoloti software.  

The board does not have midi input hardware, so I am guessing I would have to try building the circuit using the same configuration as the Axoloti (from schematics).  Hopefully I can manage to figure that out without too much trouble.

Would it run natively with this board, or would there be a lot of work porting the code (which would be beyond my current capabilities).

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated,

              <p>I agree, the Axoloti would be great, but my goal is to learn more about circuit building and coding along the way.  I am looking for manageable challenges, as opposed to instant outcomes.  Currently I would describe myself as novice:  I understand the principles, but have limited experience implementing them.</p>

<p>At some point I will likely get an Axoloti Core to play with, but for now I think I will improve my skills with other builds (Goom, etc.) and then come back to this idea with a better understanding of the work involved.</p>

<p>Thanks again for your input.</p>

              <p>Hi Johannes, thank you very much for the quick and clear response.</p>

<p>Given the that most of the issues you mention are due to the lower capability of the F411, would it be feasible using a board with the F429 instead?</p>
