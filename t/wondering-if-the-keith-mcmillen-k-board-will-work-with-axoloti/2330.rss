    <title>Wondering if the keith mcmillen k board will work with Axoloti</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/wondering-if-the-keith-mcmillen-k-board-will-work-with-axoloti/2330</link>
    <description>Hello,  I&#39;m new to Axoloti and using Midi keyboards as well.

I am currently shopping for a small midi keyboard to use with Axoloti.  I have my eye on the Keith Mcmillen K Board,  which is similar to the Qunexus  but cheaper and with slightly less functionality.

I am wondering if anyone here knows if it will work with Axoloti?  I checked the list of verified USB midi keyboards on this forum and the Qunexus is on there... but not the K Board.  

Thanks</description>

              <p>I recently got one myself and it works. I did not do a lot of testing, but tried to display the velocity and pressure data. It works but getting roughly the same velocity values was harder then expected. The keys are really sensitive.</p>
