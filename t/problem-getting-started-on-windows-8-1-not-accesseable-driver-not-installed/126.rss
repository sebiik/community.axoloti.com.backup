    <title>Problem getting started on Windows 8.1 (&quot;not accesseable : driver not installed&quot;)</title>

    <description>Hy, just got my Axoloti today and so I want to play around with it now :smile:

I downloaded &amp; ran the installer, unzipped the runtime_bundle as described and then plugged in the board.

Images: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/co6i0h3ilzt2g8j/AAAzoiQSn8BZvwVHcM3FziF1a?dl=0 ( sorry for this, but the forum doesn&#39;t let my put individual image-links in here because i&#39;m a new user)

It seems to be installed fine: (see image 01)

However, in the Axoloti Application I cannot connect:
see images 02-03

I saw some fix via ZDiag in some other thread, however this seems fine to me already:
see image 04

Any hints? I&#39;m a little stuck</description>

              <p>You're close and it is really the same issue as in the other thread. Choose "install driver" in Zadig, not downgrade WCID or something else. Only boards that shipped before Monday suffer this firmware issue, and will not happen again after flashing. Sorry.</p>
