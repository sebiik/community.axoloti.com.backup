    <title>Can axoloti know that it&#39;s connected to a host?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/can-axoloti-know-that-its-connected-to-a-host/6591</link>
    <description>I have a patch that passes data from a midi controller through to my host, so I can use the same controller with ableton. However I also use the axo+patch without the host. However when not connected to the computer the patch crashes, propably it&#39;s a midi overflow.

So I&#39;m wondering if axoloti can detect somehow that it&#39;s connected to a host and if I could use that information in order to turn midi thru to the host on.</description>

              <p>I'm using the send midi from host solution.</p>

<p>But its at this point not only the buffer overflow. I use axoloti to control my rme ucx via midi. When no computer is attached I need to send a sysex message from axoloti to the interface to enable mackie control. When host is attached hower (to both interface and axoloti) it should stop sending this message. </p>

<p>Now I always have to have ableton send that note to axo that tells it that it's in host mode. But when I forget to send that note from ableton things are a bit fucked. It's not a huge problem but irriating for the least, that's why I'm asking.</p>

<p>But I guess this might be one of the things only high axoloti gurus such as <a class="mention" href="/u/johannes">@johannes</a> or <a class="mention" href="/u/thetechnobear">@thetechnobear</a> would know....</p>

              <p>I think I came across this myself at some point. It's as if when there's nothing to receive the message they get stuck in the buffer and it overflows or something. I didn't lose much sleep over it because I rarely connect to a host for midi. I don't know of any way of telling if the axo is connected to a host... </p>

<p>If a manual switch isn't wanted maybe you could set the switch to respond to incoming midi - if any midi messages are sent by the host, the thru is enabled. Not a very elegant way to work around it, but maybe it could work for you?</p>

<p>For having different midi setups I sometimes have a default 'patch switcher' patch as start up. So that loads and I have one button to load a patch set up for one midi source/destination, and another button to load the same patch but setup with different source/destinations.</p>

<p>I have some more troubles. I really need axoloti to know wether it's connected to a host or not. </p>

<p>Is there anyway to find this out?</p>
