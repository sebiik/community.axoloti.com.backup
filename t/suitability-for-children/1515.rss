    <title>Suitability for children?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/suitability-for-children/1515</link>
    <description>Does anyone have any experience of using the Axoloti Core for teaching with children or with children using it on their own? I have some friends who have children who are into synthesizers and wondering at what age people would recommend this as it could make a rather cool gift (with an enclosure)?</description>

              <p>Completely agree - I gave one to one of my children aged 12 and it's been a massive success, both MIDI mangling and audio manipulation.  Big success and thoroughly recommended.</p>

              <p>Thanks for your thoughts. The built-in speaker is an interesting feature. It's one the professionals are often puzzled over with some of the small stuff from Korg but I can see how this makes it more accessible/fun for children.</p>

<p>I've just ordered a few so it'll be interesting to see how they are received. I'll see if one of my colleagues who runs a <a href="http://codeclub.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">Code Club</a> can integrate it into a session. That's 9-11yr olds.</p>

              <p>Depends a lot on the kid and their interests, but I'd say 12 and up. Unless you give it with an enclosure with fun controls and a fixed patch already loaded, battery power and built in speaker, in which case it can be a fun musical toy for any age.</p>
