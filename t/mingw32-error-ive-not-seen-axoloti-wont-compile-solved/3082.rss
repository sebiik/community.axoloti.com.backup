    <title>Mingw32 error ive not seen, Axoloti wont compile [solved]</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/mingw32-error-ive-not-seen-axoloti-wont-compile-solved/3082</link>
    <description>Hi there, so yeah basically last night  was doing some work with the axo and everything was good. Then i got back home from uni and went to boot up the axo again and i get this odd error. Nothing has changed in terms of the patch as i just loaded my save from earlier in the day. i have also tried just loading a single factory object into the patcher and still the axo wont compile and brings up same error :(

.&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/e/ec705df9565a31444f5f793a73b88d854ced1f53.png&quot; width=&quot;484&quot; height=&quot;268&quot;&gt;

Any ideas as to what this means/how can i fix ? 
some more info, ive found out that these patches do compile &amp; run on my desktop machine, so must be something to do with my laptop. I went to re-install, hit the &quot;repair&quot; button as i&#39;m on the current release and that didn&#39;t change anything. 

Much appreciated</description>
