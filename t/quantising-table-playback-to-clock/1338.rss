    <title>Quantising Table Playback To Clock</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/quantising-table-playback-to-clock/1338</link>
    <description>I know this topic has poped up a couple of times here but I couldn&#39;t find an answer here and Ihave a specific aproach that I need help with:
I want to quantise the playback of a table to a clock, a master tempo. More concrete I want to Loop Audio and have the Loops playback in Sync with the master Tempo. To start with that I don&#39;t need to incorporate the possibility of tempo changes. 

My aproach is to first of all quantize the Record/Play button presses of the Looper Patch. Furthermore I count how long the loop is in clock ticks. What I want now is that the loop play is being retriggered after the amount of counted clock ticks. Unfortunately I am not able to change the value of the counter that retrigger acording to the counted loop length. Hard to explain, maybe just have look at my patch:

Thanks already, without the Input of this board I would have never gotten so far!

P.S. Ultimately I want to exchange the LFO with a midi clock but that is more a question dividing the midi clock output and setting the counters right, isnt it?

P.S. I am fully aware that this retriggering creates little ticks, it&#39;s no problem for now!</description>

              <p>Yeaha I just found the dynamic counter by Chaosmoon. <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/request-counter-with-dynamic-limit/766">http://community.axoloti.com/t/request-counter-with-dynamic-limit/766</a></p>

<p>This was the missing piece of the puzzle. This is a Looper that syncs to a clock. I have not implemented midi clock yet but theoretically it should work. If you want to change quantisation to 1 Bar for example you have to change the counter after the clock. I could be nice to have certain values ready and selectable with a mux. </p>

<p>P.S. It does not adapt to tempo changes yet, but that should be possible with using table read instead. Then You would get tape style pitch drop when slowing down,</p>
