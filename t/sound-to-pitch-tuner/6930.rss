    <title>Sound to pitch? tuner?</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/sound-to-pitch-tuner/6930</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not sure what you call that: Basically I was wondering if there is a module that can read the audio input, and output a pitch that can e.g. be patched to an oscillator. Or that you could use to determine tune a guitar that you have plugged in. is there something like that?

There was this  &quot;external signal processor&quot; in the korg MS20 that could be used to convert input audio to pitch CV. I know this is not easy (and sometimes impossible) to do if it needs to be fast and accurate, especially if you have distorted waves or even chords or noisy input.</description>

              <p>Yeah axo is capable. It took me a bit of tweaking to get the pitch tracking smooth over a decent range. If you need any help understanding what's going on in my (messy!) patch, just ask.</p>
