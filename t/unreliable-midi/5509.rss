    <title>Unreliable MIDI</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/unreliable-midi/5509</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using a Korg nanoPAD2 right now. The nanPAD2/Axo combination has worked normally in the past, but is now doing a weird thing:

1. You can _almost_ never play a note lower than the previous note. Sometimes you can!
1. It never seems to receive Note Off.
1. I can connect through another device (my MacBook Pro 2011, in this case) and then it works normally.

I&#39;ve definitely used MIDI devices before, but I&#39;m traveling and don&#39;t have access to another one right now to compare. I have two Axos on hand and haven&#39;t tried the other one yet, either, so I&#39;ll try that.

But: any idea why this might happen?</description>

              <p>After leaving it unplugged for a day and working on other projects, it now works again. But that's sort of disturbing, as I have a performance coming up. Any thoughts?</p>
