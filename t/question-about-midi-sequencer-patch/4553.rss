    <title>Question about midi sequencer patch</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/question-about-midi-sequencer-patch/4553</link>
    <description>Hello,

I&#39;m a new member here and started study to create some new patches. I&#39;ve built a patch for creating a midi sequencer. The midi out of the axoloti is going to midi in of my GRP A2 synth to create the sequence. The midi in of the axoloti is going to my midi controller, working fine also. I added some midi cc to lots of knobs and working fine as well. The midi out of the GRP A2 is going to the midi in of my akai mpc live as drumplayer. In my patch there is an object , midi out with a run knob and when I start, the akai mpc x is running on the beat, so far so good. At the same time the sequencer is working also well on the beat, BUT..... It randomise a little bit, sometimes, it is doing 2 pulses on the same step, sometimes not, it repeates on the same step but is going forward to the 16 steps. That is because there is also a tempo on the other object (seq_clk_sync). The problem is that I can not do a prefect step by step, it is always with some skipping, etc. The clocksource is on internal but when I change this to Midi, there is just the first pulse I hear and then doing nothing again, Is the Midi clock working ? If some one have better suggestions, let me know. Thanks Luc Debeck&lt;a class=&quot;attachment&quot; href=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/6/692ce85a3f2f5e03bfb33c972266e85bd6a5480b.axp&quot;&gt;seqencers_Midi .axp&lt;/a&gt; (8.3 KB)</description>

              <p>I found it. I had to put 16 gatelength levels and divider to it. It works perfect now</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
