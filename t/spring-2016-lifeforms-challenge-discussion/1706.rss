    <title>Spring 2016 - Lifeforms (challenge/discussion)</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/spring-2016-lifeforms-challenge-discussion/1706</link>
    <description>**Challenge:** dynamic/generative patches.

Create a patch that &quot;simulates&quot; an ecosystem, with one or several lifeforms interacting with each other. Of course the result should be audible, not necessarily musical or harmonious, but it should represent the current state of the ecosystem.

If you have no idea where to start, consider that you could break the problem down to a number of counter objects that represent the population (or use filter/integrator if you like math) and add/subtract units based on the current conditions (presence of food, competing organisms, deaths by age, etc)

**Submission window:** Yet to be defined, but expect it to be near the end of june

**Voting window:** Some days after submission

**Constraints:**

* Volume knob, clearly visible and on top of the patch
* Some parameters to edit the initial conditions of the patch and a reset button to restart the simulation

**Voting criteria:** Two polls will be created, one for the best patch art-wise, one for the best technique used (you should explain your patch if you aim to this award)


Good job and nice patching :D (also write something here if you intend to partecipate, you&#39;ll help the shy users come out of their shell!)</description>
