    <title>Every quarter midi note (software) to potential free contact GPO (hardware)</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/every-quarter-midi-note-software-to-potential-free-contact-gpo-hardware/1042</link>
    <description>Hi there - new to the Axoloti and new to the forum.

Could someone please shed some light on how to achieve the following:

**Every quarter note, a potential free contact shall be switched for a few milliseconds.**

Background: I&#39;d like to &quot;manually sync&quot; the play/record/stop commands of several Digitech Jammans to midi clock. The electric path could be serial, something like
&quot;tactswitch ==&gt; potential free switch (Axoloti, potential free contact, pulsed every quarter note) ==&gt; Jamman&#39;s footswitch contacts&quot;

The Jamman receives its signal, when both the tactswitch and the Axoloti are switched. For live usage, you would keep the tactswitch pressed slightly before the next quarter note and - bang - the Jammans were exactly synced. This would be great.

Still have to find out, whether the Jamman&#39;s footswitch is normally open or normally closed. 

So my questions are:
* Is this possible at all?
* Which Axoloti GPO would you use?
* I think, the output delivers +3.3 V (non-potential free). Could/would you apply a photomos-relais to translate the voltage into a potential free contact?
* What are the basic required patching objects?

Thanks in advance!

PS: If Axoloti could be a multitrack looper with track saving capabilities I would not think further about using the Jammans. ; )</description>

              <p>Connecting to a footswitch input of external gear:</p>

<p>I suggest building a little circuit around a FOD817 optocoupler (or similar). <br>I have not verified this circuit, this is only a suggestion:</p>

<p>On the primary side:<br>GPIO to a 220ohm resistor to optocoupler anode, optocoupler cathode to axoloti ground. <br>On the secondary side:<br>footswitch jack ground to optocoupler emitter<br>footswitch jack tip to optocoupler collector<br>This assumes that the jamman has a pullup resistor on the jack tip internally.</p>

<p>Normally open or normally closed can be compensated with a logic/inv in the patch - but that does not change behavior when the patch is not running. Some gear auto-senses normally-open versus normally-closed when you power it on (assuming pedals are not pressed during powerup).</p>

<p>SDCard streaming recording, long time ago I did some tests, small buffer read performance is acceptable, but small buffer write performance can be really terrible. It depends a lot on the specific card, I've seen (a)periodic drops in speed that would result in dropouts unless the buffersize is increased. Increased buffersize conflicts with low-latency streaming playback if used simultaneously. </p>

<p>Recording loops into tables is more practical than streaming. 43 sec @ 32bit, but also 86 sec @ 16bit is viable. Copying the contents of a table (in sdram) onto sdcard (not streaming): the table/save object has known issues when using it for other than very short tables, will look into resolving that in the near future.</p>

<p>the patching is relatively trivial , use midi/clock, if you search for 'clock' here you will get a lot of threads about this.</p>

<p>multitrack looper, from audio input...</p>

<p>would come down to memory limitations, there are some examples here of single track recording, so changing those to multiple is not an issue, if you are staying within a reasonable amount of SDRAM.<br>(43sec @ 32 bit) </p>

<p>streaming from the SD Card is supported by some objects but not writing to it... and Im not sure without a lot of work could be done efficiently = glitch free.</p>
