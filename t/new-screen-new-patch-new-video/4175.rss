    <title>New screen - new patch - new video</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/new-screen-new-patch-new-video/4175</link>
    <description>Hello hello
As some of you may have seen, thanks to @SmashedTransistors objects, some of us have been incorporating small OLED screens onto our axoloti boxes.
I&#39;ve just added one onto my ribbon synth, and adapted a few patches for it.
In this video, I have 8 table pitch objects associated with 8 prerecorded samples, that are looped with a slow LFO (modulated by the pitch). I then send these oscillators into a filter and then into one of 4 delay lines (my usual trick) and then all that into a reverb.
The screen is really useful for knowing which oscillator I have selected and that kind of information
Here is the result (sorry can&#39;t see the screen, stupid fArtistic camera man)

I have variations of this patch with different oscillators too, and with the screen, I can load up any patch without any silly fiddling, LED blink counting or small pieces of paper to help.</description>
