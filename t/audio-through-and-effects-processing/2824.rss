    <description>Hi All,
I&#39;m having real trouble using my Axo as an effects processor and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s down to stupidity.

I have a Behringer QA1622 mixer with all my synths going into it. My roland piano is my test source. From the aux send I have a short mono (balanced?) cable going to the Axo and the same going back from the Axo to the L channel of the Aux return. All good.

To test I&#39;m using the demo/youtube/multieffects patch but I get the same result with any patches really. If I try to send any more than 50% of my source into the Axo I get distortion coming back out. It appears that the signal is too hot. I&#39;ve tried the inconfig and outconfig objects, setting gains to -12db or 0db with no results. I simply can&#39;t get an audio signal fully into and out of the Axo without it crackling.

I admit I&#39;m pretty much clueless when it comes to signal strengths, db and that sort of thing.

Is there some basic rules around this? I&#39;ve noticed if I turn down my master AUX Send knob (which is a sum of all channels) and turn up the AUX return I can get more channel % sent without distortion.</description>

              <p>Okay thanks!</p>

<p>Since I don't notice any audio quality issues, I'll be going with a 6db gain before I return into the mixer.</p>

<p>For the second issue I mentioned (X:FX 50% dry / 50% wet): I'm pretty sure, the audio level dip is induced by the latency, since the output also sounds colored / phased. My workaround is to use only X:FX full down and full up, and then handle dry/wet within my patch.</p>

<p>Work in progress is now available at <a href="https://github.com/arisona/axoloti_rmx" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/arisona/axoloti_rmx</a> ... feel free to use it. It contains quite a bit of C++ code, since I prefer coding to patching (at the "micro level").</p>

<p>Comments are welcome!</p>

              <p>a)<br>Axolotis output is limited to around -12 db. after start is start saturating the signal but does not increase in volume to more than around -12 db. If you search the forum, you can find  debates about this subject. Can't offer you a technical explanation for it, some one else needs to do that <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> </p>

<p>And also dont hang me for the exact number cause its long time since I tested this stuff.</p>

<p>So why do you get the -6db drop?<br>I am thinking you might feed Axoloti with a signal that is louder than -12db. If you feed Axolotis in with a signal that is -6db, the output signal will be saturated to -12db, hence you loose the 6db.</p>

<p>Workaround:<br>If you got an audio interface with preamps, use them to compensate the 6db, simply + 6db on the preamp on Axolotis channel. And maybe also make sure you keep the input on Axoloti below -12db, so you dont get a saturated output signal.</p>

              <p>To re-animate this thread: I've read above posts re in/out dBs, but am not sure how this applies to my setup:</p>

<p>I'm using the Axoloti as external FX with my Xone 43C (<a href="http://www.allen-heath.com/media/AP9967_XONE_43C_USER_GUIDE.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.allen-heath.com/media/AP9967_XONE_43C_USER_GUIDE.pdf</a>). </p>

<p>Now, there are two issues: </p>

<p>a) Having a patch with straight audio through (i.e. stereo in -&gt; stereo out), I'm observing a drop of 6db (i.e. XFX knob full dry = original signal; full wet = signal 6db lower). Why do I get this 6db drop?</p>

<p>b) If I insert a gain of 6db, the full wet signal is equal to the full dry, as it should be. However, with 50% dry and 50% wet, the signal slightly drops. Not much, but audible. Where could this drop come from? Speculatively, I could think of two things: Either non-linearities in the AD/DA conversion from in to out, or a slight decrease due to the introduced latency of the Axoloti.</p>

<p>The mixer spec doesn't say a lot, except for the output levels for X:FX send: 0dBu (Norm) +20dBu (Max).</p>

<p>Besides that, it all works pretty well. I've implemented a fair amount of Live 10's new echo effect (with a spare UC-33 as controller), and I'll make it available as soon as it's finished.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

              <p>I imagine it would be tricky with the current hardware but if a new design is in the works, making it capable of doing this would be a HUGE improvement. Then you could really think of it like a smaller version of a KYMA which REQUIRES a user bought audio interface, and it starts at over $2000 a pop.</p>

It could offer multiple ins and outs too but of course that would require a bump in processing power and many other things. I am sure there is probably a new version in the works, advancements in technology as they are. The main body of the work is in the software side and though porting over to new hardware is not trivial by any means, it could be done and most patches and current modules could move over too.</p>

<p>However, I think there might be a market for a "Maxoloti" with, say, a 1GHz ARM, and +4dB signal level, to complement the Axoloti as an added product in the range.</p>

<p>Regards the problem with levels, are you aware of the seperate gain control object Axoloti has?  The one were you can stick it in the patch without connection and set the hardware gain levels?  If you were to use that, I can't imagine why you'd have any distortion problems.  Only recently I had distortion, but then I remembered that special object.  I can't remember the name of it exactly and can't check right now, but I'm pretty sure it was either under the Audio or Utility heading (most likely Audio).</p>

<p>Ok, well lets look at this logically - "Beat" Swing.</p>

<p>I see two aspects to beat swing; the beat, and the swing.  To create beat swing we therefore need an elegant way to extract the swing from a constant beat.  I would do this by taking a sinewave LFO, and putting it through a rectifier, therefore creating a function that can be used as swing (it would have the correct shape for swing).  This means our "swing" would be in full-force, and due to the simple yet elegant nature of this design, one only needs to lessen the amplitude of the sinewave to create less swing, as lessening amplitude creates a less pronounced function, and it is the <em>function</em> that is driving the tempo - therefore - the swing.</p>

              <p>Regarding audio through / effects processing via Axoloti.</p>

<p>I use mine with Mackie CR1604VLZ via Send/Return and can't say it is any worse than ensoniq dp/2 or jomox t-resonator, just another flavour/color in effects palette.</p>

<p>I use it also in live pa context with Octatrack via CUE OUTS -&gt; CD INPUTS in SEND/RETURN style too and did not notice anything bad with it.</p>

<p>And regarding abilities. I have also nord micromodular. You know - it has no memory even for decent delay line. Though it is still can be used for vast varieties of useful things. And i don't have any plans to part with mine.</p>

              <p>I'll add a comment for others who might be reading the start of this thread and then leaving with the view that Axoloti can't be used as an effect processor. I've had great success using Axo for FX by using it in line with my synth before going into the mixer. This avoids the level issues when using it as an FX send. Of course, I can only get one synth through it but it works great. Reverb, delays, bitcrush, sidechain compression. All these things are available and work well.</p>
