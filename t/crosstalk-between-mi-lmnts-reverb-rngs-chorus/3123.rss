    <title>Crosstalk between MI &quot;lmnts/reverb&quot; &amp; &quot;rngs/chorus&quot;</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/crosstalk-between-mi-lmnts-reverb-rngs-chorus/3123</link>
    <description>today i observed some kind of strange crosstalk between two of the MI models. i got some audio from the lmnts/reverb even if nothing was connected to its inputs, as long as the rngs/chorus had an input signal. i recreated the problem in a minimal setup and observed that this crosstalk only occurred if the chorus was placed after the reverb in execution order.

@thetechnobear: Maybe there are other crosstalk problems beside this special case? 

I really like the sound of both modules and even the crosstalk has some interesting characteristics. I just wanted to report this behavior.

              <p>I've noticed the same thing between rngs/ensemble and rngs/reverb. </p>

<p>I had an input going into rngs/ensemble. I cut the connection between that and rngs/reverb, which was the final object in my patch, so the reverb had no input at all, and I could still hear the input to ensemble coming out the reverb.</p>

<p>Are they sharing a buffer or something?</p>

              <p>I have also noticed that. That when for example loading 2 reverbs in the same patch it sounds very crazy.</p>

              <p>Thanks , coincidently I discovered the same thing yesterday between brds and lmnts.<br>It's going to either be a memory overrun or static buffer issue .<br> I'd guesss it's the latter probably as a result of the fact real MI modules only exist in isolation from one another . So yes , I think it's isolated to MI modules. </p>

<p>I'm refactoring all the MI code for the next release , so will investigate further during that.</p>
