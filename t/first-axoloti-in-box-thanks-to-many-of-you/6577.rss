Tadaaaam!
At last!
Finished (well... Maybe I&#39;ll open it again) my own &#39;holy g̶r̶a̶i̶n̶ grail&#39;, thanks to the contributions &amp; wise population of this forum.
100% done with solar power, oh yeah. 
As it was hard to select what to do, I didn&#39;t. So there are three modes : 
- 1st one taken from Johannes graintable, with a few options for continuous record, LFOs blablah
- 2nd (toughest to patch!) is a kind of enhanced Montreal Assembly&#39;s CT5 which I love but was frustrating me because of its fixed buffer size. So it&#39;s a 2 Factotum looper, with normal rec or BPM sync, and all the possibilities of the dear Factotum... (and again, LFOs and bells and whistles) 
- 3rd is around the clds. So obviously I couldn&#39;t put a lot more than the clds itself, still added some little bells and a few whistles.
The 3 patches have their pitch scalable on different tables, a clever idea which I unshamely took from the CT5 again. 
Finally, working the awkward aluminium box got more dusty and uneasy than my spaghetti patching... 


So thank you @johannes, @SirSickSik, @rbrt, @thetechnobear, @TheSlowGrowth, @Nosnibor, @MattilynMattroe, @SmashedTransistors, @jaffasplaffa  ... Etc</description>

<p>This time a smaller &amp; simpler "freeze" pedal that I built for artist Frédéric Le Junter.</p>

              <p>Thank you! I just had a (very shallow) look at the patches and played some guitar through them. They were a bit difficult to handle without footswitches, but they are quite helpful to me. I really like the graintable patch, it's like the gamechanger "audio plus" pedal a friend owns, but with more options. Must be a pretty cool pedal, are you going to make a demo of some sort?</p>
