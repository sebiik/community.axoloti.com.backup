    <title>Drseq... where does this bass pattern come from, really?</title>

    <description>Hi there,

Hope I won&#39;t bother with my wonders but... I&#39;ve spent some time today on the drseq.axp and I still cannot find what generates the notes of the Bass object...
I&#39;ve embedded most of the objects to end up suspecting there should be a kind of midi generator up above mix.mix_3... well, I can&#39;t find anythng in the objects midicode that could link to some notes patterns.... It&#39;s neither in table p.... 
( I must admit that I didn&#39;t at first intend to spend this first day on patcher on this .axp but I&#39;ve found it really interesting for my project, even if Jan&#39;s tutos prepared me to what I thought would be a simpler world :+1: )

Could someone be gentle enough to explain me which object generates these midi notes and help me get some sleep this night? .... Please? :slightly_smiling_face:

Thank you by advance for your time answering me ;)
