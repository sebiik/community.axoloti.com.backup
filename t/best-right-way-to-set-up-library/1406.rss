    <title>Best / right way to set up library</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/best-right-way-to-set-up-library/1406</link>
    <description>can someone explain or point me to the documentation that would explain the best way to set up the library on my hard rive. .  it doesnt seem to be working like it should.

i made a folder in user/documents  for axoloti and then a folder for my patches and a folder for patches that i download from here. .  but i cant seem to get them synced to the browser in axoloti.app. . even after setting the path in preferences.  . 

and i cant get my finder (osx 10.10) to recognise any axo files to open them in the app.  and since the  finder in axoloti is not very smooth (no recent folders / finder search) its a bit frustrating.  being able to sync my libraries into the axo browser would be great. 

thanks...</description>

              <p>have you watched this:<br></p><div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="PUMeb_tOTnY" data-youtube-title="Axoloti Libraries - Personal libraries" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>

<p>this is for 1.0.8 and above only, where libraries are introduced.</p>

<p>note: the video shows a private library which is synchronised to git, but if you just want it locally, then you simply need to create a library, with type 'local' and then select a directory for your library, and ensure you place 2 directories in it, one called patches, the other objects.</p>

<p>there is no 'patch browser', the object browser is for objects that are to be used within patches. (including sub patches (axs) ) , the intention is to introduce a patch browser, but as always finding time to do this  is proving 'challenging'</p>

<p>(... in fairness, I think this is a common misconception that patches are displayed in the object browser.. not quite sure why, I think perhaps wishful thinking <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> )</p>

<p>hopefully the community library will mean you don't have to do this. and will also mean that they are kept 'up to date'.</p>
