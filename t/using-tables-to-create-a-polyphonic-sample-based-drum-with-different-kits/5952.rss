Hi everyone! I´m developing a six voice polyphonic sample-based and piezo-triggered drum module. The idea is that you can change the complete 6 sounds (a &quot;kit&quot;) by using a button. It works like a charm using one table but as soon as I use a second one, either it goes mute or both samplers play the same file.
 The structure of filenames for each kit would be: 
kit 1:
000.raw
010.raw
020.raw
to 050.raw

kit 2:
001.raw
011.raw
021.raw
to 051.raw

and so on. 

In the first example, everything works great. I use both included buttons, one to change samples and the other to trigger them. In the second example, I have two tables, with different names and another digital pin to trigger the second sound but it triggers the same sound as the first table. I attach the files in raw in case anyone wants to try it.
Thanks a lot in advance</description>

              <p>Hi, Andrew, thanks for your advice in not using duplicated objects. I just didn´t noticed that. <br>Don´t know what happened in the first place but now the original patch I made works great!. You were right. <br>Here´s the patch.<a class="attachment" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/9/93622ac0cd0cf15ec63000c71283b7037bb4d9d9.axp">ludo-sample-drum.axp</a> (76.7 KB)<br>and a picture of the circuit:<br><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/9b9dbb3f096408d672ef9436f5df1cc344e68347" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9b9dbb3f096408d672ef9436f5df1cc344e68347.jpg" class="lightbox" title="IMG_20190821_154221048.jpg"><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/9/9b9dbb3f096408d672ef9436f5df1cc344e68347_1_690x388.jpg" width="690" height="388"><div class="meta">

</div></a></div><br>It has 6 channels, each of them with a 3.5" connector for the piezos, protected with 3.3V zener diodes and also with a 1M pull-dow resistor.<br>It also has a 10k  trimpot per channel for adjusting sensitivity and a led to show when a sample is triggered.<br>Finally a button for changing banks upwars cyclically (now working with only 3 but it can be easily change) and a potentiometer for the main volume.<br>As soon as I have time, I´ll design a pcb and ulpoad the schematics. <br>Hope this wlll be useful for some one else.</p>

              <p>Also in your patch you are doing +20 for the second sample, it should be +10 if you want the second sample to be 010.raw.<br>In your patch above it's going to look for 020.raw!</p>

              <p>Sorry I cannot download your samples (no permission for google drive).<br>Anyway your patch looks right at first sight,<br>The only weird thing I see is two objects 'GPIO in' for the same button...<br>You only need 1 GPIO button1 object, just connect it to both counter1 and counter2. <br>I hope this helps!</p>
