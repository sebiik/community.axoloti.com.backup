    <title>Embed Axoloti within existing MIDI hardware (sequencer, keyboard, controller)</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/embed-axoloti-within-existing-midi-hardware-sequencer-keyboard-controller/720</link>
    <description>As I wait for my Axoloti to arrive, my mind is running wild with the possibilities. One Idea I have is to physically add the Axoloti to my Yamaha RS7000. (Another, is to create a custom panel to house the Axoloti and the guts of an Evolution Uc-16 MIDI knob box.) In the example of the RS7000, I would like the Axoloti to be housed inside the case with only audio, usb and SD interfaces exposed.

My question is this, rather than run a MIDI cable from the external 5 pin DIN back into the Axoloti, is it possible to wire it directly to the MIDI connection INSIDE either device, while maintaining full MIDI functionality of the &quot;host&quot; sequencer/controller?

My thought was I&#39;d simply cut off the MIDI and power section of the PCB, and wire the Axoloti OUT to the corresponding IN inside the sequencer/controller case, and solder the Axoloti IN to the pins of the sequencer/controller out.

I&#39;ve done a little research, and it seems unlikely this simple solution will work. I&#39;d appreciate any feedback from people who&#39;ve attempted something like this, or even pointers to good resources for understanding MIDI hardware.

Thanks,

<p>There is an old unmaintained (sorry) patch that shows how to read/send MIDI on gpio in archive/tests/io/extra_midi_input.axh . But it will likely need some fixing before it works, as this was made long before release. I'd appreciate if a developer in the community could have a look at this.</p>

              <p>From what I've learned since posing the initial question, is that you cannot simply "splice" together MIDI signals. If you wire the output fro the keyboard directly to input of the Axo, you MIGHT get away with being able to connect an additional instrument. However, if you attempt to directly wire the input of the keyboard to the output of the axo, you will likely not be able to use the axo output.</p>

<p>Basically, you cannot simply merge MIDI information by wiring together a simple 1:1 splitter or merger. There are simple circuits online that could work, but I've not done too much research beyond discovering it likely won't work as simply as directly wiring in's to out's and vice versa.</p>

<p>Mainly what I am worried about is that the midi in on the axoloti would be wired to the midi in on another synth, but that very well might not even be a thing to worry about.</p>

<p>I'd recommend using one of those external powerbank batteries with usb output made to recharge a smartphone or tablet on the road. Even small ones should last several hours.</p>

              <p>Hi All,</p>

<p>I have a midi keyboard I picked up from goodwill that has 5 pin din midi out. I'd like to embed the Axoloti within this keyboard so it can run as a standalone synth, while retaining the original functionality of the midi keyboard.</p>

<p>I'm thinking all that I have to do is wire the midi out from the keyboard right to the midi in of the Axoloti. Do I need to do anything to protect the Axoloti from other things that I might plug into this midi keyboard, or is it fine to just solder the midi pins to each other?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>What I think would be very attractive for implanting is the Behringer BCR2000. Does anyone here have one and could check if there is space left inside?</p>

              <p>As I wait for my Axoloti to arrive, my mind is running wild with the possibilities. One Idea I have is to physically add the Axoloti to my Yamaha RS7000. (Another, is to create a custom panel to house the Axoloti and the guts of an Evolution Uc-16 MIDI knob box.) In the example of the RS7000, I would like the Axoloti to be housed inside the case with only audio, usb and SD interfaces exposed.</p>

<p>My question is this, rather than run a MIDI cable from the external 5 pin DIN back into the Axoloti, is it possible to wire it directly to the MIDI connection INSIDE either device, while maintaining full MIDI functionality of the "host" sequencer/controller?</p>

<p>My thought was I'd simply cut off the MIDI and power section of the PCB, and wire the Axoloti OUT to the corresponding IN inside the sequencer/controller case, and solder the Axoloti IN to the pins of the sequencer/controller out.</p>

<p>I've done a little research, and it seems unlikely this simple solution will work. I'd appreciate any feedback from people who've attempted something like this, or even pointers to good resources for understanding MIDI hardware.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br>-ry</p>
