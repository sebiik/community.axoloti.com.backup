    <title>Patch changing from MIDI Program Change (help)</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/patch-changing-from-midi-program-change-help/4110</link>
    <description>I realise that there are other threads detailing this feature, but they are all quite old. Apologies for the new one...

I&#39;ve been trying to follow keyman&#39;s instructions in [this post](http://community.axoloti.com/t/patch-bank-and-midi-program-change/1078/3) for a simple program change to SD card patch implementation but I&#39;m having no luck.

I&#39;ve so far done the following:

1. Made &#39;patch_loader.axp&#39; which sits in my root patches folder (note that I&#39;ve changed it from the default My Documents location)

2. Set &#39;patch_loader&#39; in the Controller Object

3. Created a sine osc and a square osc patch. These are patch ID 0 and 1 respectively.

4. Uploaded a patch bank with the two osc patches.

5. Uploaded the sine osc patch as the start-up patch.

6. Disconnected the Axoloti, booted it in standalone and sent it program change messages.

7. Floundered.

I&#39;ve got a midi led activity monitor in the sine_osc start-up patch, so I can see it receiving program control messages correctly, but it&#39;s not switching to the 2nd patch.

The patches, settings, SD card and local patches folders are shown in the image below:

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4c833e427d06e5cd1dd14c426c0d6850234705ef.png&quot; width=&quot;517&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;

I&#39;ve also tried putting the patch_loader objects inside the two osc patches, to see if the problem was with the Controller Object not finding patch_loader.axp. That didn&#39;t work either.

If anyone&#39;s got any suggestions it&#39;d be grand. I&#39;ve trawled through the forums but can&#39;t find a definitive, best-practice implementation. This looked like the easiest approach to me.

Unless I&#39;m going crazy I also couldn&#39;t find anything on this the User Guide, which is a shame because it seems it&#39;s one of the best and most important features of the Axoloti. It&#39;d certainly save new users from trawling through old forum threads, many of which are using old versions of the editor.
