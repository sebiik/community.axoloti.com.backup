    <title>Constant crashing - I don&#39;t think that&#39;s normal</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/constant-crashing-i-dont-think-thats-normal/3902</link>
    <description>I bought my Axoloti about a year ago and never really got into it mainly because it crashes without any rhyme or reason. Sometimes I can use it for several minutes before it needs a power cycle, other times it only lasts a few seconds. Doesn&#39;t matter if the patch is simple or complex. CPU use can be very low, or high. What can I do?</description>

<p>Here is the patch. it's supposed to be an synthetic wah effect for my guitar. (I'm also happy about improvement suggestions <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> )</p>

              <p>best to post the patch in question and see if others can reproduce. do you use any non factory objects? maybe one of them has a bug?</p>

              <p>Hello,<br>I'm quite happy with my axoloti but I recently also got some "crashing" issues.<br>Let me describe what happens:<br>I can run patches while being connected to my PC or standalone from the SD card. Everything works fine but after some minutes the signal distorts and than dies. Changing the patch (or reloading) brings back the signal.<br>There are no error messages in the log.<br>Any idea what could go wrong here?<br>Thanks a lot!</p>

              <p>its certainly is not normal... if there users were seeing it as being unstable, there would (rightly <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">) be a huge number of complaints here...</p>

<p>but your gonna have to supply a bit more information than just that 'it crashes'... <br>what we need to determine is why your system is different from others, so we need to know exactly what you have setup, and how you are using it.</p>

<ul>
<li>what do you mean by crashing? the editor? the patches?</li>
<li>what OS are you using?</li>
<li>have you installed the latest version of the Axoloti software?</li>
<li>are you using an SD card?</li>
<li>tried different usb cables?</li>
<li>are any errors shown in the axoloti console?</li>
</ul>

<p>( you should be using the release version of 1.0.12) </p>

<p>also please, go an re-read the installation instructions and also the troubleshooting posts, in the user-guide section... perhaps this might given you an idea of where the issue may be.</p>

<p>without the above, hard to say whats going on, but given your saying its running for a few minutes...<br>one important thing for us to determine is, is the hardware crashing, or is it just disconnecting from the editor <br>(something many users , still attribute to it 'crashing', but its not really) </p>

<p>so try a few things...<br>create a simple patch which outputs a constant sine wave, keep this running... does it disconnect from the editor? if it does, do you still here the sine wave? (i.e. is the patch still running on the hardware, despite the editor disconnecting)</p>

<p>also try setting this as a startup patch, see if it works without the editor</p>
