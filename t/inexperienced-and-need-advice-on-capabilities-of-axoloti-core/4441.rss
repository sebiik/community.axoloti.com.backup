    <title>Inexperienced, and need advice on capabilities of Axoloti core</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/inexperienced-and-need-advice-on-capabilities-of-axoloti-core/4441</link>
    <description>I am working on a project that uses lasers to trigger midi notes. I would like a physical switch that selects between different instruments, and two other physical switches that can change the parameters of the sound, e.g  attack, release. I would like the project to have a built in speaker, but have the option of switching to external speakers, anyone know if I can achieve these things with the Axoloti? Thanks in advance!</description>

              <p>Hi, thanks for response! I intend to use a physical 3 way switch to select instrument. As for the sound parameters I was hoping that these could be some sort of slider? so that they can be controlled "live" as it were. Do you know of any similar pojects that I could have a look at?</p>

              <p>all of this can be done easily but you will need a little amp for the "internal" speaker. (can be a 5v integrated amp powered by axo)<br>also, what do you mean by "switch"?.  a two position switch? / momentary? , still, yes, it can be done.</p>
