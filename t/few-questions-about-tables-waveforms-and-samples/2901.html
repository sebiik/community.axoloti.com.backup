        <p>Im trying to make a synth that has multiple waveforms and few samples played at the same time. Some times when I  rename a table with another name than T1  I get errors.  Also when upload the samples to sdcard the patch seem to work fine and it plays the samples fine,  after a few minutes the console tells that the sample can't be found.  Im using wave/play/pitch because I need the pitch.  These have happened many times now.  Any Ideas?  Thanks in advance. </p>

<p>Edit: <br>And also the waveforms pitching seem to stop when playing up high notes so it plays just the same note.</p>

        <p>Do you have a picture of your patch?<br>You have to name the table according to your memory allocation!!<br>I also work a lot with samples.<br>You should know that Axoloti searches the samples on the SD card in a specified folder.<br>If you are working with your Axo connected to your computer and you go live with a patch named 'untitled' it searches for the sample on the location SDCARD/untitled/ If you upload the patch on the SDcard as starup, it will search the samples on the ROOT of the SDcard, and NOT in /untitled/<br>I have no issues with not finding samples...</p>

<p>On the other hand I also can't wrap my head around why the wave/play/pitch object doesn't want to pitch samples higher than +32... I also posted a thread about this, but so far no solution. Maybe we still do something wrong <img src="https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> <br>Anyway hope the above helps you, otherwise post your patch, maybe I can help you out.</p>

<p>greetings,</p>

        <p>Yesss,  got it working.  I guess most of the problems occurred just because me not knowing enough stuff :).  The high notes not playing problem is solved also by syncing libraries.  Awesome.  I also replaced my waveform play objects using phasor/compl and table/play.  Im still not sure what the phasor/compl is but it plays waveforms very clearly compared to my earlier solution which sounded actually kinda awful. </p>

<p>Im making a patch that has drum machine and also a playable synth.  Im wondering how could I make the synth bump  a bit with the drumkick like when compressed.  I tried all the compressors but didnt get the sound Im looking for yet.</p>
