        <p>Yeah, I agree I think this is going around in circles...</p>

<p>my proposal is pretty simple: </p>

<ul>
<li>axoloti UI which gives simple use interaction.</li>
<li>git (or similar VCS with local store) to manage different versions of objects.</li>
<li>patches store commit id... </li>
<li>users usually use latest commits. but will be notified if there local repo is not at HEAD.<br>(again I repeat, this is NOT how it will appear to the user)</li>
</ul>

<p>Im even tempted to say, that a patch is seen as one entity, i.e. you can load it with a given commit id (ok, one per repo), <br>you cannot load it with way some objects from one date and others from another date.<br>we could even allow users to 'checkpoint' a patch i.e. put tags, such that they know its in a particular saved state for a performance/recording. <br>this approach means dependancy is a non-issue... if it worked at commit id 12419487 , then all objects/sub-objects from the repo will be the same.</p>

<p>my only aim (at this stage) is versioning...  I recognise packaging may be a 'feature request' but I don't believe it has the same priority as supply a 'user library'.</p>

<p>I'll also point out, I don't really even think versioning is an issue currently (or a priority), I merely suggested github as a storage service, that happens to also help us with versioning.</p>

<p>pros<br>- free, reliable, well understood technology.<br>- supports local caching and full versioning feature set<br>- APIs to allow to be embedded within application.<br>- wide range of tools available to 'power users' to resolve issues, and help manage library<br>- version/change history available to users.</p>

<p>cons<br>- need to possibly adapt our thinking<br>- doesn't cover dependency management between 'fine grained' objects.<br>- need to be careful to not expose git to end-users<br>- contributors (not other users) need to be registered with gitub<br>- simultaneous editing possible, but really we don't want to get into merge/stashing with users, avoidable with correct workflow features. (note: other solutions may also stumble on this) </p>

<p><a class="mention" href="../../users/alex.html">@alex</a>, no collecting in ableton is more about taking copies of resources, so able to move/know the don't change... it just puts in a single directory, from there you can zip/tar do whatever you want.<br>I see combining objects as packaging, and not linked to versioning</p>
