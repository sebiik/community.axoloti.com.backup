    <description>I did see the topic on how to code for axoloti objects but I was totally lost on the terminology, as I really know literally nothing about coding. I can design analog eurorack modules on my protoboard, so I&#39;m not dumb ;) Should I learn C? XML? csound? . It would be awesome if somebody linked me to step by step progressive learning stages, as I do intend on creating my own objects eventually.</description>

              <p>Cool, thanks guys. I'm quickly becoming quite familiar with patching in Axo, as a hardware modular designer/builder/user it is very intuitive to me. I will follow your suggested steps. I think the toughest for me will be the maths, even the wiki definition you linked is a bit cryptic for me, but I'll learn. Particularly what field of maths should I study for filter design and such? Calculus? Trig? All of it? Lol. Anyways, thanks again, and I'll be seeing you in the new coding section!</p>

              <p>steps id suggest</p>

<p>a) ensure your very familiar with patching axoloti<br>b) learn some basic C  (lots of resources on the internet)<br>c) read a up on the basics of DSP, if your not familiar with it (http://www.dspguide.com/pdfbook.htm)</p>

<p>you can then start basic object creation with the object editor in Axoloti. (xml is not need initially)</p>

<p>obviously, baby steps, don't try anything too adventurous....</p>

<p>you can take a look at how existing objects are created as inspiration for your objects, or even as a starting point.</p>

<p>one thing that can be confusing is for efficiency , we use integer fixed point maths...<br>so you need good familiarity with Q Maths<br><aside class="onebox wikipedia">

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(number_format)">Q (number format)</a></h3>

<p>Q is a fixed point number format where the number of fractional bits (and optionally the number of integer bits) is specified. For example, a Q15 number has 15 fractional bits; a Q1.14 number has 1 integer bit and 14 fractional bits. Q format is often used in hardware that does not have a floating-point unit and in applications that require constant resolution.   Q format numbers are notionally fixed point numbers, that is, they are stored and operated upon as regular binary signed integers, thus...</p>

</p>

<p>for exporing DSP, you might initially also want to look for some Max/Pure data tutorials.</p>

<p>Just bare in mind, your dealing with a new language (C), a new environment... and if your not familiar with DSP programming, a new subject area... so it takes time, but its fun to make things go beep <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>also be warned, DSP programming is pretty maths intensive, so depending on your skills in this area, then you may want to avoid things like filters, reverbs etc <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=0" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>many = 2 people ... (or have i missed it, and its 3?) </p>

<p>anyway, Ive created here:<br><a href="//community.axoloti.com/c/axoobject-code" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://community.axoloti.com/c/axoobject-code</a></p>

<p>BUT... as I said when discussed before, Im not convinced its a topic that will get many posts... but lets give it a try, if its goes too off-topic, or doesnt attract enough posts, I'll merge them back into software, and delete the category</p>

<p>Many have asked for this and wants this in here. Or at least a category where we "noobs" can discuss object coding with each other. We asked for a "coders" category, but developer doesnt seem interested in that. But I guess the more people asking for it, the more likely it is we get one eventually. </p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> would you consider creating this category? If you are worried that it will bring you a lot of ekstra explaining, you could put a disclaimer saying that the developer doesnt participate in that specific category. It is just important that the information is easy to find.</p>
