              <p>Some random thoughts on VCV: I built it from source the other night on Linux and have been impressed so far. JACK support isn't compiled in by default but works great if you follow the instructions on the wiki. The plugin ecosystem is still in its earliest stages. There is this confusing sort of 'login' mechanism (both on the website and in the app) which seems to be laying the foundation for commercial plugin sales; you're not required to use any of it right now. In fact, if you build the bleeding edge sources in their default state, it is disabled.</p>

<p>I found that many of the available plugins are broken against the bleeding edge development version (annoyingly). Each plugin maintains its own version number which I think is supposed to track the overall release version number (Rack is currently at 0.5.1 and plugins seem to be at 0.5.x). The claim is made that all 0.x plugins are compatible which 0.x releases but it seems like backwards compatibility breaking changes are being made. Hopefully there will be a better strategy for dealing with plugin API level in the future.</p>

<p>The UI is the most impressive part of VCV to me. It is extremely responsive and smooth on my development machine, but might be too expensive for lower-end machines. It seems like considerable effort has gone into making the modules look pretty. I'm not totally sure how I feel about the "realistic" studio rack UI metaphor. There is nothing that feels like a real programming language here, no abstraction mechanism. You are purely using modules with their pre-fab UIs. It all looks super pretty though and feels very approachable, simple. Like you are just sitting down at a physical device that "just works", not having to deal with much software complexity. I think this last aspect is something we could improve on in Axoloti, making the experience for streamlined for new users, particularly less technically inclined ones. What's interesting about the UI implementation is that it is not using JUCE or QT or Java or any other very heavy UI library; it's using GLFW which is pretty close to raw OpenGL but helps out with normal UI stuff like input and events, etc. It's definitely inspiring me to think about directions for future Axoloti UIs. It might interesting to have a system that had the ability to work with both more abstract object representations (like Axoloti currently) and pre-fab skeuomorphic modules (like VCV) at the same time. I guess this is kind of like Reaktor maybe?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the actual sound hasn't impressed me that much so far, but I haven't had a chance to go through all the modules.</p>

<p>Yes, true. I heard an interview with Andrew Belt, the VCV Rack creator and he mentioned that they hadnt looked into optimization yet. So hopefully the side of it will become better in the near future <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>Someone tipped me, that I shoud try lowering the screen resolution of my Macbook. And this actually seems to do a difference, it take a little bit longer before the computer gets hot and fan goes crazy.</p>

<p>Yeah, I have promised my self never to buy any Eurorack all though I have been tempted many times.

<p>I have installed developer version and have all ready made a few objects for its. Its a bit more complicated than Axo , but in general not too hard, once you got the development environment set up. Especially not when working with logic stuff like sequencers etc. But high quality osc's and stuff like that I am still learning about. That gets a bit complicated.</p>

Was also pretty nice.</p>

<p>The VCV Rack is actually not a VSTI, it's a stand alone application, with some build in modules. Though I got it set up using IAC/Soundflower driver so I can trigger it with midinotes form Logic, without to much latency.</p>

<p>But, like Axoloti it's completely open source and I am finding lots of new stuff every day on Github.</p>

<p>Yep, that is my experience too. My fan on my 2012 Macbook, is almost blowing full speed form the second I start adding modules to the rack and my computer get really hot. </p>

<p>And there is also pretty good guides on ho to build your own modules. Going to try in a few days, I think.</p>

<p>I only tried it twice with other stuff, but it never worked either time.

<p>As with Mark, I'm interested in the performance too, cause while the Pi3 isn't exactly a powerhouse, it still might make a nice little standalone gadget even if it could only handle a small amount of modules.</p>

<p>we are <strong>not</strong> minimising the importance of these types of discussion, rather saying there are better places to have them... places where users go to read/discuss them.</p>

<p>guidelines:<br>- posts which branch off into meta or political discussions, offensive language, name calling, will be removed<br>- moderators posts are not 'up for discussion' - if you want to discuss them , do this via PM with <a class="mention" href="/u/johannes">@Johannes</a> and myself<br>- if you find a post offensive, report it do <strong>not</strong> respond to it. (we do not care 'who started it!')<br>- also we don't want to spend large amounts of time moderating (rather developing), so if a topic goes off-course, we will just remove it from the start, taking good n' bad posts alike.<br>- repeat offenders will be given a 'timeout'</p>

<p>I'm with you on this, though I don't see it as big of a problem.</p>

<p>I'm sure you can edit that out of the software and implement your own way of adding the extension modules (they are open as well, so really only the installation mechanism is what you need that password for). So, just go ahead and make your own fork of the software. I'm sure you can use a git repo or some other free cloud storage thing as a software repository to add a simple "package manager" in the spirit of linux. Or, just make debain packages for the vcv rack and each of its extensions. Its all open, there is nothing stopping anyone, which I think is great!</p>

<p>It uses openGL and other standard cross platform libraries which I also really like.</p>

<p>From the look of it building new modules seems as simple as taking an existing fundamental one and editing it and adding it to the list of fundamental objects. Nice.</p>

              <p>yeah, its getting a lot of attention, with mostly very positive feedback. <br>(SonicTalk featured it yesterday, and they were heaping lots of praise on it) </p>

<p>Im actually quite interested in it due to the code they have open sourced.</p>

<p>I also read the 'open source' tag line a little different , many basically read open source = free.</p>

<p>But I dont, and I dont think thats what VCV is either... I think VCV rack has a different 'dream'.<br>I think the idea is, because its open source, ANY developer can create new modules for it... its an open API.</p>

<p>This I think is much more interesting ... to have virtual modulars take off in way similar to eurorack, we need:<br>- an API, similar to VST, that is free, and available to any developer(big or small) to build new modules.<br>- an API, allows developers to potentially develop other HOSTs (again like VSTs) <br>- the API, needs to not be 'owned' by a company (as other companies don't like this much) </p>

<p>I think this is what VCV meant by it being open source,  the rack and modules are just implementations, but they can be taken in other directions by others... alternative implementations. </p>

<p>sure this is perhaps not interesting to any one except developers <strong>until</strong> 3rd party developers starting adopting and create additional modules or rack implementations ... thats when users get the pay-off.</p>

<p>of course, that may not happen, again the nature of open source, 1000's of proposals/idea, and only a few stick, perhaps this will be successful, or perhaps it will just inspire something that will be 'the thing'</p>

<p>... this IS the spirit of open source, its not about free, its about sharing, its about allowing software/hardware to live in alternative forms, even if the original developer becomes uninterested. the software has its own life.</p>
