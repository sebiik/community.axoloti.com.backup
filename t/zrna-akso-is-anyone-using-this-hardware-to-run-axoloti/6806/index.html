        <p>Yes that's what it is, a more powerful version of Axoloti. About 4 times as powerful on most parameters.</p>

<p>It's developed by <a class="mention" href="/u/urklang">@urklang</a></p>

<p>I also got a Daisy Seed board here <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>Pretty cool thing, but a bit harder to program, for me at least. I don't know a lot about memory allocation and things like that, for reverbs and delays, for example. Waiting eagerly for some time so I can try out the PD &gt; Daisy script. I am kind of depending on that, since I still lack some knowledge on the c++ regarding more advanced stuff.</p>

<p>And just ordered a Blokas PiSound to finally finish my Pi/Pd box <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>So lots of project here and also working full time atm. 24 hours a day is just not enough <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> </p>

<p>Might have to get an Akso next month, hehe <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

        <p>I am also in the club. Ordered a Daisy Pod in July. "Only" took 4 weeks to travel from California to Frankfurt (I don't know why it has been in Chicago for 3.5 weeks, but I guess it was because of the pandemic). Then within one day it arrived in Vienna. There it has been at the customes office ("Zoll") for 10 days (I guess the officers there have never seen a Daisy Pod). After paying ~25 EUR customs tax it was finally mine. Now I built a wooden enclosure and connected an OLED via SPI, yeah! Communication with the electro-smiths was nice, also is their forum. Daisy and libdaisy make fun (I am used to C++, though it has been a while).<br>After this success (good training for patience) I ordered an AKSO. I guess it arrives "sooner" <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> <br>We will see...it is a pity summer is over and so is my free time.</p>

Comunication with the maker isnt best also , last mail he sent me was 1 month ago and since then silence ....<br>I would love to hear if other folks experienced this and if they are running theirs at all , cause even the forum is not so crowded</p>

        <p>Hello sorry for your trouble with this,</p>

<p>I ordered mine on like you in July and received the unit in the UK on the 8th of October, I had to pay a customs charge to the royal mail they informed me via a card through my door and I was able to pay the charge and arrange delivery online.</p>

<p>users ivofx, hwk, Blindsmyth and Rbrt I believe are all based in Germany and received their units, all had some issues with Frankfurt. To put your mind at ease units have been shipped out and received.</p>

<p>The others received a notification of a customs charge similar to the one I received, I know that you have not. Is there a way of contacting the customs agency in Frankfurt directly? Or maybe send a message to any of these users asking them to explain if the had to do anything extra.......</p>

<p>hope it arrives on your doorstep this morning. <br>He is just one man and yours appears to be an issue in transit in that the goods have been sent, just not received, but counter to that he has issued a refund to someone in the past 8 days after they posted on the forum asking for one and has been quite transparent that circumstances, change of city and job during Covid have impacted Akso</p>

<p>Hey my two boards ordered in july didn't arrive either. One bounced back because it had arrived when I visited my parents, when I saw the notification that it was at a post office it was already too late and the sent it back. The other one ist stuck in Frankfurt since 31.october...</p>

<p>But as far as I know the software is still buggy and many patches won't work. I checked with <a class="mention" href="/u/rbrt">@rbrt</a> who has received his board already to see what is not working. In this state it's basically useless for me, so it doesn't matter to much if it's lying around here ot at customs.</p>

<p>EDIT: sorry I hope this doesn't sound too cynical here. I do respect nics work here and understand it's not his main source of income but I think shipment could be improved drastically here, waiting 6months for this thing and then not having sufficient tracking is really bad.</p>

<p>there are issues, yes..some are described here: <a href="https://github.com/zrna-research/akso/issues" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/zrna-research/akso/issues</a><br>nothing that couldn't be fixed, but <a class="mention" href="/u/urklang">@urklang</a> would be the one to <br>do this most efficiently I think...but AFAIK he's all wound up at the time being <br>in trying to organize / get along...which I can perfectly understand</p>

        <p>Finally got my board this last week.  In the meantime my main Mac has become my DTK (Apple Silicon) so I think I'll have to use an older Mac as my Axoloti machine and to experiment with this new board.</p>

<p>I did get the board connected on Apple Silicon, but the patch won't compile just yet.  The install was very easy and nice as everything is packaged together, a very nice experience for initial setup.</p>

        <p>Guess we'll have to wait for Axoloti to run on Apple Silicon. Not sure if the compilation toolchain is already ported to support the new processors, and if any changes to the Axoloti patcher are needed.</p>

        <p>I don't have any Macs with Apple Silicon, but Rosetta 2 should be able to run Intel apps. I'd look a bit closer at WHY the patch won't compile.</p>
