    <title>Polyphony question... passing voices through midi</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/polyphony-question-passing-voices-through-midi/917</link>
    <description>Hello everyone... 
  I am still very new to the community and have a few questions. first off is there a manual anywhere that I just totally missed because that would be helpful. second I&#39;m trying to figure out if what I&#39;d like to do is possible. I would like to create a 3 voice polyphonic patch, voice 1 will go out through dac 2 and audio out left, voice 2 through dac 2 and audio left and voice 3 will get passed out through midi. would I want 3 mono with bypass subpatches? I&#39;m not sure...</description>

              <p>I'm having trouble understanding how I can use the polyindex to route as I said.<br>I figured out how to use a demux wikth the patch/polyindex object to route the the subpatch out of left or right which works great. I'm still working on figuring out how to essentially bypass the subpatch for voice 3 and just route out the midi data. I didn't understand what you mean by the audio outputs are summed across voices but things seem to be working fine. I haven't tried DAC outs which will be used for triggers, gates envelopes etc. (I'm still waiting for parts in the mail)</p>

              <p>the 'manual' is online<br><a href="//community.axoloti.com/c/user-guide" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://community.axoloti.com/c/user-guide</a></p>

<p>also, Id recommend you look at the tutorial patches, and the help patches, they contain alot of useful information</p>

<p>so you want </p>

<p>V1 - &gt; audio out  left <br>V2 - &gt; audio out  right (i assume typo in your desc as otherwise its just both to audio left)<br>V3 -&gt; midi output.</p>

<p>easy enough, you just need to use patch/polyindex</p>

<p>then conditionally you can sent to audio/out/left right or midi/out </p>

<p>bare in mind audio outputs are summed across voices, so you can output zero on the audio outs for voices that dont contribute to the audio.</p>
