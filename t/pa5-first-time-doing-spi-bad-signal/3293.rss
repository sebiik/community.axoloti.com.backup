    <title>PA5. First time doing SPI. Bad signal?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/pa5-first-time-doing-spi-bad-signal/3293</link>
    <description>Trying to use some of the patches here, which clearly work for others:
http://community.axoloti.com/t/gpio-i-o-example-74hc595-shift-register-spi/131

But doesn&#39;t for me. At all. I&#39;ve loaded the patch and the only connections I have to the board (aside from usb) are PA5 and GND, which are connected to my oscope. The signal looks like noise with an occasional spike;  I would expect this to be a clock signal (i.e. regular square wave). Am I missing something?

This is literally the first time I&#39;ve tried to do something outside the demo patches in axoloti, so I&#39;m hoping I&#39;m just doing something stupid.</description>

    Hi everyone, at the moment, I'm trying some ICs with axoloti and want to share my results. It maybe helps someone and we can learn from each other. 

Patch Description: Two shift registers are connected to axoloti's SPI. The single outputs (Q0â€¦Q7) of the 595s are gated by a simple step sequencer. Check the script object for more details.
