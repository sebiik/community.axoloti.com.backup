    <title>What do do with the din/power section? Can it be repurposed?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/what-do-do-with-the-din-power-section-can-it-be-repurposed/5940</link>
    <description>Hi guys,

I&#39;m working on a project that didn&#39;t require the din connectors so I cut the section off.  Has anyone reused that section in its entirety?  Any ideas on what to do with it?

Thanks
