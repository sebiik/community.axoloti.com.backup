    <title>Axoloti intro &amp; workshop at Forum Lenteng, Jakarta</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/axoloti-intro-workshop-at-forum-lenteng-jakarta/6152</link>
    <description>I will give an introduction to Axoloti to the art collective Forum Lenteng (https://forumlenteng.org/en/) in Jakarta on 13th November. They might use the Axoloti already for their upcoming event at Goethe Institut in Jakarta in the 69 Performance Club series; the next edition will concentrate on the use of sound in performance art.

I&#39;ll do the intro in two parts and let them play with the Axoloti and some electronic components between and after. The aim is to give them a basic understanding of what Axoloti can be used for and what not. Then it&#39;s up to them to decide if and how they want to use it of course. 

Topics will include:
PART 1: Basic Synth &amp; Controls
- Basic synth: oscillator - envelope - filter + MIDI controller input
- Analog GPIO: potentiometer, switches, light sensor
- Simple sequencer

PART 2: Samples, Loops &amp; Effects
- single track looper for mic (audio) input
- drum machine with pre-recorded samples in .raw format
- effects: tremolo with LFO, panning with LFO, delay &amp; echo, reverb, pitch-shifter, etc.

Their greatest interest goes out to the second part; the first part is more a vehicle to demonstrate some basic possibilities. However, the topics I address there are very very basic, since sampling is not really my area. I&#39;m looking for other interesting techniques for sample manipulation now. If anyone has a nice idea or is willing to share an impressive patch that can be used with mic input, that would be very welcome, even after the date of the intro here.
