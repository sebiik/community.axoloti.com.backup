    <title>Noisering patch</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/noisering-patch/2609</link>
    <description>I want to share this subpatch with you all. It is an emulation of the Noisering by Grant Richter (available in Eurorack from Malekko Heavy Industry). It uses an 8 bit shift register that gets translated to a voltage (or in our case a 0-255 integer.) The bits get cycled through one step at a time, and the last bit has the possibility of being changed depending on the settings. The &quot;change&quot; knob controls the likelihood that the bit will be changed, and the &quot;chance&quot; knob controls how likely it is to become a 1 or a 0. You just have to give it some kind of clock or trigger input.

Check it out and have fun!
