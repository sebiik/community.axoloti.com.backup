    <title>Midi in - I&#39;m lost</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/midi-in-im-lost/7792</link>
    <description>Hi

Just took the axoloti out of the drawer after a few years. I thought it could make a sweet tone generator for my linnstrument.

I grabbed a fresh axoliti install from github (im on linux/debian), build axoloti (the patcher, I guess) flashed the firmware, and the patcher starts with no errors. I have masic audio out.

I also have midi in showing up in the midi in put monitor, but I cant seem to get any midi into a live patch. Any suggestions what I should look for, and maybe a super simple midi-in + debug patch?

Also: there seems to be two mpe objects, are people using them or should I rather build everything from basic objects?</description>

              <p>Thanks for getting back! Yeah, I had the midi/in object, it just didn't output anything....</p>

<p>After a reboot of computer everything seems to be working as expected.</p>

<p>Now on to see if the mpe object is broken or I'm stupid....</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

              <p>Sorry if this seems basic, but have you put a midi/in object into your patch?<br><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d9ca5d4a1b37c758e24ad0f5a38a72ed551389c7.png" width="115" height="118"></p>
