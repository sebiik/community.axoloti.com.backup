    <title>Rbrt&#39;s Looper Blocks</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/rbrts-looper-blocks/2578</link>
    <description>Since a couple of people here use @rbrt&#39;s looper blocks for building loopers I thought it would be a great to Idea to exchange some patching Ideas here.

The first main topic to raise here is how to sync it to an incoming midi clock.

My aproach was to set the quantization phasor according to the incoming midi clock. I did this using @SirSickSik&#39;s Clock2timing. 

Then I measured how many clock ticks the loop is long and used this to set a retriggering engine.

As a last step I tried to emulate what the ableton looper does, changing the pitch when changing the tempo, just like the ableton looper. My main Idea here was:
Measure the tempo during recording the loop. Dividing it by the current tempo. Use the result to modulate loop speed.
When current tempo = original tempo, the result is 1 thus no change in pitch. When you half the tempo, the result will be 1/2 thus also also half speed plaback etc.

In order to divide two float values I used a script @logsol hacked together for me. It is however not completely accurate, so If anyone has better solution let me know.

This is the patch so far. (Using rbrts help patch as a start)

The next step for me is now Integrate this into my main looper patch. I want to have a really flexible system, where every loop could be the master loop, that also generates a clock. But it should of course also be able to sync to an incoming clock, but optional for each loop.
Or for example use the retriggering engine to force sync loops that have been recorded without sync. Many possibilites here :)</description>

              <p>Hi, excuse my ignorance as I am new to axoloti (experienced with Pure Data and coding though). When I load your patch a couple of modules are missing, they all seem to be from the folder rbrt/loopv2 which I don't have. Is there anywhere I can download them? Thank you</p>
