        <p>I use a patch bank file to switch between patches on the SD card. Therefore, I made a controller object, which cycles through patches when one of two buttons (connected to digital gpios) is pressed. The patches are loaded within a custom object that increases/decreases the patch index and loads the new patch via:</p>

<p><code>LoadPatchIndexed(i);</code></p>

<p>This works great, even when switching fast, but only when the patches are simple. When using complex patches, patches are loaded fast, and play instantly; however, when I want to cycle through complex patches fast, the software disconnects saying:</p>

<p>"Control transfer failed: -9"</p>

<p>If this happens, no patch is loaded and the axoloti is stuck until it is rebooted. Same thing happens when not connected to the software.</p>

<p>When I load a patch, wait for three seconds and then load another one, everything works fine. When switching too fast, it breaks most of the time for complex patches. Strangely enough the patches already play as intended when switching to the next patch, but still it seems that loading was somehow not finished yet. Any ideas?</p>
