    <title>Patch that does like GRM Tools Freeze plugin</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/patch-that-does-like-grm-tools-freeze-plugin/2237</link>
    <description>So is it possible to make a Patch that does like GRM Tools Freeze plugin ?!
i would love to be able to &quot;live stream&quot; a piece of audio and freeze a part of it, and be able to decide where in the sample it should loop, how long and so.. im a bit on shaky grounds here :slight_smile: 

I suspect its possible to buffer sound into the sdram or something but how would one do that sorry for being all neewbie here :D

              <p>Also, if you watch inside contrib/jt/devel (or some folder like that) there should be a patch made by Johannes with a granular streaming object inside, that hacks some sdram functions and allows for some quite dramatic granular synthesis (although with few controls)</p>

              <p>Granular synthesis. I made a couple objects about it, the problem is that for such a smooth playback a huge number of grains is required (and that requires more resources than axoloti actually has)<br>I also suspect that the window shape (the amplitude envelope for grains) is important to achieve a smoother sound. Again, the problem is that "curved" window shapes, like hanning, hamming, tapered cosine, welch, etc require more calculations than a simple triangular or rectangular shape.</p>
