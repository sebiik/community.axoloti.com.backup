    <description>[https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/touch-overlay-with-usb-mouse-connection/5341/11](https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/touch-overlay-with-usb-mouse-connection/5341/11)

I started this thread a couple of days ago since I was getting kinda frustrated about how to fix the mouse module to get absolute X/Y from the mouse-position data instead of relative mouse-movement data.
Since then, about 48 hours in 3 days, I&#39;ve come across several parts of the firmware code that handle USB-mouse messages. Although I&#39;m starting to get a grip of what has to be done to make this work, I just can&#39;t find all the codes which need to be changed in order to get my absolute mouse positions.
I&#39;ve read a thread by technobear where it&#39;s stated that it shouldn&#39;t be that hard to change, so please, come forward, and help me tackle this thing...as this whole thing is getting me pretty frustrated..</description>

              <p>I guess I didn't really understand, but is it a normal mouse? Not a trackpad? Because I find it impossible to get absolute position data with a regular mouse, since it's sensor only reads movement in two axis from a starting point.</p>
