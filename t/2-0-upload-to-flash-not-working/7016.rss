    <title>2.0 upload to flash not working</title>
    <link>https://sebiik.github.io/community.axoloti.com.backup/t/2-0-upload-to-flash-not-working/7016</link>
    <description>I know, 2.0 is not stable, but I also tried unsuccessfully to downgrade, and some features of 2.0 look good to me. However upload to flash or sd card doesn&#39;t work. For SD card the process looks OK and I see the start.elf into home directory, but when axoloti reboots the patch is not loaded. Same for flash. When using file browser I can upload the start.elf, and patch is loaded so to use it not in live mode and axoloti app down, but after reboot it&#39;s not loaded. Any help..? Thanks</description>

              <p>UPDATE/SOLVED: found that upload works if I unplug the MIDI IN, or electrically deactivate from my MIDI sender sequencer. Thanks</p>
