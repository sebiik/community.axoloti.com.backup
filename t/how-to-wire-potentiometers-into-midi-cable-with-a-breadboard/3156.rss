    <title>How to wire potentiometers into MIDI cable with a breadboard?</title>
    <link>http://community.axoloti.com/t/how-to-wire-potentiometers-into-midi-cable-with-a-breadboard/3156</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve bought a bunch of potentiometers and the like plus a breadboard and MIDI adapter for my project, and I want to connect all of them to a single MIDI cable to go to the Axoloti core. How would I go about doing that? Or is it best to wire them directly into the axoloti core?</description>

              <p>Are you saying, you want to connect the potentiometers to send MIDI data down a MIDI cable into the Axoloti ? If this is the case, you need to connect the pots to a device that translates the details into MIDI messages.<br>You can certainly connect them directly to the Axo pins, you can get some connection details from here,<br><aside class="quote" data-post="1" data-topic="1284">

    I'll be working on revising this post here, I was going to write it in a text document but realized it would be easier for me to get all the images if I just made it here. I was looking for a a save feature so I could wait to post until complete but could not find it. So please note this is all a work in progress and NEEDS further revision/information.

VDDA is the analog refeâ€¦
