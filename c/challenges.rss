              <p>Hi,</p>

<p>Everyone knows how expensive are these devices, so we can emulate one using axoloti using butons of loops, play and cue to start.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>This is the second part of the Fellowship of Axo challenge.</p>

<p>In this part we take 'seeds' from part one of this challenge , and tend and nurture them, and the reap the fruits ... or in plain speak simply take one or more seeds from <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/fellowship-of-axo-seeds-of-inspiration-challenge">Seeds of inspiration</a> and use it as inspiration for a track <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p><strong>submission date : open ended, feel free to pick a seed and develop it, and put the post the results here.</strong> </p>

<h2>Restrictions</h2>

<p>only rule is you have to use at least one seed, detail here which seed(s) you used.</p>

<p>apart from that no rules. you can use the seed 'as is' ,or mangle/edit/change the seed beyond the point of recognition. you can use whatever you want to produce the track, e.g. daws/synths/fx - as long as Axoloti plays some part in the track.</p>

<h2>Submissions</h2>

<p>post entries in this thread - either as soundcloud or youtube links.<br>include a reference to the seed(s) you used in the track</p>

<p><strong>note:</strong> it looks like everyone is busy, so Ive decided to make this an 'open ended' challenge, with no end date, so you are free to add new seeds or new fruits at any time. the more seeds added, the more fruit we can grow <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <h1>Fellowship of Axo - 1 of 2</h1>

<p><strong>Submission date: open ended, feel free to add more seeds at any time</strong></p>

<p>The "Fellowship of Axo" challenge centres on collaboration, exploring with others.<br>Part one is about providing seeds of inspiration to other musicians, which they can plant and grow to fruition in <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/fellowship-of-axo-reaping-the-fruits">part two</a>.</p>

<p>For this challenge, your task is to provide a seed of inspiration, something that can be used (and abused) in part two. To encourage participation, I'll keep it vague, but my ideas are</p>

<ul>
<li>an audio source  : a sound, part of a track, a melody </li>
<li>a patch :   an instrument, a sequencer</li>
</ul>

<p>the seed can be as simple or as complex as you like, sometimes, a tiny snippet of audio is all that's needed to take us off into a new direction.</p>

<p>In  <a href="//community.axoloti.com/t/fellowship-of-axo-reaping-the-fruits">Part Two (reaping the fruits)</a> musicians can take one or more seeds, and use to create a piece. they will be free to use it in anyway they see fit, either in part or in full, recognisable or not <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>When creating the seed,  we are all restricted in time, so make it simple for your fellows, if your submitting a patch, consider an audio snippet too - perhaps your fellow might choose to use just the audio.</p>

<h2>Restrictions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Axoloti must be a major part the seed creation</li>
<li>Seed must not include any copyrighted material </li>
<li>To use the seed (in part 2) must not require anything other than Axoloti</li>
</ul>

<p>you can use any tools you wish alongside axoloti<br>e.g. its fine to use a synth, and use Axoloti as an FX (if the FX is the major part of the submission), or flipped around use Axoloti as the sound generator and use external effects.<br>again, samples ( in accordance with copyright) , synthesis, fx -  all is game for creation.</p>

<h2>Submission</h2>

<p>demonstration - either video or soundcloud link, demonstrating what your offering as a seed. embed a link here, the name of the game here, is make it simple for the fellowship to get a glimpse of the potential of your seed.</p>

<p>'The Seed'  - depending upon what your seeding, you can provide an audio file, or patch or both.</p>

<p>Audio File - which can be used directly as the seed for part two.<br>post link here - WAV format, hosted on a site that does not require registration.  (Id recommend dropbox, via a shared link) , try to keep the size 'reasonable'... I personally don't want to be downloading GBs of samples <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>Patch - you can post here and/or you can upload to community library and provide details here</p>

<p>lets get sowing .... the more seeds we sow, the more fruit we will reap.</p>

<p><strong>note:</strong> it looks like everyone is busy, so Ive decided to make this an 'open ended' challenge, with no end date, so please feel free to add new seeds at any time... and hopefully someone will pick it up to develop it.</p>

              <p>lots of tech talk on the forum, anyone fancy a simple challenge to tip the balance the  other way a little ?</p>

<p><strong>Challenge</strong>: make a 'piece' of music using Axoloti </p>

<p>any style, any duration... any definition of the term music <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> <br>submit as many as you have time for, but must be made between now and end date (15th March and 29th March) - no previously released stuff.</p>

<p>no votes this time, its all about sitting down and making some music, here and now with Axoloti.</p>

<p><strong>End date:</strong> 29th March (two weeks from now)</p>

<p><strong>Restrictions:</strong> just one, all sound generated and effects used must come from Axoloti, so you cannot use external synths or effects (software or hardware) - thats it.</p>

<p>to keep it as open as possible:</p>

<ul>
<li>you can use daws or other hardware for multi-tracking/loop/sequence/mixing or whatever</li>
<li>you can use samples in axoloti</li>
<li>as you can multi track, you can of course use as many axoloti patches as you wish</li>
</ul>

<p>mixing, I guess we can allow some subtle eq/compression, but lets keep it subtle, unless its done in Axoloti, then it can be as wild as you like <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> </p>

<p>this means no clever patching/programming is required, some simple axoloti patches are all you need, and you can glue it together with other tools you have.</p>

<p>of course, this is fully inclusive... if your thing is detailed patching/sound design/generative music, thats welcome too, whatever floats your boat.</p>

<p><strong>Submission:</strong> post a link to soundcloud, you tube etc  in this thread.<br>please make sure its an embedded link, people are unlikely to want to start downloading, and visiting other sites.</p>

<p>if you wish, you can also share any patch or patches in the community library, but <strong>this is not a requirement</strong> for this challenge.</p>

<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>for those just starting out, the tutorial and demo patches give the basics for all you need for this challenge</li>
<li>for those who may not have been keeping up with axoloti development, 1.0.12 introduced some new oscillators (brds) and effects (clds,rngs,lmnts)  - with these you can easily create nice effects and instruments e.g. a brds oscillator into a rngs/reverb, is simple but really effective, that anyone can patch in minutes</li>
<li>the community library has a lot of objects covering many areas, just don't get overwhelmed in the choice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully wherever you are on your Axoloti journey, you can join in and have some fun, and use it as an excuse to 'focus on the music'</p>

<p>(any thoughts/suggestions, feel free to post below)</p>

<p>Hey, I have a challenge if anyone fancies it, it's called "The VHS Challenge" <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/heart_eyes.png?v=3" title=":heart_eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":heart_eyes:"></p>

<p>It would be cool to see "VHS" in the library. The VHS audio system adds a unique, solid character to the sound being recorded/played to/from tape (an interesting system).</p>

<p>As a quick read-up, here's a quote from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote><p>VHS Hi-Fi audio is achieved by using audio frequency modulation (AFM), modulating the two stereo channels (L, R) on two different frequency-modulated carriers and embedding the combined modulated audio signal pair into the video signal. To avoid crosstalk and interference from the primary video carrier, VHS's implementation of AFM relied on a form of magnetic recording called depth multiplexing. The modulated audio carrier pair was placed in the hitherto-unused frequency range between the luminance and the color carrier (below 1.6 MHz), and recorded first. Subsequently, the video head erases and re-records the video signal (combined luminance and color signal) over the same tape surface, but the video signal's higher center frequency results in a shallower magnetization of the tape, allowing both the video and residual AFM audio signal to coexist on tape. (PAL versions of Beta Hi-Fi use this same technique). During playback, VHS Hi-Fi recovers the depth-recorded AFM signal by subtracting the audio head's signal (which contains the AFM signal contaminated by a weak image of the video signal) from the video head's signal (which contains only the video signal), then demodulates the left and right audio channels from their respective frequency carriers. The end result of the complex process was audio of outstanding fidelity, which was uniformly solid across all tape-speeds (EP, LP or SP.)</p></blockquote>

<p>With that, you have an explanation of the process that would effectively need to be modeled in Axoloti.  And there's a twist, because this challenge takes you out of your coding zone and drags you back down to the same level as us mere cable-connecting types.  Yup, you have to model this technique using the objects already available so that others can learn from it.  Coding objects is cool, but completely useless for non-coders who wish to see how it's made, what makes it tick etc, so you must do this by connecting objects that are already available in the factory set.</p>

<p>So there you have it, a fun challenge if anyone is interested, and looking at the Wiki description it's an interesting system in it's own right.  No pressure, no deadlines, no prizes, but you do get bragging rights if you produce a VHS patch that is genuinely convicing, and is based on the same process that VHS audio uses. </p>

<p>Basically a stereo audio-in, followed by your VHS patch, followed by a stereo audio-out <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/grin.png?v=3" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>I’ve decided to start a topic / challenge for the creation of a collaborative “General Midi” library.</p>

<p>The aim is to have a bunch of patches, easy to use, and useful to learn understand basic axoloti patching. It would be great to cover all the main sounds included in the GM 1 sound set, but it’s only names, so we’re very free to do whatever it inspires us. It’s not very important to be realistic, everybody has probably very different visions of what a synthesized acoustic patch may sound like, many sounds are synth oriented too. <br>All kind of synthesis are welcome, and we can propose multiple patches for the same patch number (we can never have enough warm pads).<br>If you use wavetables or samples, you need to host them somewhere, and link here, with your patch. <br>You can share your patch by using your contrib patch folder or host it directly on this thread (or both).</p>

<p>Lets try and keep the patches simple to use (midi note, velocity, note on, mod wheel <span class="hashtag">#1</span>, pitch bend, aftertouch... if needed).  They should respect a certain logic concerning polyphony (a piano’ish sound should be playable with at least 8 voices, but a bass a lot less)</p>

<p>I will update this post with links to the thread post that includes your patch. </p>

              <p>Hi everyone!</p>

<p>I'm new to axoloti and could do with some help creating an FX patch to run a korg volca through, if anyone's interested? It'll be mostly used for livening up percussion loops on a korg volca sampler, as part of a larger live techno setup.</p>

<p>I used to own a nord modular, and i have basic building experience in reaktor (not core, unfortunately), but finding it hard to translate that knowledge to the axoloti. I've attached a basic attempt at what i'm looking for. I'd be massively grateful If any of you could help improve it.</p>

<p>I'm looking for something along these lines...</p>

<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/e875b8e1f664b1afd8ebc1821cf17f6244e10262" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e875b8e1f664b1afd8ebc1821cf17f6244e10262.jpg" class="lightbox" title="axoloti-patch.jpg"><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/e/e875b8e1f664b1afd8ebc1821cf17f6244e10262_1_666x500.jpg" width="666" height="500"><div class="meta">

<p>here's the patch i've made myself - <a class="attachment" href="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2681379cf0865aa8c3d260f1c99217c98449a972.axp">FX_chorus filter echo.axp</a> (20.5 KB)</p>

<p>i don't really know what i'm doing, and there seems to be a lot of noise from the input.<br>Any help at all would be greatly appreciated!</p>

              <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> dynamic/generative patches.</p>

<p>Create a patch that "simulates" an ecosystem, with one or several lifeforms interacting with each other. Of course the result should be audible, not necessarily musical or harmonious, but it should represent the current state of the ecosystem.</p>

<p>If you have no idea where to start, consider that you could break the problem down to a number of counter objects that represent the population (or use filter/integrator if you like math) and add/subtract units based on the current conditions (presence of food, competing organisms, deaths by age, etc)</p>

<p><strong>Submission window:</strong> Yet to be defined, but expect it to be near the end of june</p>

<p><strong>Voting window:</strong> Some days after submission</p>

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Volume knob, clearly visible and on top of the patch</li>
<li>Some parameters to edit the initial conditions of the patch and a reset button to restart the simulation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Voting criteria:</strong> Two polls will be created, one for the best patch art-wise, one for the best technique used (you should explain your patch if you aim to this award)</p>

<p>Good job and nice patching <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley.png?v=2" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> (also write something here if you intend to partecipate, you'll help the shy users come out of their shell!)</p>

<ul>
<li>volume and tempo control at top of patch</li>
<li>2 parameters for real time composition control e.g. Density/Pattern/Resolution/Scale</li>

<p><strong>Voting Criteria:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Usability</li>
<li>Tweak-ability</li>

<li>use modulation sources</li>
<li>use presets</li>
<li>use patch/patcher for polyphony rather than axs (due to single file constraint)</li>
<li>you can use firmware samples for percussion, but no external samples (due to single file constraint)</li>

              <p>The idea behind monthly patching challenge is to have some fun <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>There are no prizes, but everyone wins, as we get to see great patches, and learn from how others patch.</p>

<p>Even if you don't have a chance to create a patch, please come and vote on patches, and feel free to ask how they work etc.</p>

<p>The challenge theme is announced at the beginning of the month, allowing the whole month to get your patches ready, you can then submit your patches at then end of the month,  and then voting commences at the beginning of the following month.</p>

<p><strong>Process</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Challenge is set by previous winner at the beginning of the month</li>
<li>The challenge post can be used for discussion and clarification during the month</li>
<li>Patches are not revealed until the submission window opens</li>
<li>Submission window open for the last 3 days of month (usually), users then can submit patches on that thread.</li>
<li>On the 1st for the following month the submissions are closed and a poll, is created of all submissions, not further entries will then be accepted, it will remain open for 5 days.</li>
<li>the winner is then decided, and is then given the opportunity to set the challenge for the following month.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would hope that the challenger, will also 'run' the challenge for the month, e.g. rule clarification, setup challenge and posts etc. </p>

<p>any issues with running a submitted patch should be reported to the creator of the patch on the discussion thread or by PM.</p>

<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>patches must run on the current released version of the Axoloti software.</li>
<li>patches may not included any copyrighted material, please include details of source of material if this is likely to be question.<br>(this is already in T&amp;C of forum, but a reminder, we don't want legal challenges on axoloti.com)</li>
<li>samples - there may be some limits imposed on size for technical reasons.</li>
<li>please include an obvious gain/volume control and set it 'low' initially<br>(this will not count towards any 'parameter limitations' contain in the challenge) </li>
<li>you must adhere to the additional restrictions within the challenge</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Voting Criteria</strong><br>The challenge can include its own criteria for voting, though likely voters will tend to vote for what they like.<br>The following are hopefully useful things to bare in mind for voters, challengers and patchers alike</p>

<ul>
<li>Ease of use - parameters obviously placed, presets ease of 'install'</li>
<li>Relevancy to the theme</li>
<li>Sound and Musical goodness</li>
<li>Patch tidy-ness </li>
<li>Creativity</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Who can enter?</strong>  anyone who can create a patch for Axoloti, and you need to be registered here, to be able to make the post.</p>

<p><strong>Who can vote?</strong> anyone with an Axoloti, as you need to try out the patch</p>

<p><strong>Who sets the theme for the month?</strong> the winner of the previous months challenge, except if they set the challenge, in which case it will be the runner up.  </p>

<p><strong>What themes are likely?</strong> we hope as varied, as axoloti is flexible. so if you dont fancy one month, check back another month it could be very different. Also have a go anyway, you may discover/learn something interesting.</p>

<p><strong>Can I re-use others sub-patches?</strong> Sure, but please include a credit within your patch for 'derivative work' unless its change beyond all recognition.</p>

<p><strong>Can I submit more than one patch?</strong> Sure. but please keep to only one version of a patch.<br>(this may be subject to change, if we find the number of entries becomes unwieldy)</p>

<p><strong>Can I update a patch?</strong> Yes during the submission window, after than no. if you update please remove the old version, and include a date/time of update, this will allow others to know its changes since they last looked at it e.g.    mypatch.axp  (Update: 01Jan 20:15CET) . Please bare in mind, voters may not necessarily retry a patch, so better to get it right first time <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>Reminder: patch must be self contained in one AXP file.</p>

<p>VOTING WILL BE ON THIS THREAD, it will be by a <strong>POLL</strong> created when the window opens.<br>you can try patches before voting begins, but please bare in mind patches may be updated.</p>

<p>Hope everyone has had fun patching, and theres still time if you haven't had time yet...<br>Im looking forward to trying the submissions <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>TIP: <br>you dont need to download patches to try them...simply<br>a) Right Click link in web browser, select 'Copy Link' (or whatever it is to copy links to clipboard in your browser)<br>b) In Axoloti, File menu - Open in URL , then paste the link , OK<br>c) hit LIVE <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/smile.png?v=0" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> </p>

<p>note: this does mean the 'link hit count' will not in increase on this website, so submitters don't assume the hit count is representative of the number of users trying, if they do the above, which is the easy' way it wont increase the count.</p>

              <p>You know, a new year is beginning and the community is almost 1 year old! And therefore is obviously time for a patching competition! </p>

<p>I was thinking about something like this: a competition "theme" is decided with a public poll (something like kick drum synthesis or evolving soundscapes or granular synthesis) and anyone who wants to partecipate has to keep his work "secret" (not sharing it with the community) until the competition ends, in order not to bias other partecipants or the jury.</p>

<p>Patches are submitted to a jury (it could be like 3-4 users) that has to rate several factors, such as (for example)<br>-relevancy with the theme<br>-sound goodness<br>-patch tidyness <br>-creativity award </p>

<p>In the end an average vote is calculated and the winner wins something (prize is yet to be decided)</p>

<p>Patches can then be published and displayed to the community.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>
