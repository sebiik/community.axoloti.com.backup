              <p>I wanna make an object that takes a bunch of midi notes from my AKAI APC mini and remaps them so they work with my 1010music blackbox. </p>

<p>I did so going the patching route, but its quite inconvenient, cause I have to make it polyphonic, so I can press several buttons at once.</p>

<p>So the way to go is a custom object but I failed doing so at various attempts.</p>

<p>So I'm wondering if somebody has something like this ready maybe or tips on where to start?</p>

              <p>I'm creating a multi-pole morphing multimode filter which uses some internal non-linearity shapers.<br>Thing is, after adding a "switch" function to select between the different shaping types, it suddenly asked way more then it should (when using the same "default", previously used shape, it asked 5% more than before.. does the switch-function really adds so much cpu usage??)</p>

<p>So, instead of this, I thought it might be a good idea to use a function-pointer, that's being used within the filter-objects, but to which I can assign a certain function when the selector changes.</p>

<p>I'm trying my best to find out how to do this on the internet, but all the examples I run into are way more complex than I need, containing all kinds of extra code of the threat starters, making it pretty hard to see what is the basic "build up" of a function-pointer. So could someone help me out on this and show me how to make a simple function-pointer?</p>

<p>The basic functions I'm using are build like this:</p>

<p>int32_t SIN(  int32_t in  )   //just a single input<br>{<br>       SINE2TINTERP(  in  ,  in  ) //some kind of math function<br>       return in;      //returning the result<br>}<br>int32_t COS(  int32_t in  )   //just a single input<br>{<br>       SINE2TINTERP(  in + (1&lt;&lt;30)   ,  in  ) //some kind of math function<br>       return in;      //returning the result<br>}<br>for a start, I'ld like to have a function pointer that I could embed in a filter like  *SHAPE(....) </p>

<p>int32_t *SHAPE() and int32_t FILTER() would be put in the local data and *SHAPE() should be pointed to some function in the krate code along this line (though this seems to be the wrong way..)</p>

<p>if(param_shape==0)<br>{<br>  SHAPE()=&amp;SIN();<br>}</p>

<p>int32_t FILTER(  int32_t *in,  int32_t *val,  int32_t f  )<br>{<br>    *val  =  ___SMMLA(  *SHAPE(  *in  )  -  *SHAPE(  *val  )  &lt;&lt;1  ,  f,  *val  )  ;<br>    *in  =  *val;<br>}</p>

<p>So can someone tell me the right syntax to do this?? Or point me to an axoloti object that uses int32_t function-pointers, so I can find out myself?</p>

              <p>Hello,<br>I´ve been coding some objects lately and after a fair amount of sweating I´ve come to the conclusion that you can´t change the value of an outlet inside a FOR function. Is this right?<br>What I´m doing is an object for controlling the leds of a nanokontrol 2.<br>I´ve got 30 bool inlets (one for each button) and four outlets connected to a midi/out/cc any object:<br>-Value (frac32.positive)<br>-CC (int32.positive)<br>-Channel (int32.positive)<br>-Trigger (bool32)<br>In the K-Rate code section I write all the inlet states into an array, and then I use a FOR function for comparing these values with another array with old values. If they have changed the outlets are supposed to change to the corresponding value, cc, channel and send a trigger to let the midi/out/cc any object know it should send a cc message.<br>It should be pretty straight forward, but it doesn´t work. It seems that I have to have another array for storing if any inlet has changed, and then concatenate 30 IFs for sending messages if there has been any change in the inputs.<br>This seems to work, but it feels like very sloppy programming. <br>So, is this right, or am I doing something wrong and it should work inside the FOR function?</p>

I can see that there "might" be a performance advantage, but in most environments I would suspect the compiler optimizations to take care of something like that while the code stays better readable with star and slash operators instead of double angle brackets.<br>Why so much bitwise operation in axoloti objects? Is it a simple question of style or is there more to it?</p>

              <p>Hi folks,</p>

<p>I just made a Max patch to extract assigned CC values directly from Axoloti files from my HD.<br>(so I can update my controller with the init values of all CCs)</p>

<p>I was just wondering if this is something that could be done on the Axo itself? <br>I'm not super familiar with C+ and the compilation/file system Axo behavior.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>The dropdown-menus for Parameters in the patcher app has these conversion-presets such as <code>frac32.s.map.pitch</code> etc.<br>Where in the code are they defined, are they functions? It would be handy to re-use them, applying them to inlet-values</p>

              <p>Hello Axo peoples ! </p>

<p>Im trying to get midi sync messages into the axo UART PA3 method , with hug patch as a starting point.</p>

<p>I have a good setup where I can send and receive CC , notes and reroute it to internal midi as expected.<br>Now .<br>When I try to get the clock messages , I do receive the status correctly ,<br>But when trying to send it back to the internal axo port , this doesnt seem to work . Any idea ? <br>I know by a fact that system messages only have 1 byte , so I assumed I could send the other 2 with 0 . </p>

<p>Would love to know whats the way axoloti handles this MidiInMsgHandler and why is not getting the clock  pulses , start , stop etc </p>

<p>I have tried <br></p>

<p></p><pre><code class="lang-auto">MidiInMsgHandler(MIDI_DEVICE_INTERNAL,port,0xf8,0,0);
MidiInMsgHandler(MIDI_DEVICE_INTERNAL,port,248,0,0);

MidiInMsgHandler(MIDI_DEVICE_INTERNAL,port,0xf8,data,0);</code></pre>

<p>just to check if Im missing something , but I hit a wall .Thanks for any suggestion</p>

              <p>Hey!</p>

<p>I am trying to port some filters from faust to axoloti and I am having some trouble executing a standard function. What is the correct way to get <strong>tanf</strong> to work?</p>

<pre><code>Generate code complete

/Users/logsol/Documents/axoloti/build/xpatch.o: In function `PatchProcess(long*, long*)':
xpatch.cpp:(.text+0xc0): undefined reference to `tanf'</code></pre>

<p>In the output log I see that math.h is being included and when I search this file, I do see a reference to tanf in it:</p>

<pre><code>...
/* Single precision versions of ANSI functions.  */

extern float atanf _PARAMS((float));
extern float cosf _PARAMS((float));
extern float sinf _PARAMS((float));
extern float tanf _PARAMS((float));
extern float tanhf _PARAMS((float));
extern float frexpf _PARAMS((float, int *));
extern float modff _PARAMS((float, float *));
extern float ceilf _PARAMS((float));
extern float fabsf _PARAMS((float));
extern float floorf _PARAMS((float));
...</code></pre>

<p>Can anybody shine some light on this? Or maybe I should be using another tangent implementation altogether?</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

              <p>Hi,<br>For some kind of thesis I'm currently working on physical modelling algorithms (mainly Digital Waveguide) and I'm trying to implement some of this on a Axoloti board. It works quite well so far but since I code everything in float, I sometimes struggle with conversions to fixed point.<br>Basically I want to convert a pitch parameter (which should be a midi note) to the corresponding frequency in float. I want to use MTOFEXTENDED() for that to avoid a power calculation but I wasn't able to get good results there. Here is my piece of code: </p>

<p><code>uint32_t p = midi_note*(1&lt;&lt;27);<br>MTOFEXTENDED(p, freq);<br>freq_float = freq*(float)(1.0f/(1&lt;&lt;27))*sample_rate;<br>LogTextMessage("freq = %f \n", freq_float);</code> </p>

<p>So in the first line I want to convert a midi note (integer range 0 to 127) to q5.27 fixed point, then I call mtofextended and in the third line I convert to float and multiply with the sampling frequency to get from a phase increment to an actual frequency. As an output I just get super high numbers, which don't make sense at all. Can anyone tell me what I'm getting wrong here? Is mtofextended probably expecting an other fixed point format than q5.27?<br>Thanks in advance for your help!<br>Best, Flori</p>

              <p>So I've been tinkering around for a few weeks trying to figure this out. I'm looking to do a mpe keyboard split to control two different mpe sounds. So I want one sound to only respond to channels 1-8, while the other sound would only respond to channels 9-16. As of now it seems that the architecture of sub patches when in mpe mode defaults to listen on all 16 channels and there currently isn't anything I can see where you can choose channel ranges for each sub patch.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a way in which to choose a range of midi channels for mpe play, or how this functionality could be added in somehow? I was thinking the actual code of the patch/patcher object would need to be altered, but wasn't sure. I feel as if I've hit a wall with my current knowledge. </p>

<p>(Posted this in another thread but it was the wrong category, seeing if there's any other interest in adding this feature)</p>

              <p>I'd been looking for a way to convert images to tables and it seems this is doable using the "irfanview" program by saving an image as a ppm in binairy data <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>So right now I've got an ifft-oscillator running, that gets it's fft values by scanning through RGB-values of the image <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>So, to do this:<br>1. get an interesting image somewhere<br>2. use irfanview to "select a part and cut" or scale it to a nice size (say 512x128 pixels)<br>3. use color corrections and effects to adjust image. Turn up the brightness at least a bit to ensure black ain't really black, as this will leave a blank space instead of a value of zero, it seems, making the array shorter then it supposed to be.<br>4. save it as a .ppm file and set it to binairy in the popup file-settings window. After saving, open the file with notepad and remove the header (irfanview blabla, plus the extension of the size (this data ends with the width and height of the image, just remove this to only keep the RGB data. It won't be readable anymore by any program on your computer, but the axoloti still can)<br>5. put it on your SD-card and just load it with the factory table load module with extension .ppm (where you'ld normally put something like .tab).<br>6. depending on whether you save as .ppm, .pgm, .pbm:<br>.ppm-&gt; RGB pixels: table will give you 3 values in a row for each pixel, which are RED GREEN BLUE values from 0 to 255. then repeats for next pixels like: 46 63 83   66 74 46  34 10 244 etc), so an image of 64x64 will have 64x64x3 values in its table.<br>.pgm grayscale image version, haven't tried it yet, but guess it's just the greyscale values one by one for each pixel.<br>.pbm bitwise image, just zero's and ones.</p>

<p>also, another program seems to be very nice to convert table values between hex, string and binary:<br><a href="https://codebeautify.org/string-binary-converter" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://codebeautify.org/string-binary-converter</a></p>

<p>I have seen this kind of workaround in several places. I guess I have to use that?</p>

              <p>Hi, the title says what I am trying to achieve.</p>

<p>I found this article when trying to understand the decoding/encoding part. This would give me the mid and side as a single channel respectively. <br><a href="https://www.soundonsound.com/sound-advice/q-how-does-mid-sides-recording-actually-work" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.soundonsound.com/sound-advice/q-how-does-mid-sides-recording-actually-work</a></p>

<p>However, I believe I have to find the common signal to both sides and subtract it, so it seems to be a slightly different process. I tried literally subtracting the sides from each other in code but the result was mono.</p>

<p>I am unsure about whether the audio signal given comes signed or unsigned and how to handle the integer math stuff, so I am wondering if there is anyone who could solve it for me or explain <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> </p>

<p>Or maybe even an object that can do this already exists?</p>

              <p>A versatile synthesis technique that hasn't been implemented very often. The Qu-Bit Scanned is the only commercial / hardware implementation around that I know. There are a few source codes online. But I'm not skilled enough to translate them directly to Axoloti.</p>

<p>Here is the original article: <a href="http://www.billverplank.com/ScannedSynthesis.PDF" rel="nofollow noopener">www.billverplank.com/ScannedSynthesis.PDF</a><br>It works as a combination of a wavetable and physical modelling of a spring-mass-damper system. The system has a number of connected mass points that oscillate when excited. The structural oscillation ideally occurs at a 'haptic rate'; a low frequency. The wavetable is then composed of a scan of the mass points at every moment (or at least at a certain update rate) and is played at note frequency. So you're essentially playing the wave shape of the mass-spring system which changes through time at the much lower, structural frequency. What you get is a dynamic and organic sounding oscillator.</p>

<p>So far I have a rudimentary implementation that works, but it's not very robust. Still very sensitive to the setting of the masses (m), springs between the masses (k), centering springs (c) and damping (d). With 'mesh' set to 7, there are 128 mass points on a string with fixed boundaries.</p>

<p>To figure out and add:<br>- stability limits!<br>- adjustable update rate (in a way that will also save CPU)<br>- non-uniform mass and spring distribution (mentioned in the article that non-uniform settings really makes the sound more interesting, but also not implemented in the Qu-Bit module)<br>- different 'hammers' for excitation: pluck, sine, saw, random squares, ... and interpolation between them<br>- audio injection (envelope) for excitation<br>- different excitation methods: applied force, velocity, position release<br>- different mass point connection matrices and scanning sequences<br>- wavetable interpolation</p>

              <p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>I recently joined the Axoloti Core community (being from a PureData background) and started working on a Moog Taurus Bass Pedal clone.   I did a few iterations on Raspberry PIs in the past, worked great but the Axoloti Core is a much more elegant solution to me.</p>

<p>Now, I've got a nice patch emulating the Moog Taurus engine, it sounds pretty good.   I've been using the "Ladder1" object from Jaffa.  The filter is rather good but it is on the "conservative" side I would say.    I totally understand why as the Axoloti Core doesn't have tons of CPU to spare.    Ladder1 is based on the Karlsen ladder algorithm (from MusicDSP.org) and is very CPU friendly.</p>

<p>My Taurus patch consumes only 12-15% of the CPU so far, I'd be willing to "sacrifice" some CPU cycles to obtain a better Moog Ladder Filter implementation.   Back in my PureData days, I used a port of Antti Huovilainen's implementation (called ~muug) which sounded really close to the original.     PDF documentation here:  <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c490/4c04a7be1d675e360409178da71a1253f6d8.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c490/4c04a7be1d675e360409178da71a1253f6d8.pdf</a>    MusicDSP.org examples here: <a href="https://www.musicdsp.org/en/latest/Filters/196-moog-filter.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.musicdsp.org/en/latest/Filters/196-moog-filter.html</a></p>

<p>Researching further more on this topic, I found that there's a recent document on the subject, from Mister Dangelo (worked with Arturia and such) <a href="https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/bitstream/handle/123456789/14420/article6.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/bitstream/handle/123456789/14420/article6.pdf</a></p>

<p>Nowdays, I regret not listening in math classes! <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:">  I'm a software developer, mostly a Python programmer and I know bits and pieces of C/C++.    Used to do 6502 Assembler back in the Commodore 64 days, I can "decode" and hack my way around.   But this is something else!    I'd love to do this myself but it's a little over my head.</p>

<p>Copied Jaffa's object and tried to modify it, got no luck so far.   Is there any one around who's willing to take a look at this and help a poor soul making his patch better?   The community could also benefit from this...   Say for a "Minimoog" clone? <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Thanks in advance guys, </p>

<p>I am working on a patch where I think it would be nice with more than 16 voices polyphony.</p>

<p>But when making a patcher/patch object polyphonic, you "only" get up to 16 voices, you can't set more than that.</p>

<p>I tried embedding the polyphonic subpatch and switching out the attr_poly values everywhere in the patch with a static const of 32. It didn't seem to work. Also a bit impractical cause then the object will be code only and you can edit it as a regular subpatch.</p>

<p>I also tried changing one of the numbers from the attribute dropdpwn menu, but it didn't seem to do the job either. I got an error:<br>"Error: object "patcher_1" attribute "poly", value "16" unmatched"</p>

<p>Well I only get the above error when the patcher that I embedd has some content, if I do it on a clean patcher/patch, I didn't get that error.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was wondering if anyone has suggestion to making more than 16 voices polyphony?</p>
