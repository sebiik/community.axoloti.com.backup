              <p>Hi All!</p>

<p>Im very new to the Axoloti and love it so far. I could figure out most things by learning with the demos on right click. But I could not figure out how to use the Multiply Math thing.</p>

<p>My Problem is that i want the Expression pedal to have more effect on the midi cc output value. So multiply the incoming signal so to say. <br>Also I wanted to have a Max and a Min Value.</p>

<p>Can anybody help me out?</p>

<p>Regarding, Mario</p>

<p>I can hear it starts to go to feedback loop but the moment it starts it cuts off the audio. Any ideas why it's not working? Any ideas how to implement this or something nicer? So the goal is to add some Cpu friendly and interesting noise generating possibilities.</p>

              <p>Hi, i have been trying to control 2 parameter with a "Knob"(or midi CC ) on my synth patch. <br>The idea is to switch between 2 different envelope´s parameters (attack, decay, sustain, release) , so instead of using 8 knobs i only have to use 4 and a switch button.<br>i used a DeMux object to do this, seems like a easy thing to do BUT there is a problem!! </p>

<p>when you switch from A to B a zero value reemplace the last value you set on A and the last value you set on A erase the one you left on B.  </p>

<p>i have made a patch to solve this but I think it´s a little bit to complex and not very RAM friendly (imagine if i like to do this with more than 10 "knobs")...there must be a easier/more elegant solution, or maybe there is already an object that solve this problem.</p>

<p>the patch works this way: <br>1-you set "A" parameter value with a knob, then switch to "B" parameter ( in this moment a sample&amp;hold keep the A value so it doesn´t go to ZERO value),<br>2- Set the "B" parameter and switch back to "A" parameter (sample&amp;hold still active until the KNOB value hit the same Value the sample&amp;hold is holding and start to read the Knob value).   </p>

<p>THAT IT!! </p>

<p>IS THERE AND OBJECT THAT HELP TO SIMPLIFY THIS?</p>

<p>THANKS!!</p>

              <p>Hi.</p>

<p>I would like to use my Axoloti to sync my analog delay pedal to the midi clock coming from my Digitakt. The delay pedal (DOD Rubberneck) has a tap tempo input that only needs to be operated with a momentary switch. </p>

<p>How would I go about mimicking the press of a momentary switch from the Axoloti?</p>

<p>So far I would suggest a Midi Clock object connected to a digital pin out object. The output of the digital pin would the be connected to the actual delay pedal tap tempo input.</p>

<p>Does that make sense?</p>

<p>Best</p>

              <p>Hey!<br>I have a concrete idea for a delay with special settings and I would like to make this partly in the code (instead of getting for each calculation step a separate module) I just want to add/change some lines in code. But there is a lot of Bit sliding (e.g. <code>_mix&lt;&lt;2</code>)  and unknown functions (e.g. <code>___SMMUL()</code>)</p>

<p>I have not found anything on Youtube 'axoloti'. Does anyone have a tip where I can learn this kind of "data shifting" and its functions like <code>___SMMUL()</code>, or <code>__SSAT()</code>?</p>

              <p>Hi gang,<br>Firstly, my programming skills and technical understanding are hovering just above zero, so please forgive any silly questions.</p>

<p>What I would like to patch is a few (2, 3, maybe 4) separate MIDI clock OUTs - not USB MIDI.<br>I assume that MIDI being a digital set of messages should be able to be sent to any DIGITAL OUT, not just the default DIN MIDI out.</p>

<p>I found the internal MIDI clock object, found the BPM generator and the midi/out/clock.<br>The last one has a few choices, but that's where I hit the wall.<br>DIN is obvious, USB - not interested, internal port 1 and 2 - I read can be sued to send midi to other Axo objects. How? </p>

<ul>
<li><p>How do I define what is the considered an "internal port 1" of example?</p></li>
<li><p>Am I able to "steal" the clock from the "internal port 1" and send it to a digital OUT?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course I would like to be able to all use the "song position" and set that to for example 8 bars, so I get a phase sync as well as the clock. But that's later - I assume a synced pulse LFO could be used for that.</p>

<p>So, why...<br>I want to use two sequencers (Akai and Octatrack) both using a synced, but separate clocks, so I can stop one of them, load a new project (while the other is happily playing) and then start it with the new project and have it follow the phase and the clock.<br>I'm happy to set the BPM for the whole set using the computer, changing BPM live would be great of course, but probably well beyond me.</p>

<p>The more the merrier, but if only 2 can be made "int port 1 and 2" I can live with that.</p>

<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I would like to ask such question:</p>

<p>in superb example "Amon is broke" there is an object "ctrl / i radio 8 v" which can select variantions with mouse click.<br>How I could modify/replace this object to select one of those 8 variations with knob - which knob later I could patch into axocontrol object or map to external midi controller?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>The "stepnr" inlet is just an  0-7 counter. The three active step ("BLU1-3") controls work as intended. The probability control ("BLUprob") is giving me trouble though: when probability is turned up to max the final logic OR object suddenly acts like an XOR - instead of triggering every step it triggers every step EXCEPT the ones selected by the 3 "active step" controls, effectively inverting the pattern. Lower probability values work fine.</p>

<p>Any idea what's going on here?</p>

              <p>Hello,<br>I´m making a patch in which I have a base value controlled by a ctrl/dial p object, and to that value I add a randomized value from zero to whatever I have dialed on another ctrl/dial p object.<br>Then those two values are added and sent to a frac32 inlet on another object.<br>In order to avoid sending a value higher than 64 I do some operations on the random signal to scale it so the resulting value received on the blue inlet never exceeds 64.<br>The thing is my patch is starting to get a bit big, and I have to take out stuff that is not needed in order to add the stuff I do need, so I´m thinking that maybe all that calculation is not really necessary, since doing tests on another simple patch nothing bad seems to happen if I do send a value higher than 64.<br>So my question is on the title: Is it bad to send values higher than 64 to a frac32 input, or it will just see it as 64 and just keep going? This seems to be the case, but who knows if it is messing with the code and might start having a wrong behaviour.<br>Here´s a picture of an example of what I´m talking about.<br><img src="//community.axoloti.com/uploads/default/original/2X/d/dd7cea7f81ea07bcbe32e78676c871cedf0e5b94.png" width="467" height="317"></p>

              <p>Hi, I need to understand something that is fundamental for me, the situation is the following:</p>

<p> My patch is connected to a UI with various knobs and switches, it also works stand alone without the aid of a computer, at each start the axoloti core loads the patch that I set as initial.<br> Now comes the crucial question:<br> Is there a way to recall the exact position of the knobs and selectors at startup?  A sort of ping at each control and subsequent update?</p>

              <p>Hey.</p>

<p>So, I've got this axo-based guitar pedal that has two footswitches plus a bunch of knobs. The first footswitch is just an on/off switch (faux bypass), but I want the other one to function as follows:</p>

<p>Single press (short): Turns something on/off</p>

<p>Long press (hold down): While holding this down, I want to be able to control hidden/secondary parameters with the knobs, i.e. I don't want the primary functions to move, nor turn on what gets turned on with a short press. When I release the footswitch, I want to be able to control the primary controls again. Obviously, if the primary function was knob at minimum, and secondary parameter was just set to max, moving the knob to control primary function again would result in a swift skip in whatever the primary function is. That's fine. The secondary functions I have in mind are more of a "set and forget before playing" sort of deal, and not so much something that will be messed with mid-song.</p>

<p>I've read about hook objects, I've tried using them, but I can't for the life of me figure out how to make them work to do what I just wrote. I just don't get the logic to unhooking or what I'm missing for it to work the way I want. Can someone with some knowledge mock up for me an example of the objects needed? I'm sure it's child's play for a bunch of you wizards. I'd really appreciate it, because I'm lost yet also inspired to create. Bad combination.</p>

              <p>So, yeah, I'm trying to add a LED to keep in time with an LFO, and I've got the LED connected to a PWM pin on the axo board (PB1). I've tried several times now to add the object gpio/out/pwm t3. It does work and the LED does light up and keep up with the speed of the LFO, but whenever I do add the object to my patch, other previously working pinouts stop working, namely PB0 and PA7. Even if I don't connect the object to anything, so it's just floating around freely within my patch, these other inlets just don't do anything anymore. They were previously connected to 10K pots. WHAT!? I assume it's because these pinouts are outlets inside the object, but how do I use only the PB1 pinout without the rest of the object canceling out my original plans for PB0 and PA7? HALP</p>

<p>edit. I figured it out. Don't know how to delete thread. I just removed the outlets I didn't need from K-rate and Init-code. My first time messing with the code. Very spooky.</p>
