              <p>Hi, I want to buy a Axoloti, but is impossible to contact the seller. I send an email or by facebook and never replies. The problem is that where I live in Canary Islands I donÂ´t pay the same taxes as in the rest of Spain, so I should pay none because I pay anothe type of taxes when the product arrive.</p>

              <p>One of the things I love about this forum, is that its always been a very friendly forum with everyone helping each other, sharing ideas filled with people from different backgrounds and experience and willing to listen to each other.</p>

<p>of course, there have been the occasional disagreement, but with very few exceptions, this have tended not to escalate - again a credit to you all <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>we do try to moderate lightly here, hoping things will disperse quietly, and I really appreciate that you all take your part in this, by letting it fizzle out, rather than feeding it.</p>

<p>I'd particularly like to thank those of you that flag posts that are inappropriate, rather than fuelling the 'issue' - we appreciate it, its really helps the community.</p>

<p>of course, if posts/users becomes excessive, repetitive or abusive, we will take action.<br>we want axoloti community to remain a happy, inclusive and open place to share ideas for everyone. </p>

<p>Thank you for making this place great ... you've built a fantastic community here  <img src="//community.axoloti.com/images/emoji/twitter/heart.png?v=5" title=":heart:" class="emoji" alt=":heart:"></p>

<p>I'd like to end on a couple of tips, that perhaps some are unaware of...</p>

<p>please flag ALL posts that you think are in appropriate <strong>even</strong> if its already flagged</p>

<p>discourse has a couple of cool community features,<br>multiple flags on the the same post (from multiple users) will 'auto hide' it.<br>multiple flags on a topic, will temporarily close the thread.<br>multiple flags on posts by a single user, will prevent them posting for a short while.</p>

<p>the aim of all of these is the same, <br>it stops the 'issue' spreading further - until a moderator has time to come and deal with it.<br>also as a moderator, if I see multiple users flagging I can see its a concern to more members of the community.</p>

<p>finally,  if any regular would like to help with moderation, please contact <a class="mention" href="/u/johannes">@johannes</a> <br>more moderators does not mean more moderation, rather it means incidents can be handle quicker, the moderation load can be spread.</p>

              <p>Yesterday I ordered one piece of Axoloti Core. Payed with PayPal.<br>Checked afterwards to see if the payment was done. Yes, the transfer was made on the address of johannes.taelman@gmail.com. Checked with my bank account and the money were sent.<br>Then I checked out the axoloti website and it says that my order state is "cancelled" (?!).<br>I wrote about the problem to the address I made the payment to on PayPal, to johannes.taelman@gmail.com, attaching the image with the page that says that the order is "cancelled", and the recipe of the payment, but I got no answer.<br>Please help me with some advice, if anybody knows where else to address this problem.<br>If Johannes Taelman is reading this, please check the email, my order is <span class="hashtag">#4275</span>, placed on September 23 2019. </p>

<hr>

<p>26 september 2019 EDIT: </p>

<p>The cancelled order is 4275, though the PayPal receipt states "Invoice ID: WC-4276".<br>So if anybody is trying to solve this, might check on both order numbers; might be that 4275 was cancelled by me because one credit card was not accepted by Pay Pal, but still, I payed with another card, and the transaction was sucessful. If this is the case, the (successful) order <span class="hashtag">#4276</span> doesn't appear in my account, only <span class="hashtag">#4275</span>, that is cancelled.</p>

<hr>

<p>BTW, there are at least two problems with the axoloti website:</p>

<ol>
<li>On the buying page is written that it is possible to order paying directly by card if you don't have a PayPal account, but actually there is no such option.</li>
<li>There is at least very difficult, if not impossible, to login into the axoloti website to see your order status. There is no login button. The only way to login is to make an order, go to the checkout page, and there is an option to login, but after that you have to let the order uncompleted. Still not sure if logging in to the community (this) website, keeps you logged in to the axoloti website, and if it does, how do you get to "my account" page afterwards, to see your order status.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you,<br>Dragos Andriana.</p>

<p>Just a warning/advisory:  The Axoloti online order form is NOT encrypted / not SSL secured.  While it is true that if you use Paypal your credit card information will (hopefully) be protected, credit card numbers are not the only hazard!  Any orders of Axoloti are sending your name, address, house number, phone number and Email unencypted and in the open.  This is a real problem in regards to the potential for identity theft and is absolutely not up to modern web privacy standards.  I would recommend any potential Axoloti buyers refrain from making purchases until this issue is fixed, as will I.</p>

<p>also slightly concerned about the address as when i submitted i saw that its listed as Street name followed by house number which is the opposite of how addresses are done in the US at least. not sure if that's a big deal.</p>

<p>Gitlab told Motherboard that the company gained 50,000 new projects in the lead up to Microsoft's announcement that it acquired Github.</p>

<p>To me it is really disturbing that Microsoft have purchased Github for some petty stocks. 13.000 projects all ready moved over to Gitlab. I went for these DIY/community platform exactly to get away from being a slave of big companies, like Microsoft. And now it seems like this is where its going anyway, which is imo really really bad. </p>

<p>What do you guys think about this?</p>

<p>What does it mean? Do Microsoft then own the rights to use everything thats on Github? Any legal experts in this group? :=) This is pretty essential.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/johannes">@johannes</a>, have you thought about using something else than Github, Gitlab for example? Or any other platform that would be free of any corporate influence?</p>

<p>If anyone have some thoughts about this, doesnt matter how mad complicated or whatever, just post them so we can get to the bottom of this and what it actually means for a platform like Axoloti.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

I'm a hack of all trades, a master of none... so really appreciate real world experiences of others with which I can learn from.

              <p>So I found the correct way of adding objects to the contrib library. Wouldn't it be an idea with a wiki where I could add this for-me-new-found-info so the next guy can easily find it? Obviously most things ATM works like this: play around with axoloti, if the user get's in trouble, search the forum, if you can't find it, ask. But a more structured "manual" would be great.</p>

<p>Huge task, I know, but for starters a wiki with fragments would be great. As more info is added, we could start grouping it and build the wiki to the point where it's a more-or-less complete manual.</p>

              <p>It would be handy for support purposes if users included details of their setup in their forum profile.</p>

<p>to do: click on your profile, top right icon , then select 'gear' icon (preferences), fill details in the 'about me' field... you can of course add other interesting info too if you wish <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=2" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  </p>

<p>most useful is the operating system your using, and its version  e.g. Mac OSX 10.11.6, Windows 10<br>(other hardware controllers etc, might be useful too...)</p>

<p>then with one click on your badge we (and other users) can see which what your setup is, very useful if a question or issue about the Axoloti UI is related to your operating system etc. <br>(its easy to forget to include this in posts, so we end up asking, and this takes an extra post or two to clear up)</p>

              <p>Another website forum that I tend to follow daily is the PJRC (Teensy) forums.  They have a forum category they call "Project Guidance - Advice on project feasibility, which parts to use, how to accomplish it."   I cannot begin to tell you how much I have learned just from this forum category alone!   I really think the Axoloti forum could benefit from something like this.  It is obvious that Axoloti users and developers are embracing the open source nature established but an area for newbs like me to ask..."Is this possible and if so what do I need to do to make it happen? would make things sweeter me thinks.</p>

I'm in California, Bay Area and ordered one of these amazing devices and although it's only been a couple of days I am already fraught with anticipation!

              <p>Hey <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=2" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> </p>

<p>I would like to suggest that a topic "solved" function should be implemented into the community. That would make it easier for everyone to find answers to their issues. The overall thread could have "solved" mark so when searching you can see which ones have been solved. And maybe also the post that solves the topic should have it too.</p>

<p>For example yesterday I posted a question about embedded objects and it was pretty quickly solved. It could be tagged as solved to make it easier for users to find "definitive" answers.</p>

<p>What do the main developers think?</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/johannes">@johannes</a> <a class="mention" href="/users/thetechnobear">@thetechnobear</a>  </p>

<p>Thanks</p>

              <p>Ive enabled tagging of topics on the forum.  (and also the ability to filter)</p>

<p>perhaps in the long run this might help users find key topics..</p>

<ul>
<li>anyone that has been here awhile (level 3) can create tags, but obviously try to re-use as much as possible.</li>
<li>you can only tag at the topic level (i.e. as the topic creator) , you can edit/add tags later</li>
<li>when adding multiple tags, press tab between each one. (otherwise it will combine into multi word tags)</li>
</ul>

<p>we could bulk update topics with tags, by searching and adding, but i don't think its worth it, as you'll get the same results if you do a simple word search.  (and i don't have the time to selectively go through posts adding tags) </p>

<p>IF you have a handful of really good posts that you think would be good to tag (and you cannot add, as your not the owner)... <br>then comment below with a link and suggested tag, if you don't include a link, I'm not going to search for it <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=2" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> </p>

<p>(again, only a handful of links don't do a search and expect me to sift through them for 'good hits', I just don't have the time.)</p>

<p>also if you have recommendations for tags feel free to suggest.. (though easier if it has a topic to show its use!), </p>

<p>id suggest...  thing thats are not already a category e.g. we dont need programming/hardware, as they are categories.<br>things that can already be searched/filtered e.g. user posts are already searchable.<br>I guess I prefer one word tags, but I dont know how realistic this is <img src="/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=2" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
